Soft accents and conversations are great, but difficult to follow, since you do not understand what they are saying and without captions.

"b""`` Just Married '' is a painfully extravagant movie that is almost very light and cute. Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy play a couple of Romeo and Juliet that has been repeated in so many films, it's revolting - he's the classic sports fan and the son of middle-income parents, and she's the daughter of a few billionaires. whose profession we never learned. Her parents preferred to marry her with the snobby Peter Prentice, a boring antagonist who is more of a hindrance than a real character. Anyway, the cute couple get married and travel to Europe, where their lies and unbelievable circumstances (they are expelled from a hotel after they spoil the circuitry trying to connect some kind of sex toy) hinder their fun. perfect honeymoon. The film was compounded by bad jokes, boring characters and clich & egrave; stories. I think I thought I'd laugh once. The terrible thing about this movie was how everything was unbelievable. Each character was able to pull a beautiful and comforting monologue from the air. Most of the speeches did not even fit the personality of the character, for example, Kutcher's character gave at least two of these monologues, and each one was one of the best parts of the script. Too bad they came out sounding awkward and clumsy, since the character was not supposed to be the brightest lamp in the box. Finally, the characters were painfully underdeveloped. We do not know whether Murphy's character likes to be rich or not, nor can we really discern whether she's a rich girl or an art-loving intellectual. We never find out what Murphy's father does, and although a good, strong relationship between father and son is suggested between Kutcher's character and his father, we never know for sure. Finally, an attractive blonde was constantly around the character of Murphy ... she was a sister? friends ? cousin ? That bothered me throughout the movie. So why not a star instead of two? Well, Murphy and Kutcher proved to be excellent actors with amazing chemistry together. Murphy especially brightened up the screen with his dazzling personality and soft, scratchy voice. Kutcher will forever be typified as the dumb face, but it's a character that matches well with him. I found them to be the only highlights of the movie. Bottom line: This movie kept me awake. It was quick and moderately pleasant, but something new or different was missing. See if you like fliks teen chick, not if your idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8ba movie is one that will keep you thinking.""",0
"b'I may not be able to add much to the comments, whose compliments I entirely agree with the content of this magnificent film, but I still felt compelled to offer my two cents on BluRay, which is equally fantastic. With the full measure of the glorious winner of the background of this now legitimately restored story in HiDef, the plot\'s inherent drama finally finally finally has a screen equally worthy of being presented - a fact Perpetually lost in every other presentation of video I\'ve seen before. It\'s actually an awe-inspiring revaluation as to the intended impact of this movie and, from any and all previous video issues of it, in fact a transformation from a first-class adventure of acceptably good scale to a first-class and global adventure. a remarkable spectacle! I daresay I do not approach myself looking so good when I remember seeing him at my local theater all those years ago. By the way, it looks so good, I do not think anybody would dream, with their appearance here, that this movie is actually wrapping its 50th anniversary. Of the opening credits, I see that the film was originally filmed in 70mm, so in much more detail than the most common 35mm films have. You can expect a similar performance on HiDef with other 65 or 70mm films, like 2001: A Space Odessy or Lawrence of Arabia - IF the disc transfer is good - and here it certainly is. The image inside the frame on this disc is always, and absolutely, as firm as the Rock of Gibralter. There was only the slightest amount of jitter, as seen in my setup, but again only rarely and almost imperceptibly when it was seen - still not sure if the disc was actually at fault or not. Not a hint of moir\xc3\xa9, anywhere. The sound is very good and much better than I had any reason to wait. Although John Barry\'s great soundtrack originally appeared in mono, it\'s by far the best I\'ve heard of it - it even has a better impression than the original (mono) soundtrack available on CD if my memory serves. However, the range of sound effects on this disc is either real stereo or, more likely, derived from various elements of isolated sound effects and then ""panned"" during post-production. There are also some interesting extras: more than two documentaries about the film\'s production, movie reviews, theatrical trailer and even a brief but interesting interview with John Barry himself about the origins of his ideas for the soundtrack. But, after all, I love it when such a majestic and monumental film like this gets the real treatment it does here. Sometimes the presentation is everything! Highly recommended! !'",1
"b'I\'ve been a 3D nut for many decades. I pre-ordered this from amazon and man, what a disappointment! The quality of the video is just slightly better than the 3D bootleg of the 90\'s shutterglass (and at least the 3D DVD was FULL SCREEN) that was made from a Japanese VHD 3D disk. Even the 3D ""red / blue"" trailer for this movie (from the 3D Film Expo at the Egyptian Theater here in Hollywood) was full-screen. If you use Google in this title, you will find some sites with photo comparisons (PAL, NTSC, DVD, Blu-ray, etc ...) and you can clearly see that this 3D Blu-ray cuts the movie from ALL FOUR SIDES. Just a little bit is cut from the left / right, but it lacks a bit of the top and bottom to create that ratio of 1.85 in full screen. Part of 3D perception is lost because of this, and it\'s probably what others here meant with certain scenes looking like `` flat \'\' or `` 2D \'\'. One of the most remarkable scenes is the one in which Margot and Mark are talking in the livigroom. This wonderful photo is obviously set to 3D effect. Margot\'s hand rests on the final table in the extreme foreground, displaying that beautiful diamond ring. Guess what ? In this Blu-ray 3D version, your ENTIRE hand is completely cut! I watched these cut scenes throughout the movie ... characters cut through the trash, bits of cut-out lamps, etc. Yes, it\'s great to see that red dress look really red, but unfortunately the colors are severely overrated. I think I\'ll grab hold of `` House of Wax \'\' or `` Creature FTBL \'\' until criticism comes from other guinea pigs out there, LOL! I\'m sure others will agree that the black ink printed on the Blu-ray disc itself looks awful. I\'ve seen better labels on pirated DVDs! Anyway, just my 2 cents.'",0

"b'If you look closely at the fine print of this DVD, you will see that it is not approved by the Wayne Foundation. And the boy shows it. The picture quality of this DVD has all the signs of being a DVD recording of a VHS copy of the movie.

I have a VHS tape that has a better picture than this DVD. Everyone please write to the Wayne Foundation and tell them about the poor quality release of this movie!

"b'This movie is based on a true story, and I saw the original story of ""A Haunting"". ""I was hoping the movie version would give me a more frightening version of the original story, but all I got was a bad acting, a dull plot and terrible effects.

"b'... but a terrible DVD. The sound is simply old Dolby Surround and the movie is full screen. I find this very annoying. I always liked Joshua Tree and waited for the DVD release. I imagined widescreen, Dolby 5.1, trailers, comments and motion menus. But none of this happened. Artisan disappointed me so much with this poor and unimaginative release. I would like to start a campaign to get Artisan to change his mind. To get them to relaunch this amazing movie into widescreen. They should do this like this movie totally rocks. Even the current cover is painfully horrible. A grumpy photo of a Joshua Tree would be better. One last thing. Amazon and the back of the DVD claim that the runtime is 102 minutes when it is actually the unrated version 106. This version should remain intact in future widescreen release.'",0
"b'From time to time I revisited this movie. It\'s fun. ""El Dorado"" has its exaggerated moments, with James Caan talking about ""walking boldly"" in a poem about El Dorado, Maudie (John Wayne\'s love interest), where several Wayne women\'s films stopped: ""I will not cry . I\'ll just buy a pine box, about 6 feet for you, \'and then the necessary speech about how men are dumb to fight and women are pious for waiting valiantly for their men to come home, blah blah blah He has a helper (Arthur Honeycutt) who imitates Walter Brennen of ""Rio Bravo"", James Caan who imitates Ricky Nelson of ""Rio Bravo"" and Mitchum who imitates Dean Martin of ""Rio Bravo"" and finally Charlene Holt, who imitates Angie Dickinson in ""Rio Bravo"". \'\' See the pattern? `` Rio Bravo \'\' and `` El Dorado \'\' are essentially the same film. A sheriff, his assistant and John Wayne, his assistant and his girlfriend. Still, there is a good movie here. There are elements of Wild Woolly Westerns here. Christopher George plays the evil gunslinger who nevertheless heats up with Cole Thornton and John Wayne\'s SPOILER ALERT! In the end, there\'s a scene that is gold: George and his gang of bad men walk into the bar to see the other villain / farmer Edward Asner. When they enter, they play piano music and arrogate. It\'s straight from a shoot-em-1920. It is not a work of art. But it will entertain. It will grow in you with subsequent presentations. John Wayne is the last John Wayne with his John Waynisms. Mitchum is practically a spectator and goes through the motions. All in all, fun and a poem for movies of Formula Cowboy.'",1
"b""If you want to be alone while watching Alone In The Dark, there is good news and bad news. The good news is that you will have your desire. The bad news is that misery loves company. Being hung by incarnated nipple clusters over a well of cacti and scorpions would be less painful than sitting through this garbage menage about aliens, monsters, nefarious scientists, abducted children, a paranormal and Tara. Reid as curator of museums. Pinch me, I must be dreaming. Better than a pinch of what a slap in the face, that's what this crap a movie provides. Alone in the Dark is supposedly based on an old Atari game, which I've never heard of. What I remember about the old Atari games were their rudimentary graphics and stories. I doubt the story of the film is even a consideration. So in order to fill in the blanks, writers Elan Mastai, Michael Roesch and Peter Scheerer lend and steal from other films. Best movies. Movies that make you realize that you're not just watching an imitation, but a really bad imitation, like Chuck Norris doing his homage to Judy Garland. I admit that his version of the Easter Parade left me in tears, but only because he was kicking me in the face. That was what it seemed like to see Alone in the Dark. I do not care about stupid and stupid horror movies, but I hate stupid, stupid horror movies that refuse to acknowledge this fact. Alone in the Dark comes with a poker face impossible to know if we should take this seriously. We are, but we are not, or more precisely, we can not. There is no room for maneuver in the script, direction or performance. Government conspiracies abound in Alone in the Dark, which meets paranormal investigator Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) joining an elite group of government agents to defeat an ancient evil. As an orphan, Edward escaped the clutches of the unscrupulous government agent / scientist Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker), whose depraved experiments turned children into half-blooded zombies. Now that Hudgens has found the final key to open the portal between darkness and light, it is up to Edward, former lover and healer Aline Cedrac (Reid) and command leader Burke (Stephen Dorff) to save mankind. whom I would call when definitive evil decides to attack humanity: two actors riding that straight path to the video and an actress better known for shimmering paparazzi. Was that a selection or return decision? Director Uwe Boll (The House of the Dead) does not help much, never allowing actors to step out of the thin paper box or express any emotion beyond the written word. If everyone in front of or behind the camera just recognized the obvious, Alone in the Dark would have been a joke. Computer generated monsters that never seem to be in the same frame as the actors, happy trigger commands, a complicated plot that does not make sense, paper doll characters, all the ornaments of a good goofy time. Too bad the guys behind Alone in the Dark did not fall into this trap.""",0
"b""We continued to yawn as we watched this Sony stink. It's probably the worst digital animation movie we've ever seen, and we've seen all the big things. BUT, we give 2 stars and not one because it has some fun scenes. But these fun scenes are very few. It really is adult humor. Children can enjoy (we do not have any so we can not comment). Please do not waste your money on this movie unless you are sure your kids will like it.""",0
"b""Still disappointing. I really had hope, but between the lines of the maniac and the bad acting, it was very difficult to bear. I think the wolves chasing the vampire was the highlight of the movie. I missed any emotional connection completely, I think it was actually worse than twilight, if that's possible. It's quite amazing that with such a budget and a fan base, they still do not come close to getting it right. The cheese clothes, the makeup, even the soundtrack was poor.

"b""I do not know who I'm feeling anymore, Stephen Dorff or Christian Slater. Dorff, who is a great actor, although you never know about the movies he is in, has not been anything but remote since the original Blade in 1998. Slater's career has declined over the years, practically taking part in some flop projects . Both actors walk peacefully through their roles in this latest video game for the film adaptation of director Uwe Boll, the same guy who brought us another video game adaptation, the incredibly bad House of the Dead. Alone in the dark is not much better, with a story so non-existent you'll be scratching your head wondering what's going on before you pray for all to be killed. Tara Reid is also on board as the smart girl, and as previous reviewers have mentioned, we know she's smart because she wears glasses. There is no redeeming factor about Alone in the Dark, and if you have been subjected to the House of the Dead farce, then you know what to expect here.""",0
"b'This DVD attempt to cram in about an hour the entire history of North American exploration. Given its purpose, I believe it does a pretty decent job. It summed up five hundred years of history and many dozens of expeditions and explorers in brief bits of information. I do not think this is a good educational tool, as it would probably be a little uninteresting - it does not have very interesting stories, just a stream of information. On the contrary, this is a good starting point for someone who wants to research the North American exploration and would like an introduction to the major events and people in their history. Not really something to excite people about the story, people seeing this should already be excited.'",1

An ancient civilization once opened the gate between these two worlds before and was eliminated. Now the key has been destroyed (why not destroyed? They never destroy those things!) And sent to the four corners of the earth. Now, get everything that's been tidy, exciting, fun and interesting from an Indiana Jones-like movie and throw it on the table a few times. Immerse yourself, and put it in some movie with some inept acting and inactive rhythm. Set it on fire and there you go, Alone in the Dark. What a waste .""",0

"b'Before watching this, do not make the mistake of including this movie in idiot comedies like ""Tootsie"" and ""Mrs"". Doubtfire. Although based on a true story, director Greenwald eschews many western (and Hollywood) conventions of bringing one of the best westerns of the 1990s. Suzy Amis plays Jo, a woman who trusts a few bad men too much. After escaping to the west and leaving her son out of wedlock, she is nearly raped by two soldiers. To hide from them, she wears men\'s clothing and heals her face, eventually using her new facade to get what she needs in the West to survive. Ian McKellen plays a woman who plays her, believing her to be a young man. She finally befriends Bo Hopkins, who has her best role in years, and starts a sheep ranch. She falls in love with a Chinese she has been forced to hire as a cook, and must eventually fight with a clump of cattle trying to steady herself and drive out the sheep farmers. Amis remembers Eric Stoltz in his scenes as a man, and is totally believable. McKellan and Rene Auberjonois have small but important roles, such as older paternal figures, whom Amis trusts, but they turn against her. Bo Hopkins is great as the neighbor Amis tolerates, befriends and tolerates. David Chung plays the Chinese man nicknamed Tin Man as a junk addict addicted to opium. It looks perfect for paper, life scars and everything. Heather Graham also has a small role as Amis\'s lover, and does her best with it. The most amazing aspects of this movie is what the film is not. There are no cute scenes of `` Yentl, \'\' in which Amis falls in love with a man as a man. The cattle company\'s war, a standard point of Western plot, never dominates history, or comes to a trivial conclusion. The final scenes, with Jo\'s unmasking, seem almost a farce, but when thought later, they play with great sincerity and excitement, especially Hopkins\' reaction. Greenwald\'s camera turns a small movie into an epic, with a beautiful Montana scenery. His screenplay is also very clever, never going for cheap laughs or the kind of exploration that a male director may have sought. I strongly recommend `` The Ballad of Little Jo. `` This is assessed (R) for physical violence, strong armed violence, some sexual violence, gore, some profanity, some nudity, sexual content, sexual references, drug abuse, and adult situations.'",1
"b'I bought this DVD without having seen it in the movies or in the video. I bought it based on the strong comments I saw on the top ten lists at the end of the year. This is one of the few (just?) Great animated works that do not work like a musical. It depends solely on the strength of its characters to tell the compelling story of the young ""Hogarth"" (yes, Hogarth!) Who befriends a giant robot that fell to Earth during the 1950s. Of course, the military and other adults are suspicious of giant apparently benign. The real strength of this movie is that both adults and kids will enjoy it because it works on many levels. It\'s an astute commentary on the paranoia of the 1950s (without being heavy), an exciting adventure film and a comedy that has humor for adults and children. Both will fall in love with ""Iron Giant"" (voiced by Vin Diesal, from ""The Rescue of Private Ryan""), who eventually teaches humans one or two things about loyalty and sacrifice. A word of warning for those with very young children: there are some ""damn"" and ""hell"" (3 or 4) throughout the film; therefore, its PG rating.'",1
"b""I agree with Shemp Newberg's review. I have other Stefan Grossman DVDs, which I have adored. I have the one to start learning the bottleneck.

I think I'll look for another introduction to the bottleneck. On a positive note, there are fantastic historical clips of bottleneck legends, if you like that stuff (which I do).""",0
"b'Certainly the best Carmen I\'ve seen, plus the movie Sunday (I have not seen the performance of van Otter). The highlights are, of course, the performances of the soprano leaders Domashenko and Dashuk; both play their roles well, even if the first one is a bit unpleasant - but somehow I do not think Carmen was a lady of nuances. Just watch the beauty of them - they are really impressive to look at. I watched a Turandot a few nights ago (another Zeffirelli production) that was ruined as a spectacle because the princess was played by a lady who was the size of a hospitality tent (and also was not a great singer). Strangely, in this production, it is the male protagonists who raise an eyebrow; are middle-aged, overweight and visually unconvincing, and this lowers credibility, given Zeffirelli\'s emphasis on the ""visual"" of a production; it\'s hard to see how Jose and Escamillo could, in modern parlance, ""pull"" women like that! Okay, maybe the fame of the latter is a factor. As for the singing, the sopranos stood out, Berti was fine, Acelo mediocre and one or two of the very dishonest support singers. Maestro and orchestra were good. As another reviewer commented, it is not difficult to believe that all the families in Verona were represented on the massive stage, in addition to many tourists. There were more horses on the stage than they raced at the Grand National, and I think I saw my dog, who had gone for a walk, in one of the scenes. No elephant though. And yes, the constant pursuit of the male singers at the maestro\'s suggestion was annoying, but with so many people on stage, it\'s a pity they did not have to jump in the air to get the beat. Horses I really enjoyed the performance, more like a show than like a great opera. I think my dog \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bcame back too late.'",1

"b""It was the franchise's slugfest that fans thought would never happen except in the form of comic books. After years and years of failed attempts and false beginnings, the powers that finally came together. Hoping to capitalize on the surprise success of the merger of two successful horror franchises with Freddy vs. Jaso, two of the most popular science fiction creatures go all the way in Alien Vs. Predator with those pesky humans caught in the middle. It's not a clich\xc3\xa9; that this movie does not like. Disposable characters are broadly outlined. For example, a bottle cap worn around a character's neck is considered a defining feature. The film even manages to include the old chestnut where the characters surpass the fireball blast. Fans who expect the two alien races to start waiting for over an hour until the first battle, but it is quite impressive when they play around. like something out of a comic book. Of course, the fight scenes are pretty cool in all their CGI-assisted glory, but that's hardly an endorsement. Poor Lance Henriksen is playing here as a selfish businessman who provides the only human connection with the other Alien movies (it is hinted that he is the inspiration for the android bishop in Aliens). It is in only a quarter of the movie before being shipped quickly. There is an audio commentary by screenwriter / director Paul W.S. Anderson and the actors Lance Henriksen and Sanaa Lathan. They connect at the same time seemingly oblivious to the narrative mess that is this movie. Also includes an audio commentary by visual effects supervisor John Bruno and creator effects creators Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr. Anyone who likes to hear these details will find this track informative. There are three deleted scenes totaling two minutes and include a bit of Predator humor that was properly cut. Also included are two trailers and a gallery of comic book covers. for Alien from Dark Horse Vs. Series Predator.Alien vs. Predator was not worth waiting for and comic book fans will feel cheated. The movie begins slowly but once the Aliens and Predators start hitting each other, the weak script and awkward plot mercifully become the background. It's a shame because both alien races are poised for countless story ideas that subsequent sequences have not been able to capitalize on effectively. All we have left is a beautiful, numbered movie.""",0

It was omitted on the day the films were generally limited to two hours. The descent of the stairs is particularly memorable, not to give too much.""",1
"b'""Battlefield Earth"" is rightly considered one of the worst films ever made. This makes ""Manos, Hands of Fate"" seem profound, human and touching drama about the suffering in the hands of a cult and ""Plan 9 From Space"" feels a profound meditation on world peace and the dangers of science. ""Battlefield"" has more holes than Swiss cheese - and think it was a labor of love (!!!) John Travolta saw this movie as a tribute to L. Ron Hubbard. But it ended in a catastrophic failure. And no wonder. ""Battlefield"" has humans living in primitive conditions, at the mercy of the Psychlos led by John Travolta and Forest Whitaker. Human civilization is in ruins. The special effects, sometimes, especially with the ruins, are convincing. Too bad about the rest of the movie. Barry Pepper (who seems to have retired or something) is the hero, ""Jonny Goodboy \'\' not making this Kept prisoner by Psychlos, he can learn to read, fly planes, firearms -.. All in a period of extremely short time. As for Psychlos, what was your motivation in world domination? Gold! and yet they were not able to find Fort Knox after blasting everything to smithereens. Premise horrible, horrible acting, a gruesome scene between Travolta and his wife Kelly Preston in real life ... it\'s better to lose. This film makes you suffer Moment by Moment, Travolta and wondered if his career was Stayin \'Alive. at least your taste in movies camp has not changed since he starred as the mother of Tracy Turnblatt in Hairspray (Full-Screen Edition). Bad movie love is a battlefield.'",0
"b'The third installment of the popular & quot; Beverly Hills Cop & quot; series is like a distant relative who comes to stay with you. At first, you are happy to see them and get refreshed in the old days, but they certainly tire quickly. This movie gets to that point after about fifteen minutes. Eddie Murphy is back as Alex Foley, the increasingly unlikely fish detective out of Detroit. Once again, Axel is fighting against the law enforcement, the Beverly Hills Police Department and the bad guys who killed his friend. Sound familiar? Even Serge (Bronson Pinchot) is back in a desperate and painful scene that seems to last forever. The direction of veteran John Landis, of Murphy, is acceptable, showing the usual talent of Landis to stroll and to do acrobatics. The script of the normally trusted Steven deSouza, regrettably, is kind of overcooked. It is never clear what the tone of the image is. The action scenes are very unlikely and often played for laughter, while the comedy scenes are forced and bland. History never builds the sense of risk and conflict that is essential for such a film. It is not a riot of laughter, nor is it remotely suspenseful. Also, any movie that makes Hector Elizondo - one of the best character actors around - looking bad has some serious problems. There are two good things about & quot; Cop III. & quot; One is an excellent action sequence set in an amusement park Ferris wheel. This is the only exciting part of the movie. The other thing I liked was the special guest series from several famous movie directors (like George Lucas), a typical Landis joke. At least it gives you something to look for in some pretty boring scenes.'",0
"b""I agree 100% with another reviewer's comments ... If you love this movie, do not buy this DVD. This version is terrible. I watched it once and wanted to take the disc out, put it in my garage, and run down with my car - over and over again. Go back to the publishing school, Bill Jones. Truly insulting to anyone who is a fan of this movie. I would give negative stars if I could.""",0
"b'The acting in this movie stinks, laughable. Even Tara Reid can not save this movie. What, Reid is a scientist because he puts on glasses? She looks more like a fitness trainer. Is Christian Slater smarter? The direction is almost as bad as some of Ed Wood\'s films. The film may have had a science fiction plan, but the film hardly explored any part of its plot. The movie is not only bad, it\'s sometimes annoying, just spurred on by the fun of horribly executed script lines and mindless actions. Primarily, this movie incriminates its director. I give this movie two stars out of five. This movie had at least some visuals. I do not hate your stupidity as much as the other video game-based movie, ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse,"" which I consider the worst movie of its year.'",0
"b'These DVDs catapulted our sex lives. My partner and I find each other\'s ""buttons"" and we\'re having a great time. Since I\'ve seen the dvds, one of the things I love doing is peeking at her, and I got on really well when she\'s on top and desperate to go there. She seems to love everything I do during that time, and one of my favorite things is to keep her in that moment of intense desire for as long as possible, and as close as possible to go, before leaving her on the ground, or passing by top. These techniques have answered questions I\'ve had for a long time about how to please her - just to bring in more questions than I even considered before. We become VERY interested in exactly what she wants, every time we have sex together. My most recent question is this: do women prefer to rise slowly, and then descend a little several times, or would they rather stay on the brink of a long period of time? From my perspective, the taller it gets and the more it stays there, the more rewarding it is for me. When I ask what she likes, it seems to be what I did back then. I heard you kept her on the brink of so-called ""sweet torture,"" and would love to have the perspective of a woman. Like I said, we\'re really into her sexual pleasure, and I attribute that rekindled interest to her. part of the techniques given in the videos. Highly recommend it, but only if what you want is a super-charged sex life! ! !'",1
"b""Great Milestones is an exploration of the breeding habits and mating rituals of various types of animals. Interesting aspects of this subject are how the moon and the tides regulate and synchronize certain elements of reproduction and how the weather also play a role. Not only are terrestrial animals studied, but some types of underwater creatures are also shown. In the second half of this documentary, parents who protect and feed their newborns are touched. Finish is a look at the young animals leaving the house or nest in the fight to join the circle of life. With just 60 minutes in duration, this feature can leave you wishing for more. The sound, the narration and the video are very well done in my opinion. No bonus is offered, except for some trailers from other programs. The chapters are a bit short due to the time limit, but what is presented is fun and enjoyable, however. As diverse as the animal kingdom is, we hope Reader's Digest will make more of these kinds of documentaries. If you are a fan of this type of subject, we recommend viewing.""",1
"b'I am a Blu-ray enthusiast and a lethal gun enthusiast. So I was very disappointed with the quality of Blu-ray formatting for this (looks like DVD quality) but what really pisses me off is the fact that it\'s not the cut of the directors. I think maybe it was a little na\xc3\xafve to suppose it would be, but come on, it\'s BLU-RAY we\'re talking about here! I was not impressed. Not to mention that the salesman said he was in ""Good Condition"", but the spine and the back of the sleeve were severely wrinkled and torn. If this were a good quality Blu-ray conversion, and it had been the cut of the directors, I would not have minded the kneaded sleeve. However, as was not the case, the kneaded nature was the straw. I just checked Amazon, and there is not yet the Director\'s Cut available. Until then, I will not buy lethal weapons movies on Blu-ray.'",0
"b""This series was very reminiscent of series like Trigun, Full Metal Panic and Outlaw Star nothing seriously but fun, dramatic and funny enough to be very addictive. The first thing you have to realize is do not take most of this series seriously, but if you're looking for a dramatic series like Ghost In The Shell, Akira, or something, this series will not be for you as long as you have battles space mechas and some drama for most series is mostly carefree for the first season. The beginning of the Second Vandread Stage becomes a bit more dramatic and serious, though especially with the arc of history than the people of Earth did to the human colonies in space for their own agenda. The main plot of the series is that after about a century of masculine / feminine genres being separated and living in different worlds, they, for whatever reason, began to fight each other for personal resources and agendas. The stories on both sides about what the other genres are like also make the series very funny, such as when you hear the story in the male home world of how females are demonic and how they are going to eat their organs and are simply horrible. So begins the awkward journey of three males trapped in a ship by a crowd of attractive females after a battle between the sexes becomes chaotic and causes a merger of the male and female spacecraft. The cast has a wide range of funny situations that give a good laugh throughout the show and the characters are hilarious, as you see, when they try to interact between the sexes sometimes. The real beautiful couple in the series for me was Hibiki Tokai, a third-grader in his world who was basically just a humble factory worker when he got stuck aboard the ship because he boasted of bringing a vanguard, and Dita Liebely a bubbly woman pilot of the ship who wants to get in touch with her first alien and how she has never seen a male before seeing Hibiki as the first alien she contacted. The video is clear and sharp, so no complaints and the audio was also good. The cast of both Japanese / English was good too. Again, although like the recent Funimation releases, the set consists of four DVDs placed on two DVD covers and on a paper cover, the extras are not just the standard intro / finish songs without text and some trailers, but at least price not yet bad. So, if you like funny action sci-fi animes, here's a good one for you to look at the anime collection ...""",1
"b""The good news about this DVD is that it focuses more on Big Brother as a band, rather than exclusively on Janis Joplin, like other documentaries. Unfortunately, the sound quality is generally very poor, and the images are usually erased. This is especially noticeable because many of the same images have been used in other films like JANIS, MONTEREY POP, BIG BROTHER: BALL AND CHAIN, and various TV specials (A & E, Biography, VH1 and so on), so comparisons are very easy to do . I have re-editions of 78rpm vinyl records on CDs that have been digitally restored to provide a clearer sound than this DVD, and I have seen silent movie images restored in the same way, so I can only assume that this documentary was rushed with a eye fast buck and not much concern about the quality of production. That said, the DVD offers a fascinating insight into the band members at the time and right now. Some of them recall the Psychedelic Era with nostalgic fondness, while others have obviously clung and rehearsed their resentments for the last 40 years. If they had never met Janis Joplin, the Big Brother story could have been very different - if no one had ever heard of them, or if they would have become great on their own terms blues, we'll never know. But this DVD offers tempting glimpses not only of what it was, but of what it could have been.""",0

"b""I bought this DVD as a stocking stuffer for my husband. We watched together in preparation for an upcoming trip to Amsterdam. The film, which chronicles the life and struggles of the Dutch painter Vincent Van Gogh, was very well done and one of Kirk Douglas's best performances. At times, it was disturbing due to a moving description of Van Gogh's serious mental illness. Other strong performances by Anthony Quinn, who played the painter Paul Gauguin, and James Donald, who played the brother of Van Gogh, increased the pleasure of the film. The film was visually stunning and it was possible to see the evolution of Van Gogh's art. I look forward to my trip to see Van Gogh's art in person.""",1
"b""With the power of the star so high, you could reasonably expect this movie to shine much brighter. As it is, it's a tired mess that goes back to the much higher 'thrillers' of the' 90s. Halle Berry has a friend who is killed in an unusual way shortly after confiding to Berry that she was meeting and potentially blackmailing Bruce Willis, Healle Berry, being an investigative journalist, lures her friend Giovanni Ribisi (the best thing in the film, and the only real act with any ambiguity) to hide. Or under the covers, may be more appropriate. She poses online to find you in her favorite chat room, and as a temporary in her office, enticing him to get close enough to find out what she needs to know. Needless to say, twists and turns happen. Let's just say it immediately - watching people type instant messages to each other IS NOT exciting. And if you're expecting some frisson of tension or sexual action on the screen, you're probably too disappointed. Although advertised as an erotic thriller, the action is all internet-type and any supposed tension in the story is of the whodunit variety rather than whodunwho ... and it's a good thing that Willis and Berry will not fall and foul with the terrible fault of chemistry they seem to have, and lack of conviction in their roles that they exude. Ribisi is the only successful wild card in the process that leaves us in doubt as to the outcome. This ending may be a supposed turnaround but lacks the credibility to be satisfying, since the facts jump in the end as a cheap trick at an amusement park, rather than a thought-provoking moment that puts the pieces scattered throughout the film, on the way a better scripted effort could have been achieved. Disappointing, with appropriate appropriation of resources as the only extra. Maybe with the ridiculous about replacing the top product, they did not feel they needed money back from the movie ...""",0
"b'This is a decent movie, but I can not give it a better review because the transfer is terrible. The monogram, ER, of the issuing company is displayed throughout the film. This is definitely a low-definition version of the movie. Perhaps the system that the company used to add their monogram made the movie appear to be being watched through a gauze. There are also some places where the picture breaks down. This is really a shame because I liked the movie.'",0

The interviews are great, and the behind-the-scenes session with Crow and the Indigo Girls - they're teaching her & quot; Tried to be true & quot; - it's a little gem that (as another reviewer noted) captures the spirit of Lilith Fair beautifully. On the technical side: the camera work is wonderful, with close-ups and big angles for the feeling of being there. I actually would have given this 5 star DVD, but for the occasional bumpy sound. I can not comment on 5.1 because I only have stereo. But be warned that sometimes the volume falls suddenly and inexplicably; and in some places, the muddy mix deceives the listener, as in Crow's final moments, which otherwise would be beautiful.

"b""WARNING: this is not really a sequel. This is one of those movie remakes / mini-television series from a theatrical release. You will not have cinematic visuals, you will have quality TV visuals. A lot of people are not providing proper appraisals and this is more of a betrayal of their consumer. The original Storm Riders are an incredible fantasy story, that's not true. This is more like a standard kung fu action movie that uses the characters. Storm Riders had this feeling of fantasy, this does not happen. There's a good kung fu action, but this thing seems incoherent while you're trying to watch, and that may be because they tried to cut and paste the movie together, if my theory is correct that it was a miniseries adaptation. The story begins and stops without flowing. If you just want an action movie with some decent fighting scenes, it's tolerable, but it's by no means at the caliber of Storm Riders. I really want them to set a standard that differentiates TV adaptations from actual releases, such releases tend to be a bit insulting. The ONLY thing that is the rescue of this is a very cute actress, and that's it! I've never seen Wind and Cloud so unattractive, and this is based on Aaron Kwock and Ekin Cheng. These two are appropriate, but they are not substitutes.""",0
"b'Hollywood werewolves have been characterized as serious creatures who walk behind their victims as a Groucho Marx hirsuit. The image of this lopant werewolf was originally recorded by Lon Chaney and successive generations of actors just continued their style. But with John Werewolf in London, director John Landis not only pushed the werewolf back down so that he resembled nothing less than a mobile tank lycan, but also added a touch of humor needed to force viewers to move away momentarily of the blood to contemplate what they had just seen. David Naughton and Griffin Dunne are two Americans walking through a dark swamp in English, rising from the heights of Heathcliffe, WUTHERING HEIGHTS. They are attacked by a howling werewolf who kills Dunne, but only bites Naughton before he himself is killed by villagers. This introductory scene in which Naughton and Dunne are banned by a hostile group of pub drinkers is a haunting mix of frightening fear fermented with mordazity. It is precisely this mixture of horror and humor that suggests that the viewer engages in extremes of emotions ranging from laughter to gagging, with the viewer sometimes not sure which to choose. Jenny Agutter is a very underrated actress who shines like a nurse who falls in love with Naughton, and can not understand a radical change in her eating habits, since he increasingly prefers her extra rare flesh. Agutter adds an unexpected dimension to a role that, in the hands of another, less competent director, could have relegated her to little more than an attractive piece of eye candy for English eyes. Griffin Dunne provides visceral humor like a corpse that keeps popping up, like the ghost of Hamlet\'s father, at appropriate times to remind Naughton that the price to pay to get rid of the lycanthropy may be a little too high. And then there\'s the song, played in the same vein as Simon & amp; Garfunkle\'s letter from THE GRADUATE, but here the ""crucible"" of Credence Clearwater Revival Bad Moon Rising & quot; punctuates the scenes of transformation that a bad moon leads to bad vibrations. Finally, Rick Baker\'s special effects are impressive, as you can see bones lengthening, skin growth and nostrils lengthening, as Naughton is seen scaring himself as much as the audience. Ultimately, WEREWOLF AN AMERICAN IN LONDON is an innovator in the werewolf genre in that vision and sound combine to present creatures as helpless in their own way as their victims are on their own.'",1
"b'Amazon to its complete discredit is posting comments from two totally different movies as one! There are two versions of The Big Trail - a 35mm shot and 110 minute duration and released in 2003, and a new widescreen version released in 2008 with a duration of 122 minutes and shot in Grandeur 70mm and completely different in scale and impact. The important version, to add further confusion, comes with the first as a box set. Potential buyers need to be aware of this! `` Full Screen Edition \'\' will confuse many buyers - in fact, it\'s nothing like that, so I rate it the lowest rating. The film in its historical format deserves five FIVE STARS! and can be purchased from the set titled `` The Big Two Disc Special Edition \'\' which not only includes this lower version DVD but also the most important and immensely historic version of the movie\'s `` WIDESCREEN EDITION \'\'. was shown for the first time. Again, I would easily rate this widescreen editing DVD with five stars! The widescreen version is 122 minutes long and is taken directly from the original 70mm. The `` Full Screen Edition \'\' masked here as what it is not is not a jagged version of the widescreen image, but it\'s actually a shorter version (110 minutes) 35mm at the same time from Fox to most theaters in the world. day that could not turn the huge film. Yes, it\'s a real movie and certainly good - until you see the 70mm. My low rating is to draw attention to all these important details that are not mentioned in most of the positive reviews. Most of what makes this epic movie in scale is much better appreciated in a widescreen format, and not the totally confusing full-screen edition as offered here. I am usually tolerant of these awards in the television medium - watching the widescreen ""Lawrence of Arabia \'\' into anything smaller than a 60-inch screen is like peeking out a colored ribbon stretched out in the middle of the television. Faced with such a tiny image, it\'s understandable that many people opt for cut or \'full\' screen versions instead of but the main point of `` The Big Trail \'\' is the magnificent GRANDEUR format, a monstrous 70mm image offering breathtaking detailing of the vast panoramas that make up the film\'s settings. with the great black and white landscape photography of the best western photographers of America.If you have a large television screen, just try r ""The Big Trail"" on Widescreen on Fox `` Two Disc Special Edition \'\'. Once you\'ve seen the movie in its full glory on a good sized screen, you\'ll wonder why Fox launched ""The Big Trail"" in 2003 in a short and very misleading ""Full Screen Edtion."" To order the widescreen version of `` The Big Trail \'\' and see a milestone in American filmmaking, something absolutely spectacular as it was planned to be seen. The Big Trail My only complaint is Fox. The insistence on attaching the full-screen DVD to the Widescreen DVD and charging us for two DVDs when most viewers want to see only one version.'",0
"b""Although the 2006 Le Mans DVD looks similar to the previous incarnations, the extremely poor video quality due to a lot of distortion and pixelation definitely makes it the worst of the Le Mans DVDs. It's the same: very test and qualify highlights with just over an hour dedicated to the race itself. However, poor picture quality makes this DVD look almost like a VHS tape. The distortion and pixelation is sometimes hideous and really distances itself from the pleasure of watching the race. If you compare this DVD side-by-side with the Le Mans DVDs covering the 2002 and 2003 races, the 2006 edition is definitely worse. Another complaint is that the DVD covers highlights and qualifications twice - adding a lot of repetition to the DVD. s run time of 140 minutes. This has been a continuing habit for the producers of this series, who have piled themselves up in this featured show that aired on SPEED before their live coverage of Le Mans. This preview, which takes slightly more than an hour to cover tests and qualifications, leads to the actual beginning of the DVD, which then goes back for more tests and qualifications. The lack of special features and cameras in the car is another disappointment. In the 2005 DVD, producers included special cameras in the car for the first time (although the DVD had some pixelation problems). In the 2006 version, there are no special features and filming the camera in the car does not exceed a few seconds for each car that shows. It would have been great if there had been a complete lap in the car on board the Audi R10 Turbo Diesel. Overall I would still recommend this DVD to any Le Mans fan as it is the best disc of a race that saw Audi triumph a diesel car for the first time in the 74 year history of the race. He also does a good job showing all the action of the race and all the drama and glamor that make up the annual festival of resistance in the Circuit de la Sarthe.

Although I have to admit that some of the special effects generated by computer were impressive, the performance lacked any kind of substance. However, what bothered me the most was the incredible amount of product placement throughout the film. Mr. Spielberg was not sure he would make enough money at the box office to announce Aquafina, Pepsi, Gap, Lexus and Nokia throughout the film? Overall, I spent two and a half hours in the movie, during which I wondered more than once if all the people who were walking in the movies during the movie were as bored as I was.

"b'It\'s my fault that I have higher expectations for this movie, but I\'m guessing this movie was not made exactly for guys like me anyway. The acting is good, the character of Matthew McConaughey, Ben and Kate Hudson, Andie really have to act and react. The dialogue does not matter. The character of Kate Hudson always has the right side, which is good for a while, but after an hour gets tiring. It completely invades every aspect of Ben\'s life; we never see Andie\'s world apart from her two friends and workplace. So while both characters have a similar agenda, there\'s a complete imbalance of weariness, and that to me is the biggest gap in the movie. He fights all her attempts at ""losing"" him, but all this only produces frustration in Andie - and feeds her to do crazier things. As a spectator, you\'re dying to see her fall on your face just once. But this is an illusion. Ben\'s resistance to Andie\'s antics hardly amuses me, and Andie\'s total disgrace does not please me. Of course both are great, and Hudson smiles positively when she smiles, but man, 112 minutes is a long time to support this game. I can imagine some people thinking that this movie is great. Girl Power and everything. I do not know . But I think we can agree that the film was conceived as a vehicle for Kate Hudson\'s rise to stardom. This film reminds me a little of WHAT WOMEN WANT (with Mel Gibson) for a variety of reasons, but notably because it was written and produced by women - which in the world of male-dominated filmmaking is a much-needed perspective - but Nancy Myers (a producer / director of What Women Want) is definitely much smarter than the ""brains"" behind How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days. You just have to watch the extras on the DVD to see proof of this. We met two of the producers, who obviously had facelifts. I\'m serious . It is scary . They talk about the material as if it were Shakespeare. Then there\'s director Donald Petrie, who is totally lacking in charisma. MAKING OF with it is so cheap that it\'s probably funnier to watch than most of the movie. While he is there talking, a TV monitor behind him shoots pictures of the movie, and an office worker (with his back to the camera) stares at a static PC screen while biting his nails and shakes his head a lot. She does this throughout the duration of the interviews with Petrie. Oh, and did I mention the background music that accompanies the extras? It\'s department store. Or elevator music. That you always hate more. I did not bother with the comment. Donald is a pain in the ass. There are no outtakes, which is now unusual for a comedy. The deleted scenes are really good, some honest emotions are shown by Andie and we have some quieter moments between the two tracks. Look, it started well. It looked like it would be harmless cute romantic comedy, but the romance lasted about 10 minutes. I can summarize my criticism with this remark from director Petrie because he was interested in directing the film. He says it was because he discovered Kate Hudson was attached to him. Aha So basically, if the film does well at the box office, then it will launch Hudson\'s career and career. Sorry Petrie, but that\'s not good enough for me.'",0
"b'""Ring Around the Rosie"" starring Gina Philips (""Jeepers Creepers"") and Tom Sizemore (""The Rescue of Private Ryan""). I was interested in their names, but unfortunately the film is terribly annoying, although it takes less than 90 minutes. Gin Philips plays Karen, a young businesswoman who inherits a house in a remote place inland that may or may not be haunted. Near the house lives a caretaker played by Tom Sizemore, who may or may not be possessed by something evil. The premise is very familiar, recently used in films like ""The Amityville Horror"", and with the right direction, the film would be exciting. But you will soon realize that there are no emotions of any kind, not even a surprise. by a sudden big sound, in ""Ring Around the Rosie"", which introduces many pieces of recycled images seen in other thrillers - from rudimentary tricks like shadows moving behind the door, a strange reflection in the mirror, strange noise at midnight or not trusted neighbor looking at the protagonist, at the heroine plagued by nightmares and his buried memories of the past. The film also has a lovely boyfriend of Karen (Randall Batinkoff) and her adorable little sister (Jenny Mollen). The first one leaves the house while Karen stays to clean the house; the last one gets there and what Karen sees and hears starts to get weirder. Considering the nature of the conclusion and suggested history of Karen\'s childhood (which I can not reveal here), there may be some psychological explanations about the strange events that terrify Karen, as in other thrillers like ""The Others."" \'\' That\'s what I thought while trying not to sleep, but no matter how I try, I can not find one in this disconnected story that is confusing and illogical. If you see a character falling from the window and another character catches you in his arms in a cartoon-like way, you realize that this is not a good psychological thriller.

The four murderers mentioned here - Charles Manson, Henry Lee Lucas, Ottis Elwood Toole and Kenneth Bianchi - receive disproportionate coverage. Manson is not seen, which can be a blessing, considering the crazed interview I saw him give. Henry Lee Lucas also earns little turn, but Ottis Toole, his partner, may have the most worrisome situation. Although convicted and imprisoned for what is said to be unbelievable 700 deaths, with Luke, Toole gives the impression that he did not do any of them. This is not to say that he is totally unfounded, since he freely admits several acts of arson, but states that he confessed to the murders based on the information the police gave, that is, that he wanted him to be guilty, so he Thank you. The study by Kenneth Bianchi, known as the Hillside Strangler, also addresses this behavior that psychiatrist Martin T Orne defines as sociopathy of the textbook. But while it is easy to believe that Bianchi in his interviews is pretending, it is more difficult to accept that Toole is with his character and facade smiling. Maybe this just makes Toole the best actor, since Orne also believes Toole is a serial killer. Bianchi's initial defense for his murders was a multiple personality disorder, and when Dr Orne proved to be a forger, denying the testimony of other psychiatrists, Binachi left the farce and was found guilty, although the bargain for evidence against his accomplice would reduce the number from 14 victims to 7. This video was made in 1987 and it is said that Bianchi was on parole in the 1990s, something that Dr. Orne believes has a good chance of getting from Bianchi's tactic of no remorse - none memory was gaining alliances. However, while Toole's face reveals an idiot child amused by his own play, Bianchi is the banality of evil, a soft surface that can not be trusted. The video concludes with survivors of serial killers, including the mother of Sharon Tate, who meet regularly to monitor condemnation murderers' conditional hearings. One can only imagine if they were able to influence Bianchi's release, since Orne predicts that once this form of obsessive / compulsive behavior is exercised, there is no stopping. In Dr. Orne's opinion, no matter how good the prisoner Bianchi had been, once free, he would resume. Some may feel sorry that these men escaped the death penalty because they were in states where it was abolished, and the idea that life imprisonment is a form of punishment worse than execution is diluted by conditional and good behavioral conditions of service. This may sound harsh, but Dr. Orne says there is no civilized method of punishment effective enough to be an impediment - the best that can be done is to keep the perpetrators isolated from the rest of society. There are no parallels between the killers seen here, with no similarities that could explain what triggered their actions. If we are not able to understand their behavior, at least we may be grateful to have been interrupted, at least for a while.""",0
"b'That\'s the way this movie was announced when it came out in 1981, in the classic sense of Universal Monster - a movie of monsters. \'\' As a divorce son, I had a weekend dad that would take my sister and me to any movie, regardless of the rating (well, within limits) and this scared us silly. I remember sitting at the movies and watching the transformation (having seen the transformation of Lon Chaney Jr. into ""The Wolf Man"", I was familiar with the lineage of the genre and the example that this movie had to live ... having seen ""The Howling"" later (not long after, since the movies almost competed with each other in theaters) I was a big fan of Rob Bottin and his mentor, Rick Baker (not to mention the late, great Dick Smith and splatter, Tom Savini), I was just glued to the screen during one of the coolest effects of all time, just amazed at what was happening, and just scared the credibility of everything when compared to the stop-motion transformation of the Chaney makeup) not to mention the scene with David Naughton (`` be a Pepper! Drink Dr. Pepper!) And Jenny Agutter in bed (not to mention the shower) ... yowza! (Well, I was 11 years old). The only thing that bothered me about this movie is the lack of what was supposed to be an extremely bloody scene that Landis cut because it subjugated the scene that came after it (supposedly, the audience was so upset and shocked that they babbled the whole scene of the dialogue that followed by David waking up in the wolf\'s pen at the zoo): the scene was the increase in the murders of the vagabonds on the quay, and I do not do that. I think it comes to this new DVD version of the movie (which is a bummer, because the Robocop expansion of Verhoven (Criterion edition) actually works better than the version approved by the MPAA). Anyway, this is really a big hit. ""movie of monsters"" in every sense of the word ... is coarse, funny, sexy, explorer in various ways (the book ""Splatter Movies"" calls this porn gore), truly a Landis movie by force is a joke and orgy of automotive chaos, and offers great acting and casting (even in small roles). like the Pakistani shift worker at the hospital and the punks on the London subway). Just a fun movie on all sides, with truly amazing and Oscar-winning effects (still looking incredible and believable ... nothing digital comes close!) I\'ll say it again: digital, but it has not yet arrived ... It seems overwhelming, painful, horrible and expands the imagination in more than one way. In short, I waited for this damn DVD forever ... the first edition of the DVD was slop and came out of print so fast, I was lucky to find a copy of video rental for rent.No addition to this ... but this is the only one to own.'",1
"b'About the only thing wrong with this image is the title. Adapted from the novel ""Red Dragon"" by Thomas Harris, it was decided to change the title. Probably thinking that most American movie goers would think it\'s a Kung Fu movie or something. Probably right. This is also prior to the most acclaimed sequel ""The Silence of the Innocents,"" by the same author. It\'s another great Michael Mann movie, with style and substance. Style can bother some people. It is filmed with various unnatural tones including violet, blue and green. Although they may not be realistic, they always seem to fit the scene. Mann and his photographer put cameras in interesting places. Take for example the austere white cell of Hannibal Lector (Brian Cox). We see both Reader and Will Graham (William Petersen) centered between the same 2 bars, with quick cuts back and forth. Another camera sits above the room. This movie is not really about Dr. Lector however. It\'s about a serial killer known as The Tooth Fairy (Thomas Noonan - really scary). While Petersen struggles with his own sanity, he marries the killer using his ability to enter the killer\'s head. He stole this theme for his TV series ""Miami Vice"" about the same time. Another great tactic for which Mann is known is the use of music. Here we have an original soundtrack from The Reds and Michel Rubini, not to mention the incredibly cool climactic scene with Iron Butterfly\'s In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.'",1
"b""Once upon a blue moon, there arises a pleasure for all that uplifts the spirit. `` Strictly Ballroom '' is one of those films. Directed in a delightful high-key style by Baz Luhrmann (WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S ROMEO + JULIET, MOULIN ROUGE) in his crazy debut (the first in what would be called Red Curtain Trilogy), the film tells the story of a ballroom dancer who joins an ugly duckling, left-footed, when his independent style gives him the contempt of his more conventional-minded colleagues. Together, they give their all and aim to make the dreams of the National Championship title come true. To say that this movie is incredible would be a euphemism. It is one of the most gloriously entertaining and inspiring films of all time. The cast is simply magnificent and Luhrmann presents his style of direction and editing smart and fast here. He brilliantly uses an opening documentary style and occasional interludes that help better understand the adorable characters. This works wonderfully! This is definitely the feel-good movie of the decade. It's hypnotic, strange, and deeply heartfelt - a delightful delight for the public. A highly recommended must!""",1
"b""I love the first two Anne of Green Gables movies. I saw them for the first time on PBS and had the original VHS tapes released by Disney. Sullivan's first DVD releases had a very low visual and audio quality. This new set - expensive - brings together the four films together, all in widescreen 16x9. I do not like the other two movies, so I'll just comment on the first two. They were originally filmed in 4x3 format, with the television in mind (I read that they may have touched the outside). I'm not an expert, but these new widescreen formats look cropped. Thus, information is lost with these new transfers. Is that so bad? Yes, because I feel that the original proportions of these films should be 4x3 (or 1.33: 1), as they were originally transmitted. Even worse, the image quality looks so digitally erased that many details that were originally visible are no longer visible. The audio looks OK; the default is the original stereo 2.0 mix. Annoyingly, closed captioning seems to have been done by imbeciles. For the first movie, the first disc (fortunately, each movie has two discs) has fairly good subtitles. The second disc has the caption all in IN CHALL CAPS and is full of errors. Very poor quality! ! At this price point, I would not recommend the fans to repurchase these movies if they were already owned. However, as an FYI, I contacted Sullivan Entertainment and they said they have no plans to release the movies on blu-ray.""",0

"b'A sequel to director Ridley Scott\'s ""Alien"" was inevitable, of course. This traditional horror film set in space simply earned a lot of money for the studio to simply leave it alone. Surprisingly, when director James Cameron took over, he was determined to make a different film rather than just redo the first one. Thus, ""Aliens"" was adventurous, taking the story in new and exciting directions as a thread of action and adventure rather than another horror film. In fact, several critics think ""Aliens"" is better than ""Alien"". `` But now it comes `` `Alien 3` `- as an unnecessary sequence to a great movie as we have seen in a while. First director David Fincher and four writers have created another horror film, trying on existential tones while creating the alien in this movie, Moby Dick, by Ripley. `` But `` Alien 3 `` starts altering the ending of its predecessor and knocking down almost all the characters we care about. Fans will remember that Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Hicks, Newt and the android bishop escaped in a spaceship at the end of ""Aliens"". \'\' But this movie begins with its expulsion from the ship and the forced landing on a planet-prison, which kills them all except Ripley! Ripley discovers that the only surviving monster is still with them. Soon, she\'s organizing the prisoners to be alert, but since there are no weapons of any kind all over the planet, they end up playing hide and seek with the creature for most of the film. of problems with this movie, but the worst is his somber dark motive; lack of friendly characters; the dislike of the premise of the film, which has Ripley eventually discovering that she has an alien queen growing inside her; and a long sequence of persecutions so obscure and edited so chaotically that it becomes confused. Those looking for thrills or some enhancement in the early films will be disappointed. Those who seek a headache will have come to the right place. And why is ""Alien 3"" (rather than simply ""Alien 3"" or ""Alienz"" or ""Alien: One of These Drooling Monsters Survived After All""? It\'s probably just a trick to getting writers like me to ponder the issue and give the film a little more paint. ""It worked.'",0
"b'As some reviews show, if you love this movie, you\'ll love it; if you detest it, you * will * really hate it. Since I\'ve seen it twice, and I\'m ready to see it again, you can put me firmly into the first category - I have not been so transported and moved by a movie since ""The Fountain"". (which evoked similar responses of love or hate to viewers). This requires the voluntary suspension of cynicism, which I suspect is a point of contention for some ... but if you are willing to open your mind, and your heart even more, you will be amply rewarded. simple, as it should be: a thread that goes through the lives of several characters, which brings them to the main events of the 1960s. Wealth comes in the evocation of the times, in the countless little details revolving around the characters. And most important, when all is said and done, this is a love story, beautifully and poignantly told. If you have felt the intense emotions expressed in these beautiful songs then you will identify with Jude & Lucy, Sadie & JoJo and all your friends. Not only romantic love but also genuine love for others as brothers and sisters, we all together in this confusing and stimulating world. ""Are there any weird moments or scenes a little too precious for contemporary tastes?"" Of course ! But that does not really matter, because one of the characteristics of the 1960s was the willingness to take ridiculous risks, risking looking foolish or even falling face to face. I\'m glad that Julie Taymor has taken similar risks here because it helps capture the sensitivity of the time, a sensitivity that has led to tremendous creativity and innovation. And it\'s not just this time. The questions of unnecessary war, the demonization of the Other, of intolerance and fear of change, of mistrust of the imagination - are not as potent today as they have always been? But while the film is definitely on the side of the counterculture at its best, Julie Taymor does not hesitate to show how even the best idealistic intentions can get in dark places, as with some demonstrators moving to the bombs. A hymn of peace and love, is also well acquainted with grief and despair. Certainly, the film ends with the anthem, ""All You Need Is Love,"" a song that was rejected by some as an irredeemably naive & dated flower power artifact. But I remember something George Harrison once said, when he was asked if love really * is * all you need - he replied that even if it is not * everything * you need, if you do not have it then how good it is the rest? Yes, it is a bright cloud of sunlit nostalgia in a sense ... but it is also a reminder that there is more to life than fear and darkness, that there is hope even in the midst of madness and chaos. And in that sense, it\'s a very contemporary film with a vital message. Higher, happily recommended!'",1
"b'I was disappointed to receive this movie for the price. However, I was pleased with the shipping. I strongly recommend someone tempted to buy this to save your money and rent it or try to get it really cheap. The movie was not what I expected it to be.'",0
"b""This film was generally neglected after the release. Predating Lone Star and Thunderheart, this movie has three amazing things: (1) the cast is stellar. You get Dafoe in a role of good man, M Emmett Walsh as a lazy coroner, Mary Elizabeth Mastronantino in an amazing lead role, Sam Jackson (as he is listed in the final credits) ripping the scenery, Mickey Roarke in a GOOD performance , and even an ungrateful paper without credits. (2) The plot is way better than the No Way Out. With Donaldson driving, you may think it would just be a remake / remuddle, but the plot continues to get distorted, and once you think it's remotely discovered, BANG another thing happens. (3) the setting is amazing. The only film that comes closest to capturing the feel of New Mexico's landscape is Backtrack, which is also very good. The widescreen adds (though it's fair to ask WHEN DOES NOT DO ANYTHING), so if you were like me and did not see it until it was released on VHS, you're a treat. Not everything works - you're still waiting for Dafoe to become the idiot he is in most of his films since Wild at Heart, or Roarke to make little sense, but like Angelheart, he's focused and amazing here, but it does not. Not a lot of extras here, unfortunately (maybe there's an edit from the director somewhere with more than Mimi Rogers, but as it stands, this is a great movie. Four out of five stars.""",1

"b""Okay, you would think this is common knowledge, but apparently not as common as we all realize. 'Starboard' is right. 'Port' is left. It is obvious from the direction of the helmsman that the director, producers, cast and crew of the film are all a bunch of troublemakers who deserve to get off with the boat. This is not the only mistake in the film, nor the most obvious one. There are many other problems in this production that have already been discussed - the fact that you know what will happen before you begin, the crew shooting passengers, the duration of the film, Leonardo DiCaprio - to name a few. While each one is not overly disturbing, they make the movie a bit disgusting for those who do not like to read 24-7 novels. Even with this end, the novel is stupid (for lack of my effort to find a better description). The only saving grace of any case is the whole, which is simply spectacular. They spared no expense in building the ship's replica, and this shows. Two stars for the sets and nothing else.""",0
"b'A story within a story on a cruise ship - the superficial history is of a ""seven-year itch"". A respectable, childless British couple celebrating this volunteer anniversary is unabashedly warned (in relation to her husband, anyway) by an Indian sage that children are better marital therapy than a cruise to India. Lust takes over the seemingly conservative Brit played perfectly by Hugh Grant and makes him a fool. Yes, this happens to men all the time. On this cruise, the British couple find the sexy French siren and her crippled, older, infectious husband who clings to her British husband to tell his autobiographical novel published in his book. And as for the writer\'s inner story and his French obsession, this shows how ""greed"" for hedonistic fantasy can lead to obscure, sadistic, or at least lamentable behavior. Suffice it to say that everyone learns this lesson in their own way in the end. A subtle theme here is the portrait of the unsuccessful writer, who buys fantasy with great force and tries to make life imitate art until his life and his art fall short of expectations. any success, (like lust in the seven-year male itch, is another truism - failed artists often go far into fantasy, giving up the realism that ultimately causes frustration and failure) story orally to a mere idiot on a cruise that completely loses its point and is ready to profit from his perfectly respectable life by a brief and scandalous state of sadness, just as he has made the cripple a detestable and abominable loser. Much like the Siren song by Homer (who was also cruising the Mediteranian, was not he?) Great score by Vangelis too, capturing romance and tragedy on a theme.'",1

"b""This review is just about blu-ray, since there are many reviews here in the movie itself and there are only so many ways to say that the movie is great. I was a bit skeptical about this blu-ray because I had read that it was not a big update on the Jane Doe issue. Technically, this may be true, but the truth is this is the best Fletch has ever seen and may be the best he's ever gotten. I do not know if they can invent a format that can breathe a lot of life into a mid-1980s comedy that was not originally planned / budgeted to be a visual spectacle. Yes, this movie does not look like The Departed on Blu-ray, but it's an improvement over the DVD and that's all you can ask for. For $ 10, it's hard to beat and for me it's obvious if you're a fan of the movie.""",1
"b""I would recommend this movie to adults and kids alike. It has something of interest for all age groups. There are beautiful landscapes inspired by the southwest, as the story takes place in the desert of southwestern Arizona in Navajo lands. There is a story too, of two young men who have lost their goat, and they think she wandered into a gorge known as & quot; Cougar Canyon & quot; a place that should be haunted, according to the Navajo legend. They must go in to find the goat, of course, and are surrounded by many dangerous mishaps before successfully fulfilling their mission. The true stars of this film, however, beyond the beautiful landscape, is the superb wildlife photography of the desert in its natural habitat. There is a battle between a badger and a puma, or wild cat, as it is most commonly known, with a surprise ending. The close-ups of a diamond rattlesnake are incredible, and the narration is superb, too. This movie is reminiscent of the old Disney Nature Documentary series that used to appear on television years ago in the 1970s. I enjoyed it immensely, and I am an old citizen, but I can see where it would attract kids too, as they are usually fascinated with wild creatures such as rattle snakes, wild cats, black bears, etc. in their natural environment. In fact, it is very educational, especially for us city dwellers. I can not say enough good things about this movie, you'll just have to see it for yourself.""",1
"b'The reviewer who has the right to die on these pages is what draws attention to the fact that Jonathan Larson conceived ""Rent"" as more opera (using ""La Boheme"" as inspiration), not a musical. And what that means is that the connection dialogue is sung in a stage voice, not conversationally as dialogue. So to see Jesse L. Martin forced to speak in dialogue as `` I re-plugged the ATM into the Food Emporium \'\' when you know you\'re killing him to not sing and it\'s equally killing all of Rent\'s fans to hear It\'s just embarrassing to say the words ... well, it\'s a big flaw, because it causes big bumps in the flow and energy of Larson\'s work. Other concerns: * The first half of the play is replaced practically by shooting. Then, bizarrely (given the fidelity in the first time), the second half deviates from the original. Director Columbus wastes a lot of time staging ""Take Me or Leave Me"" in a way that is not intentional. Fun, no doubt, but the additional 5 to 10 minutes he ventures here could have been used to keep the deleted scenes intact. * Deleted scenes are not trivial - \'Rent\' is a difficult story to follow for the unitiated. Each of these scenes could have helped explain the plot. Certainly one of the reasons for holding ""Take Me or Leave Me"" was to get more Idina Menzel there. [Menzel (the original Elephaba in \'Wicked\' and the original Maureen here) ascended to the royalty of Broadway, so who can blame Colombo? ] But if so, why leave out \'Happy New Year? \'which presents a good amount of Maureen? * The deleted scenes end up not emphasizing Anthony Rapp\'s brand, which is a shame because he is the voice and the connecting thread in the play. Leave out your \'3D IMAX from my mind ... that\'s poetic ... that\'s pathetic\' number is a big omission, both for Rapp as an actor and for anyone trying to follow the movie - this is the key piece that puts things in perspective for the viewer in time. Why else would Larson struggle to put lines in Rapp\'s monologue as ""Christmas ... Christmas Eve last year? \'\' He\'s framing the scenes for us. This would be a three-star review, but I\'m going to four because of the redeeming nature of the good Larson family documentary - that\'s a very powerful thing. It is obvious that the family is still suffering deeply 10 years after their loss.'",1

"b'This is a 1970s horror movie based on the bestselling book of the ""true"" story of a haunted house on Long Island. It was denied and proved to be a total farce, but the film spawned about ten sequels and even that necessary remake. The Lutz family buys the house of their dreams only to discover it is haunted, and also contains the passage to hell in the basement. Yes, it is completely and utterly overwhelming to think that if such a passage existed in something called Hell, it would be in Amityville, Long Island. James Brolin plays the husband, tough guy with lots of hair. Margot Kidder is the wife, who can react with big, wide eyes whenever she witnesses a ghost, hallucination, atrocities, etc. Most of the scares are really opening doors or something, looking at something, and then the music gets really loud, and then we see people\'s eyes, closer, and then, da da!

"b""I do not like this movie. It deserves 5 stars for outstanding acting, a horrifying and moving story based on true accounts, dark scenarios and photography, and a mood steeped in despair. A German journalist, Nina Hoss as the mermaid with dark eyes, beaten, unintentional, remains behind in Berlin to document the invasion of the Russians (Soviets). Soon, she finds herself involved in the rape and destruction of the city, and they are defenseless civilians. After repeated attacks against herself, in desperation, she seeks a protector and meets a mysterious Russian officer (Evgeny Sidikhin) with a haunted past. Interested in it, but a bit reluctant, he agrees, and what follows becomes a tale of relationships and commonalities in the midst of hell on earth. Without wishing to justify them, writers to some extent show both sides of the conflict. Russians, in general, yearn for their families, hate the war that dragged them there, and report terrible memories of the atrocities committed by the Germans in their homeland. Paying evil for evil does not settle your actions at all, but I suppose this brings some sort of balance and understanding to the story. Fortunately, the robberies are shown non-gratuitously, and there is a nudity scene to make a point, but this is for graphic footage. But one gets the message. The whole movie is depressing. I think the only sense of hope provided comes from the heroine's desire to survive, to maintain her sanity, and a sense of decency, no matter what. The written epilogue is almost as disturbing. The response of societies is to hide the past instead of dealing with it. A difficult film. I do not watch again.""",1

"b""I could be lyrical about this movie forever, but I will not! In my opinion, the biggest music film ever produced, 'The Music Man', is what I've heard in my native England. I picked it up when it was shown on TV in the early hours of the morning, about 15 years ago, and I've loved it ever since. Robert Preston It is Harold Hill and proves that he is a fantastic movie actor whose film credits are depressingly few - although if you have not seen it, check out Victor / Victoria. Shirley Jones does a performance that, after 'Oklahoma! 'and' carousel 'shows that she can act! All supporting players are excellent as well, with an emphasis on Paul Ford and Hermione Gingold (again very few movie appearances) such as the Shinns, Pert Kelton as Mrs. Paroo and The Buffalo Bills as the All-Singing All-Harmonizing School Board . much better as a movie than a spectacle, Meredith Willson's ode to her childhood in Iowa is perfectly captured by Morton DaCosta, whose direction is as atypical as in Aunt Mame, but which fits very well with the slightly unreal nature of the plot. The musical highlights are practically every song, but a short list would include 'Trouble', '76 Trombones', 'Marian the Librarian' and 'The Sadder But Wiser Girl'.""",1

"b'`` 28 Days Later \'\' is easily the best horror movie I\'ve seen in a long time. What struck me most was how clever it was; that is, the suspension of disbelief was very manageable. Once I got the idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8ba virus affecting someone that way and spreading so quickly, the rest of the plot made perfect sense to me. The few questions I had were easily informed about a beer with my friends. When I heard they were making a sequel, I got really excited and really set my timeline. Opening night, first showing after I left work I was there. Three hours later, I was banging my head on the table and wondering if there was enough beer in the world to understand what I had just seen. ""28 Weeks Later"" should become a case study in film schools on how to take all that is good about an incredible movie and set it aside for sequel. As mentioned in some other reviews, the plot holes are huge and relentless. My favorites are: 1) the children simply leave the security zone and we even see soldiers in the watchtower just let them go, 2) no one is monitoring or keeping the survivor infected (but not symptomatic), 3) the husband she is dumb enough to kiss her, and 4) no matter how many blocks of the city the boy is frantically impelled, his father ""roars"" appears quickly and concentrates on attacking him and only him. I was especially eager to see the virus spreading through a crowd, as was reported in the first movie. Do not . When it hits the fan at the train station, what happens? The lights go out and we are given a lot of quick and strobe pictures. Wow, thanks. Unless you\'re epileptic, there\'s nothing scary about it. I give it two stars mainly because I can not give \'Days\'\' seven. Well, let\'s call one for the opening sequence and one for the ending. If it were not for the promise of seeing France get it in the next film, this movie would have totally diverted me to any future ""Anything 28"".'",0

I'm looking forward, now, to see the sequel `` Underworld Evolution ''. If you get only one science fiction / horror movie on Blu-Ray Give this movie a serious consideration.

But it would take much better writing and character development to do this in the futile farce that strives so hard to be. Good attempt though, and there are rewards.

"b""Based on a true story, Nigel Cole's CALENDAR GIRLS is a capricious, touching, but sometimes trivial movie. Trivial only in that there are many moments when nothing of real importance happens, and the crisis points are predictably mushy and exaggerated. But a charming cast still manages to entertain. The idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bmore than 50 natural women is difficult to understand, but these women are so elegant and attractive, and the calendar becomes so well done that it can not be avoided when the calendar becomes an international success. Helen Mirren, long-awaited an Oscar, brings her role as Chris, the instigator of the calendar, to a wonderful enjoyment. Ciaran Hinds (Sum of All Fears, Cradle of Life by Lara Croft) is very good, as her husband, whose farewell letter to a sneaky newsboy, causes a breakup in marriage. Julie Walters (Oscar-nominated for years by Educating Rita) does the same with Mirren in her role of widow whose death of the husband inspires the calendar. The other ladies, Annette Crosbie and Penelope Wilton especially, are all very talented in their performances. It's not a shake-earth movie, but an uplifting one in that it proves that beauty is not relegated to the young, perhaps the young at heart .""",1
"b""Before I saw The Girl Next Door, I hoped it was a typical teen sex movie. After watching it, it became one of my favorite movies, if not my favorite. It's a love story and a comedy in just one. Emile Hirsch plays Matthew Kidman, a high school student who is a great student and good kid, but he's kind of nerdy and did not do anything memorable all through high school. This changes when he meets his new neighbor Danielle, played by Elisha Cuthbert. Danielle is beautiful and Matthew instantly falls in love with her. Shortly after sighting her, he sees her undressing by the window and can not help but watch. Danielle catches him watching her and gets angry at first, but then it seems she fell in love with him too. Danielle is a former porn star, whom Matthew does not discover until her friend Eli (played by Chris Marquette) shows her a video of her. To further complicate matters, Danielle's former producer / ex-boyfriend Kelly (played by Timothy Olyphant) appears one day and wants Danielle to return to the adult film market. Kelly and Matthew get on well at first, but that changes when Matthew tries to get Danielle out of the porn industry, which Kelly does not like at all. Eli and Kelly are two characters who really steal the show in this movie. Eli is the nerdy friend of Matthew who gets excited all the time and obsessed with sex and hot women. He had some of the funniest lines in the whole movie. Kelly (the porn director who used to work with Danielle and also used to hang out with her) is the cool, smart guy who caught me in almost every scene he was in. I could not decide whether to love him or hate him - he's a nice and funny guy when he and Matthew are friends, but when Matthew makes him angry, he becomes psychotic and violent. I do not want to give up too much. in this movie, but Danielle makes Matthew do things he never imagined he would do. It really is a case of attraction of opposites: Matthew falls in love with the wild adventurous side of Danielle, and Danielle falls in love with the innocence and purity of Matthew. In several scenes, you can say that Danielle really is a good person, she does not really want to be in the porn business, and she really cares about Matthew. Matthew feels the same about Danielle and puts himself in many risk situations for her. This movie was so touching that I cried in parts, and I do not cry easily. However, there were also such funny parts that I could not stop laughing (especially the scenes with Eli and Kelly). Definitely worth watching and underrated.""",1
"b'I do not understand why other countries have all 4 seasons available and the United States does not. This is a great show and should be available here. I have most shows recorded on TV, but I would love to have a box set from this show.'",0
"b""This is still one of my favorite shows to date. I really enjoy reviewing the episodes over and over again. This is the second last season and is one of the best seasons. Obviously, over the years, children are growing and maturing and this brings some interesting situations. In the episode Fast Friends, Steph goes out with children who smoke and make her feel pressured to do the same. I also like the apartment where Steve buys an apartment and DJ sleeps on the couch. Danny finds her (after she arrives late at home) and gets very angry. Full House is a great show that I'm sure today's kids would still like, and older kids like me still like it because I grew up watching it. There's never been a cooler guy (or cuter) than Uncle Jesse, and the love between the whole family is great and fun to watch. This is one of the best seasons and any fan should definitely have this in their collection.""",1
"b""You think Hollywood would have no problem making a movie about Hollywood. Think again. It's true there have been some great photos that Hollywood looks at. The oldest I can think of is A Star is Born, 1937, which was remade as an even better film in 1954. 1950 Sunset Boulevard is one of the biggest movies ever made, and a few years later came Singin 'in the Rain, a classical music. However, over the years, the industry has produced more bad films about itself than the good ones. America's Boyfriends are somewhere in between. Its beginning is quite promising, but it hesitates and descends the hill after that. Lee [Billy Crystal] is a Hollywood press agent with big problems. His boss, Dave [Stanley Tucci], needs him to promote the newest movie starring Gwen Harrison and Eddie Thomas [Catherine Zeta-Jones and John Cusack]. The duo used to be the most popular and most popular couple in the United States, and audiences gathered to watch their films. Now that they are on the verge of divorce and can not see each other, they are mailbox poison. Lee must figure out a way to convince the press that Gwen and Eddie are coming back together without letting the two stars know what he's doing. He asks for the help of Gwen's sister, Kiki [Julia Roberts], who not only resents the way Gwen orders her, but is also secretly in love with Eddie. Then there is the problem of the film itself. All the studio saw were the opening credits. Director [Christopher Walken] does not want to show it until he has made some changes. These changes will result in a film quite different from the one the studio paid $ 86 million to make. Reading the above synopsis makes me see just how funny and insightful American boyfriends could have been. The plot leaves ample space for farce and satire, but the writers did not seize the opportunity. Instead of being bright, fragile and insightful, the story is cute, cloying and meek. Most of Hollywood's chances of laughing at herself are wasted. This is Julia Roberts. As much as I've finally come to respect her, I do not think she's right in a normal role. In addition, she made the ugly duckling into a swan routine many times before. The film is basically a vanity project for Billy Crystal, which he also produced, and for director Joe Roth, who used it to launch his new company, Revolution Studios. They were probably afraid of upsetting the Hollywood establishment, of which they are part. If your mind wanders while watching a movie, it usually means that you are not catching you. There are several scenes in America's Sweethearts, where a character says something and everyone in the room chokes. I started to think about it. In all my life, I've never seen anyone say anything that would make all the listeners choke, and I've met some very bold people. This is something that happens only in movies. So I started listing in my head other things you see only on the celluloid. Before I knew it, the movie was over.""",0
"b""The hostel garnered much controversy after the release, and spawned a generally uncomfortable set of public reactions. Many responded with hatred of the violent and inflexible nature of the film. My problem with this is not violence. I can not connect to the first half of the movie, which is about regular male fool behavior while traveling through central Europe. All this becomes a long wait to see what you expect in the second half, and provides very little development for what we will eventually have to endure. All the violence in the film is hard, personal and disturbing. It's not fun, but in a broader, very interesting sense. It makes you think about the world, and what dark places can exist where anything or anyone can be bought for the right price. This DVD contains some very good features, and in general a very good set of extras, including a featurette that is almost entirely about the inspiration and reaction of the movie, and how much of it is based on reality. Eli Roth is certainly a smart man, and he's off to tell a message, not just shock, but due to the hard and hard nature of the film, it's hard to digest, and it's too uncomfortable to be really memorable. Maybe there's a bit too much truth for the Hostel.""",0
"b'TETSUJIN 28 is a Japanese live-action film based on the Mitsuteru Yokoyama manga series, best known in the West for its 1963 animated black-and-white adaptation, which was aired on US television in 1966 under the title "" Gigantor "". ""There are some pretty spectacular scenes here of two giant robots, Tetsujin 28 and Black Ox, walking the streets of Tokyo and making a scratch on their horizon, including a harrowing movement where Black Ox lowers at the top of the Tokyo Tower. There is even a great deal where Black Ox launches Tetsujin with disabilities in the Diet Building (Parliament). These sequences are quite exciting and well made, as if the cameras were on the scene and captured the action as it unfolded. Unfortunately, the two subsequent robot battles do not deliver the goods. The punches are very weak and there is not much movement in the fights. Robots never fly and fight each other in the air, although in the final encounter, both really have that power. The original animated series had a much more satisfying giant robot action than the one we have here. Worse still, the young Shotaro, who was assigned to operate the remote device that controls Tetsujin, never seems to want to do so. He is weak and scared for most of the movie. When he finally reaches the plate and accepts his role at the 90-minute mark - long for us to have to wait - he is not particularly effective. While the boy playing Shotaro may be offering a realistic picture of how a ten-year-old would react under the circumstances, I must confess that I was not exactly looking for realism. I wanted the boy to be anxious all the time to control that mighty robot and send him into a furious fight to end Black Ox\'s depredations. Just like Shotaro (or ""Jimmy Sparks,"" as he was known in Gigantor) behaved in the original manga and anime. Or the male heroes in ""Johnny Sokko and his flying robot"" and the 1960s Gamera movies. These new Japanese heroes are really weak when put to the test (see also Toru in GAMERA THE BRAVE and Tadashi in THE GREAT YOKAI WAR, two films also made in 2005, and both were also reviewed on this site). What does this say about the next generation of Japanese heroes? At least \'Ash\' Pok & mon still knows what to do in the face of a threat. I did as an aspect of the movie, though. I enjoyed seeing two idols of Japanese pop music in the cast. The oldest is Hiroko Yakushimaru, who was popular in the 1980s and starred in a movie I remember called SAILOR SUIT AND MACHINE GUN (1981). She plays Shotaro\'s mother and she is very beautiful. The other is one of my all-time favorite J-pop singers, Yuko Nakazawa, one of the founding members of Morning Musume, here playing a young police detective assigned to the case. They give her short, dark hair and a pretty simple navy blue suit, clearly an attempt to minimize her usual glamor, but she has a lot to do and it\'s always thrilling to see her in action. Another key female character is Mami Tachibana (played by Yu Aoi), an MIT robotics expert recruited to help reform Tetsujin 28 after a disastrous battle from the start. She is young and brave and looks sharp in a uniform and beret as she befriends the young Shotaro. Akira Senju\'s score is nice and melodic and keeps things optimistic when the movie slows down (which it often does). I also have the soundtrack CD. The final song follows a replay of the male chorus singing the theme ""Tetsujin 28"" from 1963, accompanied by scenes from the original manga, which seems much more action-packed than anything in this film. The Pioneer / Geneon DVD does not offer credits in English anywhere except the one in the DVD case.'",0

Why was Cornelius arrested? Was your godfather a good character or a bad one? 2) Graphics are primitive and very scary. The eight-year-old girl who saw her to the end (she always does, no matter what!) Was often distracted and her five-year-old brother was bored and left the room before the scary parties forced us to turn off the tape. 3) Attempts to make the story appealing to children by adding animal characters further confuse the plot and make the story unrecognizable to anyone who, like me, has read and appreciated the book.

"b""This was a very interesting film. In fact, it is not banned in Singapore. I saw this movie while living there and it was a great relief. Although the film focuses on street goons, the general theme is Singapore's forgotten people, who can not be a doctor, lawyer or compadre (government). Students are simplified at a very young age and some bad tests mean that you are involved with scum. This movie shows what is happening in Singapore on a side that many Sinagporeans are unaware of. 5 stars for boldness. The cinematography is hard (choppy) in the pieces and the story jumps a little ... but it is still very convincing.""",1
"b'If you liked the first, this is your alley. I say this mainly because the tone (darker than many conventional films), the hidden nature and unusual pictures tend to leave some moviegoers off. But if you simply want to see a movie about a demon that was created by humans to fight evil, this is a great movie for you. Guillermo del Toro\'s driving style is very kinetic and fluent. This helps keep the movie going, keeping it from creeping. The scenes flow very well from one to the next (which is also done very well with some wipes and creative overlays). The real attraction for this movie, however, is Hellboy and the staff that was provided to him. Ron Perlman is the absolutely perfect Hellboy. His delivery of the lines is nothing short of perfect in creating a bitter character, but in the end adorable (and also loving). He has an ironic humor about him that makes the character Hellboy something we can all relate to. We all had times when we felt underestimated. We all feel like the outsider outsider. However, despite all the incentives he has to give up defending these humans, he continues to do so because that is what his father taught him to do. Of course Abe and Liz are here too, and Doug Jones and Selma Blair do a wonderful job of portraying their respective characters. But this is not their movie. It is interesting, however, to see one of the elements of the story of the first film turned to portray the other side of it when the team meets the angel of death. In short, as I said above, if you liked the first one, this is just your type of movie. I look forward to seeing what del del Toro has in mind for the third movie. (Of course, we\'ll have to wait for him to finish ""The Hobbit"" first).'",1
"b'Former government agent Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) must solve the mystery behind events that happened when he was a child, in order to save the planet from being destroyed by monsters of another dimension.OK, I admit, ""Alone in the Dark ""is not on my list of best movies of all time, but it\'s not on my list of movies either. It may be directed by Uwe Boll, who is considered by many to be the worst director of all time, but if all of Boll\'s other films are so, then Boll has been grossly underestimated because I have seen many movies. which are much worse than this (for example, ""The remake of Stepford Wives""). The script is based on a videogame, which gives you that ""video game"", moving from level to level, I feel that you started with many such movies (like ""Resident Evil"" or ""Doom""), but that did not deter me both of the film made me want to go out and play the game. Not being a player, this was my first encounter with ""Alone in the Dark"", and I found the story interesting enough to keep my interest in the length of the movie. The performance is uneven in quality. Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff (as another government agent) both perform in decent performances, but Tara Reid is as unconvincing as a scientist that she really contributes to the movie\'s entertainment value. My main criticism is that some of the battle scenes are very long. There is a fight scene at the 1 hour mark which comprises about 15 minutes of people shooting at monsters with very little dialogue, which became tedious after a while. Despite this, I still liked the movie and would be prepared to watch it again.'",0
"b""I will post this comment in English and Spanish. Well, I do not know if my expectations were too high for this, but I think the quality of the video and the vocals is not worth anything. The video is sometimes not related to the lyrics of sonng. Another thing that bothered me a lot is that all the songs have the vocals attached to them, and the singer is not good, nor does she keep the same rhythm as Lavoe, making this DVD useless for my needs. I wanted to sing along the soundtrack, I do not accompany a bad singer. Well, the truth I feel disappointed with this karaoke DVD, since it is the first that all songs are played by a singer in a trial is not very good and desvirt & uacute; a lot of the entonaci? n rhythm of some of the songs. I think that if I buy a karaoke CD it's to sing the letter myself? On the other hand, the videos that accompany you, to the songs I notice them something amateur and sometimes they do not even have relation with what it is singing The The only thing I needed was a CD with a clue and the lyrics of each song. n (I think not even the lyrics since I'm a fan of Lavoe and I get almost all of them) so he was totally disappointed with my purchase.

The animated version of I Stink is a hit almost as big with my son as the book. The DVD also includes some other animated adaptations that (more or less) carry the theme of the garbage truck. Trashy Town is the only other story on the subject of trash on the DVD, but with its simple animation and captivating ""chorus"", it went very well. The others are wrong. Arnie the Donut was funny and a little disturbing (it\'s about a sentient mass conscious of his impending death), but Monsieur Racine\'s Beast was a little too strange.

"b'While for me ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" remains the best Masterpiece Theater series of all time, this is a close second. Gemma Jones is superb as Louisa Trotter, the Cockney Cook / Hotelier who never loses her manners of common sense nor her strong cockney accent, even after becoming host to the rich and famous Edwardian England. Earlier episodes focus on the rise of Louisa from an assistant cook to lover of the Prince of Wales (later, King Edward VII). But most of the series concerns the activities of the Bentinck Hotel, an exclusive and private London property owned and operated by Louisa. With few exceptions, someone\'s family may have been listed in the Debrett Partnership for at least 100 years before anyone can book a room at Bentinck. And yet, Louisa\'s selectivity is not so much a reflection of her snobbery, but of her passionate commitment to be the Best in everything she does. The entire series is rich in characters and incidents, and in fact Jones / Louisa is deep down in several episodes. But she is unquestionably the dominant and dominant character in this series. You have not seen the unbridled Jura Indignation until you see Louisa, in the last episode of this collection, witnessing at the trial on behalf of her friend, Lord Haslemere, pouring diatribe after diatribe in all its cockney glory.

"b'Arguably, this is the funniest of the holiday movies. The real test of a good comedy is to be able to keep yelling at the movie years later, and ""Christmas holidays"" more than that for me. But this works the other way around: instead of the disaster-prone Griswolds traveling abroad to places like Europe or Wally World, they are anchored in front of the house, while the calendar marks the days until Christmas. Chevy Chase is clearly in its element here reprizing its role as the well-meaning but desperately matriarch Clark, who naturally goes overboard with the creation of ""Perfect Christmas."" The dependable good Beverly D\'Angelo is also here as Clark\'s supporting wife, who gets her buttons pushed by annoying relatives and crying kids, as well as her willful husband. The late John Hughes fills the script of satires and references, punched with the trademark `` Lampoon \'\' slapstick & lowbrow humor. Granted, sometimes the mood tanks, but it is a nobler effort than the previous uneven `` European Vacation \'\'.

"b'After reading the wonderful `` Doc \'\' book for the book club, my husband and I watched `` Tombstone \'\' a few days ago, and `` Wyatt Earp \'\' last night in preparation for next week\'s meeting of the book club. For all those who say there is some controversy about which movie is best, I can put the controversy to rest: `` Tombstone \'\' is better. Watching `` Wyatt Earp \'\' seemed to attend a community theater (with no offense to the community theater)) of the opening scenes with Wyatt (Kevin Costner, with his anachronistic hairstyle), drinking a cup of coffee that is boiling like a witch\'s cauldron, as if the helpers put a piece of dry ice in the cup. With the exception of the good Gene Hackman as Earp\'s father, the male actors\' performance is either caricature, or melodramatic, or wood, or incredibly, all three at the same time. Having just watched Wyatt Earp\'s tightly controlled, uber-masculine portrait of Kevin Costner\'s ""Tombstone,"" Kevin Costner played the same character and reminded me a bit of Forrest Gump, without offending Forrest Gump, crossed with Costner. of ""Dances With Wolves"" (even hairstyle). I love Dennis Quaid, but having watched Doc Holliday\'s definitive portrait of Val Kilmer in ""Tombstone"" a few days before seeing Quaid\'s version on ""Wyatt Earp"" was probably unfair to Dennis Quaid and his cool sunglasses, which They did not even come near me. I love the western movies, but this clich\xc3\xa9 movie - a dose of bottle well before a bullet. explodes, anyone? It made me roll my eyes. To sweeten the deal, it\'s over three hours!

"b'Having played both games ""BloodRayne"", I\'m a fan of the series. So when I heard they were making a movie, I was a little interested. But deep down, I knew it would probably suck. I was more than right. Unless you\'re interested in a girl who is so terrible that makes you laugh, DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE! It\'s a total disaster! The film Rayne is nothing like its equivalent in the video game. The fight scenes were slow, nothing like the fluidity of the game. And do not get me started on the blood ... I\'ve seen better settings in a haunted house. Nothing was done realistically, and the ten-minute recap at the end of the movie (which was made for some reason I\'ll never understand) just shows how sloppy it is. The performance was not great either, and the short sex scene ... let\'s just say I\'ve been laughing for most of this mess. No need for day, the plot was also missing (and this is putting everything lightly). If you want a vampire movie, choose the ""Underworld"" movies.

"b'Italian Job is the best film of all time, without a doubt. Usually I agree with Leonard Maltin, but sometimes he is off the scale and he certainly is in this case. Okay, you may think the characterization is bad - but they are stereotypes. This movie was ironic even before Kevin Williamson and his kind were born. It is worth knowing that the British censors in 1968 would not allow any film to be released, which made it appear that the crime paid, so the end was linked to that condition.

Moving quickly, perfectly intertwined subplots, flaring brilliant, all in all superb. I left the movie having laughed at myself stupid while at the same time having enjoyed a plot that was simple to follow but complex in makeup. Guy Ritchie did a great job on this, the cast was superbly chosen, even Brad Pitt, who, so far, has not been one of my favorites. I also bought the DVD, two albums, masses of extras, watched four times, I can not watch again, my ribs can not stand the blows they make. I recommend this to everyone.

"b""As a lover of ancient history, I was excited to watch yet another movie about Cleopatra's life. This film is extremely fascinating, and seems to follow the script of an ancient novel rather than the life of the last queen of ancient Egypt. The filmmakers obviously did not create this to be a factual account of Cleo's life. The acting of Billy Zane (Antony) and Timothy Dalton (Cesar) was very good, and Lenor Varella (Cleopatra) offers a good show if you like passion and exaggerated drama. If you want to see a televised and modern view of Cleopatra's life, this is her movie, but Cleopatra's film starring Elizabeth Taylor is far superior.""",0

"b'Simplifying: Style over substance. There are some excellent sequences, but that\'s all this movie looks like, well planned and executed sequences - but without anything coherent, sticking it all together. The \'near-impact plane and the last-minute rescue\' is extremely impressive and the machine-gun ammunition crashing into Supe\'s chest, followed by the bullet in the eye, is magnificent. My chin was falling and I almost wanted to cheer. That\'s what Superman is about: seeing him defeat the bad guys in new, interesting ways - even fun. But that\'s when the fun ended. As Superman is not, it\'s children\'s love and ridiculous heroic jokes with kryptonite. I think both are so horribly implausible that both should be ridiculed. Like Brodie (skillfully played by Jason Lee in Kevin Smith\'s Mallrats), ""It\'s impossible! Lois Lane could never have Superman\'s baby. Do you think your fallopian tubes could handle your sperm? I assure you that when he comes during sex, he probably blows a load like a shotgun blast ... across her back. ""So, besides Lois Lane being alive after intercourse, you would have the impossibility of a human being conceiving and bringing the term of an alien\'s son to the term. Do not forget that just because Clark Kent looks and ostensibly acts like a human, he is an alien. He is a different species entirely. And totally different species can not mate. Just think of the chaos that would ensue in the animal kingdom if a lion falls in love and mates with a crocodile. Or a graffiti. The other issue that makes me shake with rage is the whole crappy concept of Superman being physically able to lift an entire continent of kryptonite into outer space. As the internet blogger dpogue21 speaks so proficiently (much better than I do - so thank you dpogue) in his review of imdb, ""my next big complaint is that Superman raises a continent made of kryptonite into outer space. He does not get the Simpsons comic book guy to point out what\'s wrong with that. I do not know how many comic books Bryan Singer has read, but when Superman is exposed to a small amount of kryptonite he barely has the strength to stand. Whoever has had the idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bmaking him fly on a big island, made up of his greatest weakness in space, has no business being associated with any other Superman-related project. The concept is as ridiculous as making a Dracula movie, where the title character has a stake in his heart and still manages to pilot a spaceship made out of garlic in the sun. Why does not only Superman eat kryptonite? He can eat it and then brush his teeth with it and then sleep in kryptonite pajamas. This is no more absurd than having him hoisting a continent of kryptonite into space and then falling helplessly through the atmosphere without burning into re-entry or spreading throughout the central park when it hits the ground. \'\' Do I need to say more? I do not think so. ** [...]'",0
"b""The special effects were good, but the story was weak, silly and predictable. As a kid, I loved the Alien movies. Aliens (the second) is considered a classic in our house as we still laugh about how my mom caused M & M's to rain in the theater after an alien scared her. So with that, I was excited to see this movie and relive some of the memories. What a disappointment. It was not scary at all. The people in the theater were actually *** Sleeping ***. I was jealous of them. I was very happy that this was a short movie. Unfortunately, the scariest thing in this movie was a penguin. I do not see that. If you are a big foreign fan or predator and must catch it, wait for video or HBO.""",0
"b""Peter Brooks' Spartan adaptation of William Golding's immortal romance about a group of English students stranded on a dessert island still runs almost four decades after its initial launch. Despite a total lack of star names and limited production values, the film is successful thanks to the performances of children's actors and a general primitivism that makes everything imminently believable. At first, the castaways seem not to be so bad; there is a lot of food, no adult and no predator ... except for maybe one, one & quot; beastie & quot; which can be a strange animal or a ghost or something much worse ... A touching, always poignant accusation of inherent human savagery, Lord of the Flies manages to translate the essence of Golding's tale into the canvas. Like many adults, children think they are good enough to make their own utopia. So much for utopia. So much for childish innocence.""",1

"b'Poor Bellini! Out of fashion for a century and rescued from near obscurity by the Maria Callas thegenius just to be destroyed by this horror. What should we do about Zimmerman\'s absurd production? Bellini in some kind of big city loft, the characters, the action in total disagreement with the romantic track of bel canto, the opera reduced to almost farce. It may have been saved by a higher corner, but even that is missing. It is almost as if the singers were wondering, ""What the hell is this absurdity and why we are here!"" Every operatic presentation should be a tribute to the composer, but in this case it is nothing more than a reverence for the director and his obvious need to be seen as outrageous and inventive.We can only shudder at the thought of what she has in store for the future performance of the opera (if any.) Can we wait anxiously for her Norma in Detroit, a metaphor for the collapse of the inner city? I would be surprised.'",0

Do not get me wrong, it\'s cool to see the guys playing again, and watching Kim stand sober along the way, wandering around the cities, and so on. But the main problem with this document is that it is absolutely annoying. And they get in the way of the key issues in all the minds of fans: the reasons for the breakup and the possibility of new music. In fact, the best part of this film (other than the song) is the impromptu fan interviews Kelly does. She starts asking questions! What a concept! This is such a wasted opportunity. The filmmakers were either inept, or very impressed and ""honored to be chosen"" to make a movie in some depth. We get a lazy love letter. Making movies from the toes. Look, I love all things Pixies. Period. And on a certain level, that\'s cool to see just because I really love this band. And if you\'re a big fan of Pixies, you\'ll probably like that up to a point.

"b""Of the trailers and the presence of Julia Roberts in the cast, I joined CLOSER expecting a mild romantic comedy. (My prejudices have not been so destroyed since I saw Bambi's mother being shot by hunters in the matinee on Saturday!) CLOSER opens when Alice (Natalie Portman), a stripper from New York on a visit to London, is hit by a car after that she looked to the left, instead of to the right, coming off the curb. She is taken to the hospital by a stranger, Dan (Jude Law), an aspiring writer with whom she initiates a life relationship. So, Dan sits down to a formal portrait of photographer Anna (Julia Roberts), in whom he beats to no avail. Later, Larry (Clive Owen), a dermatologist, meets Anna, with whom he marries, later divorces after discovering that she had recent sexual relations with Dan, who was once rejected. In rebounding and in need of physical comfort, Larry looks for Alice, now wearing clothes at a London strip club after leaving Dan, and with whom he had already met at one of Anna's photo exhibitions. But Dan still longs for Alice and is emotionally devastated that she has had sex with Larry. Is that confusing or what? (The timeline is obscure, apparently all of this happens over two years.) CLOSER is a painful, watchful, sexually manipulating, obsessive, and haunting film in which the four main characters inflict emotional cruelties on one another. It's not a holiday for an afternoon at the movies with your elderly mother. The language is sexually graphic and, in a sequence of scenes in the London band, visually daring. CLOSER is, however, one of the best films of 2004. Julia Roberts is perhaps the biggest surprise, since it shows that she can radically transcend - even beyond ERIN BROCKOVICH (2000) - her usual cute roles; I was very impressed. It would be difficult to choose the leading role and supporting pieces of this film. All four (Portman, Law, Roberts, Owen) have roughly the same screen time (although I'm not following a timer). Any one of them, or all of them, could win an Oscar nomination. I had started to doze off a quarter of the movie, but then I woke up almost startled when I realized that CLOSER is an exceptional adult movie, not visually explicit. sex or violence, which brutally shows adults in dysfunctional relationships behaving in the worst case. Truly, as indicated by a line in KINSEY: '' Sex is a dangerous game. If you are not careful, you can cut it open wide. ''""",1
"b'WHAT IS THE HOLLYWOOD PROBLEM, ANYWAY? This is the biggest movie ever made. Okay, maybe I honestly do not believe it. Maybe `` The Cable Guy \'\' is a little better. Okay, maybe it\'s a play. I can not decide. Oh, hell, it does not matter! I think what I\'m getting at is that I\'m very sick and tired of hearing people cheat on this movie. I\'m so tired of this, in fact, that I\'m going to lie shamelessly to people who do not like it and say it\'s my favorite movie, even if it\'s not. They are not my favorite Arnold movies, but I still rank him among the top ten. It\'s not even a tenth as bad as they say it is. There were eager fans of Schwarzenegger who actually came to detest Arnold after he made this movie. Why do I ask? BECAUSE ? I demand to know! Is it acting? Is it the script? Is it the story and the premise? Special effects, car chases, what? Okay, the acting is tacky. I\'ll give it to you. The story is exaggerated and the action is exaggerated. I\'ll give you that, too. But guess what, you stupid idiots? It\'s supposed to be like this! This movie was conceived as a social commentary. It\'s satire. It was intended to make fun of the films by example. It points to the most inherent flaw in the entire cinema. Fantasy! That\'s right ! It exposes the film industry for what it is. That is, a circus, a crazy house, a mad dog, a wild beast, a monolithic volcano of glamor, pretension, vanity and and ... And just ... shrill screams - FRAUD - OK, that\'s it. I just answered my own question. The reason Hollywood detests such disdain for this film is simply because it does not like to be the subject of debates like morality and ethics. It\'s not like it\'s a big secret, though, that Hollywood is full of fakes, satanists, ... and demon worshipers. The world knew this years ago. Does not it seem to hurt the grosses, though? People still watch the movies. They keep watching television. They continue to tune into that Oscar-nominated political media circus. Weird Holly is clearly okay. So why did this movie so scare you? Do not ask me. All I can say is that Arnold Schwarzeneger had to have a lot of balls to be in a movie like this. Especially when he was still a newcomer to the profession of actor and America. But hey, it\'s just an action movie, and it has a good plot. Still, there seems to be no end to the contempt that filmmakers and critics have for Arnold. That\'s not what irritates me the most, though. What irritates me the most is that the audience that goes to the movies can be so naive and stupid as to accept whatever Hollywood tells them about a particular movie. Not critical, mind you. No one else pays attention to critics. Especially the stupid rich, with their big thick books and their big thick mustaches. No, I\'m talking about the entertainment industry in general. Usually, if every actor, director, producer, and every type of talk show joins a particular individual, or a particular movie, and shouts at the top of their collective lungs: ""THIS WORK IS TERRIBLE. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE, \'\' everyone believes in them. What these people should be shouting is ""WE HAVE FEAR WE ARE JELOUS WE WANT TO SEE THAT THIS IS A LACK OF PEOPLE"" This is all about entertainment It\'s about an artist stabbing another in the back It\'s not about teamwork anymore. Usually, if enough people in the profession report the work of a particular person, the rest of the world will think, ""Well, gee! Everyone in Hollywood thinks this movie sucks. Must be true. Well, I\'m not going to waste my money. \'\' That\'s why this movie bombed. Not because of your quality or lack of it, but because of the quantity. That is, amount of people in the business who said it was not good. And the so-called fans, as well as the band of impressionable troglodytes and fingerhunters that they are, fell into this. They stayed away from the mass movie. And what do you think happened? Well, the movie failed of course. It is the most daring attempt of Arnold Scwarzenegger of artistic genius and no one went to see the fuck thing. Well, let me tell you something. I saw the movie, and I liked it! And I\'m not alone! But I\'m tired of feeling like an idiot anytime I play that movie. I\'m sick of people laughing at me when I tell them I\'m a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger, a fan of Jim Carrey, a fan of Norm Macdonald or a fan of Stephen King. I\'m sick of it, and I will not take it. If anyone here needs to feel ashamed, YOU ARE POEPLE! I do not care what anyone says. So, you all can kiss my $$ and go to hell. I love this movie, and I\'m going to kill someone who tries to change my mind. That said, buy this DVD. It\'s certainly cheap enough (unfortunately for Arnold).'",1

"b""Starting in the late 1950s, there were a number of country music films made, perhaps in reaction to the success of rock and roll movies of the same era. Most of them featured some kind of plot involving rubies getting into all sorts of problems. But these films were not just the crazy, mad luck of hipsters; they were the crazy and crazy misfortune of hipsters who had famous country music stars as friends. In other words, the fragile plots and movie stars disappearing were just an excuse to showcase a huge amount of country music stars of the time. Many of the performances were synchronized, although some were recorded live. The Nashville sound, which was recorded in 1969, was different. Perhaps influenced by the Pennebaker documentaries of the time, this film had no fragile plot or cheeky jokes. Instead, it was a serious look at Nashville and the stars of the reigning country of the day. It is well filmed, complete and fascinating to watch. Much of it was filmed at the Grand Ole Opry, but you also have invaluable footage, like Loretta Lynn's playing for a radio audience and record company staff, Bashful Brother Oswald singing a Mountain Dew chorus off of Ernest Tubb's Record Store. , a rehearsal of Mother Earth (with Tracy Nelson), a performance outside Shelby Singleton's house, a recording session with Doug Kershaw and a young, beardless Charlie Daniels, and more. There are also great filming in Nashville. All performances are excellent, and the film does a great job of capturing the essence of country music of the era - performers, fans and people in the industry. I've been waiting for a long time for this to come out on DVD!""",1

You can see why Tom Cruise follows him in his ways. This film is directed very well by the underrated Edward Zwick and Tom Cruise gives a very good performance. The only problem I have with this movie is how important it is. Even movies of this magnitude should not worry so much about epic chords. We understand that this is a great historical epic.

"b""The action movies remind me of the true beauty of the movies, how a story can be told through visual arrangements and movements through the frame, rather than dead dialogues and two still actors talking. These films are like plays filmed while others are drawn from their silent black and white songs. white roots, telling stories without words. Road Warrior contains one of the best examples of this - such a small moment, a small obstacle overcome, but dancing boldly across the screen like a painter. Here is the magic, shot by shot. Halfway through the final chase sequence, a red hotrod approaches the truck of Max's big rig with intent to kill him. In a scene that has been copied many times, Max emerges from the cab and throws his shotgun at the camera - forced perspective, moving to the right and then to the left, back and forth, zigzagging across the screen. The villain's head explodes like a firework, and we are presented with a cry of joy from Max's wild wolf friend - an animalistic reaction to the violence ironically given by a child raised by animals. Now we have a series of jumps. cuts that tell the little story of the red car losing control and hitting other villain vehicles. This little story is closed by the famous and almost peaceful shot of a man turning upside down in a horizontal fall, again in forced perspective flying toward the camera. Now another series of jumps cuts as we bounce back to the red hotrod and it's struggle to get out underneath the huge wheels of Max. In a nice motion game, the car dances in front of Max's truck, running from one side to the other. another in front of Max and our screens like a hanging carrot, until we have a third view of forced perspective: the camera approaches the grate. of the truck, then climbs up and into the cab at Max, when Max finally ends the misery of the car, nailing him in an explosion of gasoline and bits of metal. Such a sick and distorted beauty ... Did you know that George Miller, director of Road Warrior, also directed Babe?""",1

This documentary in this respect is a small exception. The quality of the tape was - Gyarrbage.

All this to the glory of saying you can go to BLOCKS with wheelee in your mind. Wink\'s commentary and the few comic characters he created for himself are funny, but short. They are funny in a bizarre and way too long. There are many scenes with repeated scenes. It\'s only an hour, but by the time you watch your hundredth round - you\'re finished - and in Wink\'s words, feeling like ""Gyarbage"" for buying this tape. My recommendation would be to wait for the Biker Boyz to come out on DVD and simply continue the scenes from the movie in which the main character and his team are letting the professional STUNT Doubles do tricks. There is nothing like this in this RR project and with all the hype that they put in - there should be.

So in that sense, I was a bit disappointed. there is a video produced by american parkour that is specifically for introduction to parkour training. I'll probably get that too.

"b'I also really love the original release and bought the 2 disc edition for a while. I usually have an aversion to Hollywood marketing tricks, but from what I heard Mark Steven Johnson in his comment from the previous release, they were actually shocked at the time during production, especially with some of the CG stuff. They also fought a bit with the MPAA to maintain their PG-13 rating. (It\'s hard to be true to the darkness of the comic book series, as we market it for the most optimized revenue returns.) With luck, they\'ve taken the time to incorporate the extra-fight footage into the story and touch up some of painful CG shots (among many good ones). Leaving aside the marketing tricks, I think there is additional pressure for directors these days to \'\' get the product out the door, \'\' that they have to make various artistic commitments (& agrave; LOTR). I really hope this DVD has been made for Johnson to ""complete his original vision"" for an already good movie!'",1

"b""& quot; The Breakfast Club & quot; is the brat movie that I dare to imagine will be remembered for a long time as a watershed in American cinema - at least as far as teen comedy is concerned. The plot (for those who are not yet familiar with it) revolves around 5 teenagers from various walks of life, forced to sit down together during a detention session on Saturday afternoon. A hilarious, well-crafted and often poignant film about the fundamental truths that make us all human, John Hughes & quot; The Breakfast Club & quot; is perhaps the greatest exploitation of the anguish and confusion that plagued us during the high school years. UNIVERSAL's remastering efforts on this DVD provide some of its own angst. Despite being extended to 16X9 monitors, this newly created DVD offers nothing in terms of video improvement over the previously issued DVD. The colors are dated, unrealistic, often unbalanced with some bleeding and blemishes. Fine details are minimal, even in well-lit scenes. Contrast, shadow, and black levels are extremely poor. Age-related artifacts, including chips, scratches and cuts of spice splashes are all evident. There is a considerable amount of film grain present everywhere for a totally unsatisfactory visual presentation. The audio - remixed to 5.1 in both Dolby and DTS displays a dated feature with muted dialogue and virtually no spatial separation, except in the music tracks.EXTRAS: A theatrical trailer that is heavily used.BOTTOM LINE: & quot; The Breakfast Club & quot; It's a brilliant movie. However, the lack of extras (a documentary would have been good) and the very low processing of the transfer led me to say that this record really is not worth the money.""",0
"b""It only takes a few minutes to see how terrible this thing is. The movie begins with some jets involved in a high-speed transcontinental run. Well, our hero pilot Grant (Antonio Sabato Jr.) decides he needs to be restocked. Have you seen a pit crew refuel a car on the track during a NASCAR race? No ... not me. It would be kind of dangerous, I suppose. Well, Grant's jet is refueled by another plane while they're on the direct flight path of the other race jets. What happens ? Duh ... there's a horrible collision and three pilots (along with 11 spectators ... huh?) They're dead. Nice personal move. Maybe the funniest, and most pathetic, event in the movie happens a little later. Several years have passed since the tragic jet race incident and we are listening to a network executive who made a live broadcast of the race. The executive says ... are you ready? ... he says footage of the jets colliding during the race was the most highly valued part of the news footage they've shown in the last four years. Unbelievable! ! Talk about a future world in which nothing exciting happens. Must be boring. Other things to look for are a guy who is somehow making a coughing noise while his mouth is not even moving. Also, a scene where a Sabato Jr. shirtless is about to put on a T-shirt. It picks up, but the camera changes angle and now it's nowhere. Then the camera changes the angles again and it is pulling it by the head. Great edition! Everything is bargain basement in this movie, except for the decent acting in the middle of the way. With a fine plot of paper and terrible effects, however, I strongly recommend not wasting your time watching this dreck. One final note ... no nudity and no graphic violence, I have no idea why this is classified as R.""",0

In this case, Uwe Boll, responsible for such outrageous films as Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead, somehow managed to get into the cast, is very difficult. believe they were willing to risk a Uwe Boll movie based on video games.

The most depressing thing about Bloodrayne is that the film really was good enough abroad (predictably, it failed as a nightmare in the United States, earning two and a half million, well under a fifth of its budget) that Vivendi gave birth to Bloodrayne II.

"b'This movie almost reminds me of the sitcom Alice TV: set up in a small restaurant, out of the way, run by a weird head chef with a heart of gold, and composed of a trio of waitresses, the impetuous Blondie Southern, the naive and naive, and single mother with upright head (or future mother in this case) along with the typical assortment of crazy and colorful clients. The writer / director Adrienne Shelly can take this model and do something wonderful with it. Far from being a mere remake of Alice, Waitress is a well-conceived and well-executed exploration of a woman\'s struggle for herself and realizing her dreams despite the bad choices and wrong decisions she made along the way. This really distinguishes this movie from most other big screen screenplay options. The dialogue, written by Adrienne Shelly - who also directed and co-starred as Dawn, the coarse waitress who eventually finds true love - shines with humor, charm and humor. It\'s fast and funny, but it always seems totally natural, largely due, of course, to the talents of the actors and actresses charged with handing it over. Unlike the writing in, say, Gilmore Girls, widely praised for its unique character, the dialogue in Waitress never seems forced or unnatural. It\'s brilliant without being intrusive. My only size for this movie is the fact that the message ""men are dogs"" is a bit heavy. Without exception, all the male characters in Waitress are introduced as, say, Earl (Jeremy Sisto), without principles, like Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion), or simply weird, like Ogie (Eddie Jemison). Even Joe (Andy Griffith), who is really kind and affectionate, is shown throughout much of the film as being arduous and demanding, to the point that Jenna, who suffers a lot, is the only person who can deal with him and is truly true. his only friend. This is obviously a woman-made movie, especially for a female audience, but we can not help thinking that if a man made a movie where all the female characters were nothing more than claws of gold, abusive, whores, it would be a serious reaction, although well deserved. Waitress is a good movie that deserves to be seen. It is tragic that Shelly, who was brutally murdered in November 2006, will not make any more films, as this film will undoubtedly bring awareness of the writer / director\'s impressive talent to a much wider audience than ever before. . Fortunately, the waitress is an appropriate memorial to be remembered.'",1

"b'The cultural revolution that rocked Paris between 1905 and 1930 is well documented in this mesmerizing two-hour DVD documentary, which includes photographs, film archives, literary excerpts, and analysis. Focus on the arts, from classical music and jazz to sculpture, from poetry to dance, from paintings painted to romances. The rise of Modernism from post-Impressionists to Fauvism, Cubism, Dada and Surrealism and its numerous literary and beaux-arts pioneers is seen as an extraordinary period of free experimentation and interdisciplinary interactions, particularly between poets and artists. Paris was the fermenting pot and the vanguard was strong, sharp, and multiple. Watching this documentary can induce envy. The have lived in such a moment!

This brings a small deficiency in documentary: the absence of any mention of developments in science, especially physics, and its influence on the arts, when the concepts of time, space and matter were radically new themes of thought. Otherwise, the research is a wonderful cultural history, from prewar optimism and the engine of cynicism and creative criticism after that carnage. The viewer can delve into many books that cover this exciting period for further study. This DVD is an excellent introduction in the history of art and cultural studies.'",1
"b""We should all congratulate Uwe Boll. He's kind of like a movie cheap. No matter how small talent he has, and no matter how bad these films are, he can continue to do so. I know, he funds all of them himself through some kind of bizarre German fund, but even so, his ability to keep making movies despite absolute and complete failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe. It would not be so bad except that video game developers keep giving their best properties to this guy. I really enjoyed the Alone in the Dark series of games. Even the newest, the New Nightmare, was good for a few hours of gameplay. There was a good movie to be made from the adventures of Edward Carnby, but that's not it. Now Uwe Boll got his hands on Bloodrayne and Hunter: the Reckoning. What comes next, Silent Hill? Doom? I can only imagine the track that this guy will cut through adaptations from game to movie if he is not stopped. Someone needs to take out their line of credit, or these video game publishers need to understand and realize that when they make a bad movie of a game that kills the franchise, no one is more interested in that title. Think about it, is House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark a viable game title anymore? No way . A new House of the Dead game comes out on XBox and no one will mind. The title is dead and all because of Uwe Boll. So if any of you out there working for a game publisher, meeting a game publisher, or having access to a game publisher ... please let them know. This movie itself is not even worth reviewing. I can not separate what I did not like from this dung heap from the rest. Literally, all about it sucks. Writing, acting, music, CG effects, editing. I thought that if I waited until it came out on DVD and then rented with low expectations, I would not be disappointed. Even the $ 5 you spend on this DVD, if you buy it used by one of Amazon's sellers, is too much. You will regret it. This movie is just a bunch of Boll.""",0

The boy in this story is definitely Hugh Grant's character and, to credit the story, a second boy, who is of legal age to be an authentic boy, is introduced. He enters Grant's life and turns everything upside down and they both learn to be men. Instead of opting for a broad comedy, the script is more subtle, focusing on dilemmas, contradictions, hypocrisies and even finding humor in their tragic failures. It's really a drama that takes everything very seriously. But because it sees the light at the end of the tunnel, it very clearly teaches us that when life brings an end to something, it also offers a beginning to something else. Let's embrace him!""",1

Anyone who has ever wanted to get ahead but was a victim of class snobbery and arrogance in the workplace will relate to this movie.

"b'This musical still enchants and enchants us ... more than 40 years after it was made. It wins our old-fashioned applause - with good solid music and dance entertainment. Robert Preston shines like Professor Harold Hill ... an unscrupulous con man who starts deceiving the entire population (about 2,400) of River City, Iowa. He delights his heart (and pocket) and manages to stay one step ahead of the authorities. Along the way, he (Prof. Hill) touches the life of a spinster (Shirley Jones as Marian, the Librarian). and his extremely shy brother Winthrop (played by a very young and lovely Ronnie Howard) and, to his surprise, he finds himself in the unknown territory of a good director. His planned escape paralyzed, he is caught, and must, um, face the music. Along the way, you are given some memorable and fun songs and some delightful dance routines. The filmmakers showed some courage ... using some imagination and risking ... and gave us a lot of entertainment. My favorite places are the opening train sequence and the very excellent dance (and song) scene inside the library. The townsfolk of Rio City are made to be stubborn and narrow minded ... but in reality they are every comedy producer. Virtually all the adult characters in the movie give their share of the workload ... and add humor to the overall fun of the picture. Paul Ford, like confused Mayor George Shinn, is particularly good ... and Hermione Gingold, who plays her wife Eulalie, is also funny (though in a different way). Shirley Jones is very good here. She has always been a great singer, but also does some effective acting and footwork. Pert Kelton, like his Irish mother, is a delight. But the show pretty much belongs to Robert Preston. A more capable artist, he is light on his feet and equally agile (and nimble) while handling his lines. He\'s not a great singer ... he speaks most of the lyrics in his songs ... but they (the songs) work, and they work well. I heard this in the pre-production phase of making the film. , they wanted to replace Robert Preston (the star of the theatrical version of ""The Music Man"") by someone else.

The most intriguing part about this documentary is the lack of real dialogue with Michael Jackson, but you can totally sense in his expressions the gears that actively work inside him; He was pouring every ounce of effort he could muster in this ultimate endeavor to thrill the world. This is Michael Jackson, unlike he has been seen in years. Here he sings all his live songs, even the oldest such as Jam, They Do not Care About Us, and Smooth Criminal - this element also shows fans how exhausting it was for him to give to the crowds Dancing and singing, and this footage makes it clear why for the Dangerous and History tours he had to synchronize several numbers faster.Many MJ dance moves are omitted, and I wish we could have seen some of the footage from the rehearsal without the occasional distraction of short- (I wanted them to put it on a split screen so we could see the footage and the stage performance at the same time).

All of this is probably going to be remembered as being the greatest concert that ever happened in the history of music. From these few vague excerpts from what is the show This Is It, we can see that Michael would have had a huge return through this series of concerts, and that once again he proved that he was and always will be the King of Pop. that although the tabloids tried to put him in the light of evil, Michael Jackson\'s only message was of love.

"b""I found this movie very enjoyable. The plot is simple and somewhat unimportant - Camille, a well-known Parisian actress, is returning from Rome to perform in front of her home audience in a play directed by her new lover, Ugo. The play is Come Tu Mi Vuoi, by Pirandello, a classic work (written for her lover Martha Abba) about a woman trapped between the yin and yang forces of reality and illusion. Throughout the film Rivette changes his camera between the game and Camille and Ugo's `` reality '' as if to us, who are the real Camille and Ugo ask. What do they really want? What makes ticks? Can I, the viewer, enter into your universe without a script? Rivette (and his excellent actors) shows us that the delicacy can be robust and inventive, that the desire for another can never be realized and that the realization does not really matter, because in the process of the struggle to achieve it we become alive and creative. What matters is style; style is substance. We are also treated with a brilliant representation of the incestuous relationship between the Italians and the French and there is a delightful succession of nuances, suggestions and plays with the national stereotypes that brought many smiles in my face. I can see why some - those accustomed to Hollywood cliches with their happy endings and predictable plots - may not find the movie so hot. Well, that's too bad ...""",1
"b""It is unforgettable that I wasted much energy anticipating this turkey. If you happen to be a fan of B movies, then you're probably going to really enjoy it. Fine plot, idiot dialogues and special effects they must have stolen from Monty Python (hint of blood sprayed and flying body parts!). What if ; however, you are a fan of good fantasy movies and do not waste your time or money! I recently discovered that they are making a sequel! Who are they kidding! ! ! The first one badly paid for itself!""",0
b'Do not bother with that! The film was cut into pieces in the transfer. The trailer at the end shows how much is missing.',0
"b""This video was like watching a 1950s film with 16mm of age. No text, just somebody's homemade video. DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO, IT'S A GREAT ROB!""",0
"b'I bought this DVD expecting that the quality of the video in this ""remastered"" version would be an improvement on the much cheaper original version I had purchased a few years ago. Not so. [The star is by the quality of the product, not by the film. Ginger Rogers Rocks].'",0
"b""Finally, this movie is released on blu ray in its proper proportion! Tired of watching it in 1080i and at a cut ratio of 1.78, I actually should not use the word crop because it's Super 35, so they just opened the bottom of the frame for you to see more at the bottom ( always hated fake letterboxing). Anyway this blu ray, as the DVD shows the film in the ratio of 2.35. The video is minor upgrade to DVD clarity, but not the Wow! factor we can expect from 1080p blu ray. The problem could be that Warner / New Line used a single-layer disc (25 GB) and not the top 50 GB disc. Why they, when the only thing on this disc is the movie and a theatrical trailer. I can not believe that Warner released it the way they did. Do not pay the exorbitant price that Amazon is asking for. I got my under 14 bucks at Best Buy. For this price is worth the upgrade. The soundtrack is still one of the best! All in all, even with the smaller video update over DVD, it is still a good buy at cheap price ... just wish it was better to blu ray presentation. Stop being cheap Warner!""",1
"b'I do not know what to say to this movie mess. Firstly, I did not play the video game, but I would probably win an acadamy award before that movie. What a discredit for probably an excellent video game. Yeah, it started out like it was cool, so people tried to act. What can I say, Michael Madsen ... It seems you never rehearsed and were reading suggestion letters. It simply does not fit that role. He seems to just keep the gangster role in any movie he has, never adapting his effect. Second, the dialogue was weak and the plot predictable. The love scene, what was the deal with it, what cheap trick to drag youngsters to the theaters, launch a porn scene in any movie and walla, you can make your money back, releasing it as an unrated version . Just a horrible movie. I just hope some bigwig from Hollywood does not get the big idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8ba sequel, alas, it hurts just thinking about it. Do not even bother ... sorry for every seller here in amazon, this movie will probably take a while. So bad'",0
"b""While the content of this DVD may be good, the presentation is simply miserable and I do not believe this has been released. It's basically a video tape placed on DVD with random chapter stops that do not even match the songs. One could have spent an extra 10 minutes on it and made it a good DVD. Until they fix the shoddy work they did on this record, do not buy it. In addition, the two puppet remixes are just plain creepy.""",0
"b""It hurts me to have a negative review when it comes to Harry Potter, but this is about the record and not the movie. I love the show and would love to watch it again! Here is the problem. When I first got this movie, I was able to watch BlueRay a total of two times before it stopped after the introduction. The third attempt to watch was a few days after 30 days and would have no option to get to the movie. The DVD version works fine. After a little struggle, Amazon made an exception and replaced it. Now, after receiving it and deciding to watch it again, I'm finding the same thing. This time I'm SOL. I have a top of the line Sony BlueRay and have never had any other problem so I know it is not my player. Maybe they got a bad batch of WB? Has anyone else had this problem as well?""",0
"b'John Carpenter takes a welcome change of pace with this invisible man movie that brings great new ideas to the genre. (Best of all is that chevy clothes become invisible too, so he does not have to walk naked) Chevy Chase is surprisingly adorable in the title role and Sam Neil is great as a CIA agent. As you probably guessed, the special effects are also brilliant.'",1
"b""Toilet training is part of the parenting process and although it usually begins in the child years, it may take more time with some children than others. Potty Power tries to speed up the process by presenting a DVD that encourages kids to use the potty and give up their diapers or pull-ups for good. Performs his goal through his potty talk, songs, skit and optimistic attitude about the potty's use. Jessica, the narrator of Potty Power, is encouraging and extremely excited. She talks about pee and poop, slang for bodily functions and more, while managing to keep a smile on her face everywhere. She really wants kids to learn how to use the potty, and her enthusiasm will hopefully be passed on to the children watching the DVD. This DVD certainly has its usefulness and I know many people who have had great success showing this training session to their students. young children. But it gets a little tacky and many adults will roll their eyes while listening to the dialogue and the songs. Songs like I am proud to wear my underwear, Wipe Your Bottom and others are certainly captivating for small children, but even some young people will find the stuff too silly to be true. One of my children is already trained to go to the bathroom and she laughs loudly when watching this DVD, due to her silly and often cowardly style. Leaving aside, what matters most is the effectiveness of the DVD and my experience, Potty Power made a difference. My youngest daughter likes to repeat the lines she has heard on this DVD and she likes to sing along with the songs. She has gone alone to the potty, so the DVD seems to be having a positive effect, even if it sometimes becomes annoying. Potent Power, despite its nonsense, is an effective means of weaning children. their diapers and pull-ups. If you can get through the goofiness of the whole experience, the overabundance of the narrator and the weird sketch at the end, Potty Power seems to have something to do with it. Kids will remember the songs and the message, making this DVD a good addition to toilet training.""",1
"b'It\'s a great movie. Unfortunately my four hour vhs off air copy mode done about 30 years ago is a recording superior to the DVD I just watched that I presume is the current release, having bought it January 15, 2010. There is no doubt that this dvd was mastered from a vhs. How can I know? When the ""hi-fi"" audio tracks on a tape track you, it produces a very different sound of vibration. This DVD is full of this kind of disagreement. Then there is the overlap in the spool exchange, where about 45 seconds of the show are repeated, followed immediately by a breakup and an upcut that omits about 95% of a scene. For a commercial release, this kind of quality is totally unacceptable. There is a special place in the future for the ""engineer"" who has mastered this crap. Here\'s a thought: Forget the sophisticated menu and so-called ""extras"" and try to give the customer a clean record of the program.'",0
"b'A very bad copy for a DVD, my copy on VHS is much better. Some scenes are out of focus. Some pictures are off center. I would look for a better edition.'",0
"b'Manny Pontoriero\'s latest set of instructional DVDs includes two DVDs that offer excellent instruction in landscape photography. As with previous Manny instructional DVDs, watching a DVD just once is not enough. Instead, watch a DVD, take multiple pictures, and watch the DVD again. Digital photography allows you to take many shots of a scene, from all angles, using different lenses and filters, with an immediate review of your efforts and without the need for development like in film photography. The first DVD includes several sessions with Manny\'s offer. classroom-style instruction that includes drawings and samples of a topic. So it is for the field to use these principles in action. It\'s in the first DVD that Manny also explains Parallel Thinking. Parallel thinking is ""how else can I picture this scene""? Do not just take the picture you first saw. Instead, what other options (different times of day, different seasons, wearing different lenses, etc.) can you use to capture the scenes in one location? The second DVD offers 14 sessions on the field at different locations along the east coast. In each session, Manny provides a detailed description of what he is doing at each location, along with why. Throughout these sessions, there is information that you may lose but are important. For example, if you are stacking filters on a lens, use a lifting ring to be able to use larger filters on a lens and do not vignet your photo. Or, do not change the lenses on the beach if the wind is blowing because you do not want to put sand grains on the lens or camera; and, vacuum the lens and camera when you return home to remove any grains of sand on the outer surfaces. The second DVD contains a 15th bonus session in which Manny moves from the camera to the computer to briefly explain what changes he could make to a specific photo. . It uses the raw Photoshop editor to make these adjustments, along with the neutral density adjustment available in that editor. I highly recommend Manny\'s DVD sets, especially this set of two landscape photographs on DVD.'",1
"b""I do not know who I'm feeling anymore, Stephen Dorff or Christian Slater. Dorff, who is a great actor, although you never know about the movies he is in, has not been anything but remote since the original Blade in 1998. Slater's career has declined over the years, practically taking part in some flop projects . Both actors walk peacefully through their roles in this latest video game for the film adaptation of director Uwe Boll, the same guy who brought us another video game adaptation, the incredibly bad House of the Dead. Alone in the dark is not much better, with a story so non-existent you'll be scratching your head wondering what's going on before you pray for all to be killed. Tara Reid is also on board as the smart girl, and as previous reviewers have mentioned, we know she's smart because she wears glasses. There is no redeeming factor about Alone in the Dark, and if you have been subjected to the House of the Dead farce, then you know what to expect here.""",0
"b""Last Unicorn may be my favorite movie to date and I was so excited to know it was finally announced in the US. Finally, I would have The Last Unicorn, a classic piece of animation in digital quality! However, little did I know that the producer would put all $ 2 in the DVD release of this great film. First, it is only in Standard that it is certain that the movie was cut from its original widescreen (which is how the laserdisc was presented) to a formatted format to fit in its TV mode. You may notice this when Mom's fortune wagon passes by and half of the words are cut off from the image. Secondly, the digital transfer is horrible! if I did not know better, they copied the VHS master to the DVD. the colors are all blah and the animation is lost. This intrigues me because I also own the German widescreen version (which is amazing !!) and its transfer is flawless and sharp! Third, has anyone forgotten the special features of this disc? ! Play movie or scene selection. it is ! . Lastly this movie has the worst art of the box! and not for that matter the art is also on the disc and on the interactive menus (which play some awful god made for dvd elevator music!) This version of an amazing movie is a crime! Artisan (the company) should really rethink this and launch a new special download edition. But that is never going to happen .""",0
"b""I got into this movie trying to have an open mind, considering that I had heard, at best, mixing things up about it. But within the first 15 minutes, I knew it was a mistake to take a chance. It looks like a straight line to the video clunker, and that's basically what it is. the plot is simple. A man driving down a lonely road at night. There is a love triangle that went wrong and a lot of speculation about what's in the trunk and why it's there. But frankly, I did not care about any of that. The acting is horrible and the writing is laughable. So, trust me ... do not bother with it.""",0
"b""I could not get through the whole thing. The cast is impressive, but they all act as if they've lost a bet. I could not get this disk off my device and go back to the store fast enough. Thank God, I did not buy it! Stay away, far from it.""",0
"b""Engineers from the British army arrived on a mission to build a bridge and ended up fighting a three-day war. This film is an icon of the 1960s. Clear and crisp colors. Red Brit. Tommies in uniform face the spear and shield that carry Zulus. No side will. Just from a cinematic experience, one should watch this movie. Some people may have scruples about death and carnage, but it is a fascinating slice of human drama. All the actors have wonderful performances, and I think this is one of Michael Caine's best. Also, the result of John Barry is the best. non-James Bond score that he made. All around a good Friday night or Saturday afternoon movie.""",1
"b'Bad script. Bad performance. Bad direction. Poor production. Simply bad. For those who think this piece of junk deserves a look, consider this: would you want your life story told by a disgruntled ex-spouse and a lying accountant?'",0
"b'Uwe Boll has to be the worst director of work in Hollywood! How does he get money and actors to work on the garbage he calls the movie? Michael Madsen gives a wooden performance and Ben Kingsley is a little better. I think they figured that if they showed up and said their lines, the director would be happy. Anyway getting through in this movie is that you are indecisive.'",0
"b'What happened to that talented and original director who picked up a peculiar subject and made it brilliant? Who is this impostor who does nothing but perfectly fine movie remakes? A person can? If you want to see Solaris, a very good movie was made in the Soviet Union in the 1970s. It was mysterious and tragic and at the same time hopeful. All the qualities of the 2002 version lack. Characters are merged. Families obliterated. George Cloony may be a handsome face, but any demanding character is beyond him. Solaris is far from sutilizing a project for it. He needs much more obvious roles to really shine.'",0
"b""I'm usually a proponent of Tyler Perry's productions. Thus, the pieces and the TV programs. The movies, for some reason, never do that for me. Because I got married it was not bad. The sequel to me failed miserably. On the one hand the intense comic relief along with the supercharged drama does not mix well for me (for example, Madea Goes to Jail - the movie). The plot was very predictable, ex wants the ex-husband, husband and wife are not happy, they discuss and tragically one dies ... meehhhh .... oh, let's not mention, one has cancer and is not dealt with in a way some other than when it is mentioned. It looked like a lot of recycled movie scenes, all together. Hmm, I just did not sit well with me. Excuse .""",0
"b'This movie was not good! You did not follow the book for a second! I thought this movie would be like the book I read in high school, but it sucked! It was as if they did not care enough about the central points that made the book work in the first place. I feel like the movie fooled me because the characters did not connect to the book! First of all, there is Agnes Bruckner, who played Vivian. She did not look anything like ""Vivian"" in the book, her schedule and motivation were not the same, her personality was completely different from the book, her performance in the film was poor because Agnes was no longer the character of the time. The script was very old and terrible! My imagination yearned for more drama and precision. The redheaded woman who played Esme \'underestimated the character (for whom she was the most important villain in the book). Everyone is acting in this movie was very flat in general! Whatever you do, avoid this movie like the plague! This movie was neither scary nor intelligent. For those of you who loved the book, DO NOT UNDERSTAND with the movie because it\'s a dead end!'",0
"b""This series of detectives in particular is above the amount of whodunnits. There are just another series of detectives in your class that come to mind - and this is the Sherlock Holmes series that starred the wonderful Jeremy Brett. There's something very interesting about the relationship between Lynley and Havers. It is always strictly platonic and professional, and yet it is something more ... a friendship. I affectionately refer to Havers as the wife of Lynleys' work. Those familiar with the series and the newcomers will find that to some extent this is true. Friendship aside, there's a lot of hard work as a detective on this show. I like brainstorming sessions from Lynley and Havers and even their arguments, which can be blunt. I have to mention one word about actor Sharon Small. Needless to say that Mrs. Small fits perfectly into the role of Havers, it's almost unbelievable. Overall, this is a high-quality and very entertaining detective series, which appears only once in a while.""",1
"b'Former government agent Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) must solve the mystery behind events that happened when he was a child, in order to save the planet from being destroyed by monsters of another dimension.OK, I admit, ""Alone in the Dark ""is not on my list of best movies of all time, but it\'s not on my list of movies either. It may be directed by Uwe Boll, who is considered by many to be the worst director of all time, but if all of Boll\'s other films are so, then Boll has been grossly underestimated because I have seen many movies. which are much worse than this (for example, ""The remake of Stepford Wives""). The script is based on a videogame, which gives you that ""video game"", moving from level to level, I feel that you started with many such movies (like ""Resident Evil"" or ""Doom""), but that did not deter me both of the film made me want to go out and play the game. Not being a player, this was my first encounter with ""Alone in the Dark"", and I found the story interesting enough to keep my interest in the length of the movie. The performance is uneven in quality. Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff (as another government agent) both perform in decent performances, but Tara Reid is as unconvincing as a scientist that she really contributes to the movie\'s entertainment value. My main criticism is that some of the battle scenes are very long. There is a fight scene at the 1 hour mark which comprises about 15 minutes of people shooting at monsters with very little dialogue, which became tedious after a while. Despite this, I still liked the movie and would be prepared to watch it again.'",0

"b'This is a masterpiece from an inspirational John Landis movie that does a topic dozens of times before - lycanthropy - and adds a bit of sauce and seasoning to the kettle. Here we have a werewolf movie with adventure, black comedy, a little flesh [both pressed together and torn in pieces of blood], laughter, ""oh my gods"" and even pathos. This is a great imaginative and inventive film with great special effects that you will never forget, as I have not seen since I saw it on screen at 81. It starts with a couple of young Americans backpacking through the scary European countryside at night. I love the scene where they enter a pub and are welcomed like the plague. Both leave the scene and are quickly attacked by a werewolf with one face being beaten to death and the other, David Naughton, who plays David, surviving only to become a murderous werewolf. All hell breaks loose from then on, when David falls in love during the day, he kills at night and constantly bumps into his backpack mate ""with his back to the dead,"" Jack - with bruised, torn flesh. Great shrinkage and laughter, as with each of Jack\'s post-mortem appearances, he is increasingly deteriorated until, in the end, he is nothing but skull and fascia. The scene in the theater, when Jack introduces David to each of his dead and devoured victims, complete with holes and missing limbs, is a beauty. The transformation scene where David transforms into a werewolf in his living room is absolutely amazing and unforgettable - this is a classic horror scene of all time. Congratulations to the special effects and makeup professionals here. GREAT John Landis cinematographic production with refreshing originality and a wonderful and astute variation of a stereotyped horror theme. Sorry Naughton did not become the star he should have. If you have not seen this you should before the next full moon. Lon Chaney Jr would have been proud of these guys.'",1

"b""We acquired this collection because we wanted to own the 1935 version of A Tale of Two Cities. We just watched and had a wonderful experience. The film is very close to the plot, the performances are excellent. Charles Dickens's book will forever be a testimony to the struggle of humanity between those who have and those who do not. Blanche Yurka's performance as Madame DeFarge is excellent. The citizens of France, seeking to put an end to the tyranny they experience of the oppressive aristocracy, present the endless example that, when rights are trampled, it always ends in revolution and change. The Marquis St. Evremonde, played by Basil Rathbone, offers a vision of the horror it represents for anyone to show that they do not care about those who suffer. Especially when it comes to children; by the horror committed against this family, ignites the fire that leads to events that put an end to the dominant society. Manette's performance as the innocent who has been a prisoner of the Bastille for over 18 years is superb. His daughter, played by Elizabeth Allen, represents the person who inspires great love in two men, one Charles Darnay and the Sydney Carton, superbly interpreted by Ronald Colman. The character of Miss Pross, played by Edna May Oliver, is incredible. We're going to dislike her, to admire her and then to love her for her sacrifice that saves Ms. Manette. In the end, the sacrifice made by Sydney for Lucie's love is one of the most sensitive and touching of all love stories. He finds a purpose for his life, knowing full well that his actions will live forever in the hearts of those for whom he sacrifices himself. I would highly recommend owning this DVD. The other films will be reviewed as we see them.""",1

"b""This fun and fun caper of crime has a great cast and a lot of south-frontier flavor that makes it a fun 88 minutes in the movies. William A. Seiter's Borderline is a cool little movie that has more in common with The Big Steal than the noir movie that is often advertised. It's a mix of humor, crime and fun that grows in you over and over until your moody end. It seems both L.A.P.D. and the US Treasury wants to stop a narco-trafficker from bringing narcotics along the border with Mexico. Claire Trevor is the enthusiast of police officer Madeline Haley, ex-O.S.S. agent who talks about the task of going south in an attempt to get information on the distasteful middleman Pete Ritche, hoping this will lead them to Mr. Great. Perry Mason's TV, Raymond Burr, is the heavyweight in the white suit, Ritche, and plays the role with menace. Madeline kind of stumbles on Ritchie, but before she can figure something out, Johnny Mackland, an unknown player working for the LA connection, steals Ritchie's gold so he can make a deal for the next shipment. He ends up taking Madeline with him after the weapons are taken and the pursuit continues. The persecution by Mexico, as they try to avoid Ritchie and deceive the cops, is a lot of fun. Madeline and Johnny start telling each other tall stories and warming each other along the way. When Johnny's friend Miguel is shot, they have a body in their hands to deal with, further complicating the pursuit. Fred MacMurray is good as Johnny, the cop who does not know that Madeline is a cop, who does not know he's a cop! Kind of like a fun pulp movie with more flavor than a habanero pepper, Trevor does a cute performance when he starts liking Johnny, even getting a bit jealous of the cute and pretty daughter of a not-so-clever Mexican cop. Unknowingly, it helps them get a plane to Encinada for the big deal. Like the two near the border, each repents having transformed the other because they fell in love with each other. When they straighten up who they work for, an exciting shootout with Ritchie and his gang culminates in a great ending to this very entertaining movie. A movie that means entertainment, does not take itself too seriously, and you should not either. Genre movie fans like this will like to go south of the border with this.""",1
"b""I watched the movie and felt that I was missing pieces, that the scenes were shorter, even that entire scenes were missing, but it had been so long since I watched that I thought I remembered the movie being better than it really was. So I watched the director's comment. It took at least 15 minutes from the movie. Most directors add to the film when given a chance, and it does not take away from it. The Director's Son created a fragmentary film, very different from the original, with humor and plot. After years of waiting for the release of Erik the Viking, I was extremely disappointed and a bit annoyed at how they treated one of my favorite movies. . I hope to see the Theatrical Version available sometime in the near future as I do not think I'll be watching the Director's Son's Cut again, and I certainly will not be sharing this version of the movie with friends and family like I had originally planned .""",0
"b'If you have not read the book yet, you\'re missing a lot of information to understand what\'s going on in the movie.

I have some objections to the film, first of course it leaves out some very important facts explained. in the book, according to the script of the film has some differences with the original romance of Dan Brown: - At the beginning of the film you find Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) signing his book at an event in Paris, while in the novel the book was still published. In connection with this scene, the French Police chose him at this event to go to the Louvre, while at the Novel it was very late and he was sleeping in the Hotel. - The whole escape from the Louvre was much more exciting. the book, and was simplified in the film. - The suspicion of conspiracy between the Vatican and Opus Dei has some twists in the book, and it was totally change in the film. The relationship between the Vatican and the Opus Dei group is described in more detail. ""There\'s a lot of missing information about Silas, the albino monk. - Getting the Swiss bank safe was much more interesting in the book. was an additional Criptek in the book.- There are other crucial differences in relation to the middle and the end of the film, but I do not want to mention then, because if you did not read the book or it looks like the movie I will ruin the suspense for you.Finally , read the book, watch the movie, do not listen to the critics, ... ..

I was more than right. Unless you\'re interested in a girl who is so terrible that makes you laugh, DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE! It\'s a total disaster! The film Rayne is nothing like its equivalent in the video game. The fight scenes were slow, nothing like the fluidity of the game. And do not get me started on the blood ... I\'ve seen better settings in a haunted house. Nothing was done realistically, and the ten-minute recap at the end of the movie (which was made for some reason I\'ll never understand) just shows how sloppy it is. The performance was not great either, and the short sex scene ... let\'s just say I\'ve been laughing for most of this mess. No need for day, the plot was also missing (and this is putting everything lightly). If you want a vampire movie, choose the ""Underworld"" movies. If you are a fan of BloodRayne looking for something to satisfy your fandom, play the game again. You will have more satisfaction with this than with this awful interpretation.'",0

"b'I\'ve said that before, and I\'ll repeat: studios need to stop letting little amateur producers release their movies on DVD. This Laurel & Hardy DVD is a great example of why. The most obvious and infuriating problem is that the soundtrack is not synchronized with the action; is about 2 seconds ago. Unless you like ""the boys"" look like a nicknamed Japanese movie, it will drive you crazy. Image quality is also very poor; I have a VHS copy of `` Flying Deuces \'\' which looks better than that. The trivia game was a good idea, but poorly executed; `` What color is Stan Laurel\'s hair? \'\' As I would know - all of their films are in BLACK AND WHITE!

"b'The acting in this movie stinks, laughable. Even Tara Reid can not save this movie. What, Reid is a scientist because he puts on glasses? She looks more like a fitness trainer. Is Christian Slater smarter? The direction is almost as bad as some of Ed Wood\'s films. The film may have had a science fiction plan, but the film hardly explored any part of its plot. The movie is not only bad, it\'s sometimes annoying, just spurred on by the fun of horribly executed script lines and mindless actions. Primarily, this movie incriminates its director. I give this movie two stars out of five. This movie had at least some visuals. I do not hate your stupidity as much as the other video game-based movie, ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse,"" which I consider the worst movie of its year.'",0

Now, I can go along with Deason, and I rotate it with the strength and flexibility portions of the Yoga Conditioning DVD for Athletes (also good!), And the Power of Burn by Rodney Yee.

"b""I had read all the reviews and thought that the bad guys were just people who had not made enough effort but believe me I tried very hard. I still can not master the first dance, and I've tried for over two weeks. When Tracy does the dance at full pace, it does not seem to match the moves she broke for you to learn. They are only minor differences and I am sure that someone with better dance experience or more coordination may be able to do them. I think if anyone could master the moves it would be great and therefore I'm really disappointed that I have not been able to get acquainted with it. However, I also got the treadmill workout and your post-pregnancy dvd and both are brilliant . Obviously, they are not cardio, but they are very good at toning their problem spots.""",0
"b""First of all ; I like Troma movies. I'm not ashamed of it either. I like science fiction. I even thought watching `` The Postman '' was a decent way to spend a Thursday night. But this ... Battlefield Earth has created the strangest atmosphere in my living room. The usual comments never arrived. People just stared at each other with an empty, sad look in their eyes. It's not even funny. The only funny part is that John Travolta tried to make this movie for a decade ... I do not understand why they had a list of actors cast in the credits. You see, they do not even say the name of most characters. Not until they die anyway. And in the end, when they get together and say `` Carlo did it! `` You do not even know who Carlo was or what the poor boy really did. As for credibility, well, I mean, it's science fiction. It's ok . You do not watch Sci-Fi for it. But I still have to quote this line from the movie: Caveman in a military flight simulator: '' You're right! It's like riding a horse! `` It's good that it's that easy, because otherwise the ID4-style air-to-air combat scene a week later would have been impossible. Well, what would you expect from a group of people who joined a cult started by a science fiction author? I will not say more than that.""",0
"b'This is the first time I\'m reviewing anything on the web, but I felt I needed to comment on this movie. Obviously, the movie, as Homer Simpson would say, is the most sucked drug ever sucked. Virtually everything that Uwe Boll, known as ""Toilet Boll"", drives to hell. Being able to watch a movie from that director would be drunk, drugged or both. Even so, it may not be enough. The good news is to use your films as an instrument of torture for terrorists. Someone suggested that the only thing Boll should direct is a pornographic movie. I beg to differ . I\'m sure he\'ll find some way to ruin that, too. He would probably concentrate on the man\'s limb instead of the woman\'s. No, the only thing Boll should direct was the end of his career. What is incredibly fun about this movie is the comments of this site and the critics about rottentomatoes. As I read, I began to laugh on several occasions for a few minutes. The comment from a previous review of how prostitutes in the film were real Romanian prostitutes is a riot. I will not even dive into the plot since it is inconsequential, so for all those who have not yet watched the movie, do yourself a favor and just read the reviews. It\'s a lot more fun and definitely will make you laugh out loud.'",0
"b'A Faustian tour through the postwar New York and Louisiana, \'Angel Heart\' tells a very old story from a surprisingly original and wonderfully creepy angle. The plot, focusing on the case of a person who is increasingly violent, is fairly simple, but the story that sets it apart is extraordinarily complex. When you go back the pieces in the end, it makes sense, but only just. De Niro is superb as Louis Cyphre, the ""entrepreneur"" with some assurance to collect, infusing the role with the right balance of sarcastic humor and demonic threat. Mickey Rourke gives what will likely always be his best performance as Harry Angel, a war veteran in shock and disheveled P.I. The support cast is excellent, especially Charlotte Rampling as an occultist, and Lisa Bonet as a teenage voodoo witch. But the real star here is the writer / director Alan Parker. He has an extraordinary talent for the simple yet powerfully disturbing image: a slow zoom on the outer wall of a New York hotel; a New Year\'s Eve crowd in Times Square; a downward lift; a sweeping staircase; the rotating blades of a fan. These images are simple, cold, but positively filled with infernal threats. Trevor Jones\' music is the perfect accompaniment, his saxophones leaning madly on menacing rhythms and the ubiquitous pulsation of a pulsing heart. It\'s a completely disturbing marriage, which will be afraid to close around you with the same somber certainty as the fate of the protagonist.'",1

The producers released the same DVD, which BTW has little to do with the band, under several different titles, with different covers to steal the band's fans. a band with whom the producers have nothing to do. The cover does not give a clue that the Deftones are not on this DVD. I was also ripped off buying the same Muse DVD twice for producers who had nothing to do with the band. In the future I'll be reading the review of a music DVD. before buying from a music store. This kind of crap only serves to harm bands, music stores, and the music industry in general.

"b""I bought this DVD from Amazon, remember, although it may not seem like it, because I recently changed my email address and received another account. Anyway, I almost never write more than 3 or 4 line comments, but this is one of those rare exceptions. I watched this movie for the second time a few days ago and, oddly enough, the impact was even greater than the first time. It keeps ringing in my head all day. Some details that escaped I noticed now. Despite what some people may say, I can not think of anything more beautiful and pure than the love the boy obviously felt for his soldier. Reading some comments, I tend to agree with many of them. They say they were extremely sad. One woman said she wanted to put the boy on her lap and say her prince would come back. Another guy said he wondered if the soldier really knew how much the boy loved him. Rudi Van Dantzig died in January of this year, and someone said that now he would finally find his soldier. Touching. They say the book is not so romantic. Well, I could not read, but judging by the film, it's hard to imagine someone who would not want to live such a intense romance, though short and indifferent. The reason for the unfortunate ending will always remain a mystery, and this, in my opinion, increases the magic. I will not repeat here what was said about the actors. They are very good. However, a special note about the boy and the soldier: they are really convincing, and sometimes you even get the impression that they are really liking. The boy has the kind of unusual and transient beauty you see once in a lifetime. His eyes look sad even as he smiles. Of course there will always be those who are ready to criticize you, but that is to be expected. Let's face it: some things are not for everyone. Technically speaking, my only complaint is that, unfortunately, the picture quality is not superior, but the film itself more than makes up for that. And I'm going to watch it again! ! !""",1
"b""It's hard to find words to begin to describe this fantastic show. First of all, the writing is superb. There are elements of this story that make the viewer jump online or access the local library for more information on what is presented. There is a wealth of narrative that is not always seen on television today. For every thing we are told, there are about twenty things we are not told ... which really involve the viewer in the program. It encourages active viewing, speculation, discussion and research, among other things. This is not to say that you can not just watch the show and get a supreme level of enjoyment. In the first season, I was an almost active viewer, and still thought it was the best show I had ever seen. The images that the dialogue creates are unbelievable. And of course, what's great writing without great talent to deliver the lines? On the front line, there are powerful actors like Clancy Brown, like confused brother Justin, and Nick Stahl, as the quiet and intriguing Ben Hawkins. Seeing the seemingly disconnected stories between these two characters evolve is an incredible event. The show also features Tim DeKay, Clea Duvall, Cynthia Ettinger, Amy Madigan, Michael J. Anderson, Toby Huss, Brian Turk, Adrienne Barbeau, John Savage and even Pa Walton, Ralph Waite. If anyone is a fan of any of these actors, their talents are highlighted in this series. Emotions increase throughout the first season and these actors know exactly how to portray them. And what's so great about writing and acting beautifully without a spectacular crash for action to take place? From the sandstorms of Dustbowl Oklahoma to the beautiful rural side of California, each set is perfect. The eyes receive beautiful images to absorb. Finally, and more importantly, the simple involvement of stor alone. As I mentioned earlier, this program makes an active viewer. If you've ever believed, for a moment, in the age of wonders ... the magic of the past ... this series definitely worth the money. Elements of our daily lives are questioned, and an entirely new world is created before their eyes. I challenge all the people who buy the first season DVDs to watch only one episode at a time. Look at one and wait a week before seeing another. Bet you do not know. You'll be eager to see what happens next. If you do not think this was possible with a television show, remember ... it 's not television ... it' s HBO.""",1

"b'I have to admit with some shame that before this movie, I did not know who Harvey Pekar was. But that did not limit my ability to enjoy this movie, which was one of the most interesting I have seen in a long time. The theme of the film as a whole is brilliantly summed up in the first few seconds of the film. Several boys go to a house on Halloween, all dressed up as Super Heroes, except for a boy, who is dressed just like himself: Harvey Pekar. The film as a whole is about Pekar\'s attempt to tell his mundane, monotonous and disappointing life in a comic book. Instead of a comic book about superheroes, he envisioned a comic book about him, an archivist at Veterans Hospital in Cleveland. The film tells the story of Pekar\'s life in varying degrees of detail, highlighting his encounter with R. Crumb in the 1960s and Crumb inspiring him to start a comic book, despite his inability to draw. By picking up incidents from his own life, involving his friends and colleagues, designing comic books, and then hiring artists to illustrate his stories (many of Crumb\'s own), Pekar manages to create something unique, funny, and in and of itself. Strange, triumphant and beautiful. The movie implies that we can all be the heroes of our own story. Not much happens in the movie, but it manages to be fascinating nonetheless. The big events in the narrative are Pekar\'s encounter with R. Crumb, his decision to write his own magazine, meet his wife, a series of appearances in the late 1980s on the Dave Letterman Show, and his fight against cancer. For all this, there is no attempt to make Pekar look better than he. He is described as physically uninteresting, a little strange, a chronic failure, more than a little neurotic and extremely egocentric. But despite all this, there is an honesty in looking at his life and portraying it as it is, warts and everything else. The way he deals with everything with an indefatigable sense of humor and his determination to do something to give a focus and purpose to his life is heroic in a very real and concrete way, as opposed to the fictitious false heroism of Superman, Batman, or the Green Lantern. It would be difficult to overdo Paul Giamatti by playing Harvey Pekar or Hope Davis by playing Joyce Brabner, the woman who marries Pekar. Both the real Pekar and the real Brabner also appear on the camera, as do most of the real-life models for the Pekar characters. In fact, the way the film\'s narrative flows seamlessly between real-life individuals, actors, and comic book representations is one of the film\'s strengths. In one scene, Paul Giamatti playing Pekar and Judah Friedlander playing Pekar\'s friend (and MTV\'s smallest celebrity) Toby Radloff are onscreen while the real Harvey Pekar and Toby Radloff talk. In another part of the film, Hope Davis and Paul Giamatti are supposedly behind the scenes of Dave Letterman\'s show, but when Giamatti leaves the stage with Letterman, Giamatti cuts to pictures of the real Pekar being interviewed by Letterman. I remembered Margritte\'s famous painting, where he has a painting of a pipe with the words ""This is not a pipe"" below. By switching from true Pekar to an actor who plays him, it\'s a way of saying ""this is not Harvey Pekar"" whenever Giamatti is on the screen. In addition, it implies that Giamatti is a cinematographic equivalent of the several Pekars drawn in the comic books. This is a great movie, and I hope you get the attention it deserves. It\'s very different from the CRUMB movie, but I imagine it\'s especially appealing to those who enjoyed that weird but fascinating documentary.'",1
"b'I will not rip Hilary Duff as a previous commenter because I really think she was the best part of this movie, hence the only star. It\'s fun and feminine, but I could not enjoy it because of the constant stereotypes (ie. Blonde girl enters the business world and knows nothing other than how to use color as well as how consistent the female characters judge the men by their ""hot sit-ups"" or ""tight asses."" It just seems a bit sexist in terms of male and female characters, and although I know most girls\' films are to a certain extent, it\'s never been so big that I felt The characters in Lane\'s other characters are very bad and made of wood, including the ones that are not really British, but they are very bad. her best friend and more or less all the people she works with.The story, I think, is cheerful and cute, but if you have an ounce of intellect and do not assume that all women are bi mbos, whose specialty subject is the coats and the value of men is evaluated by the tightness of their loaves, I suggest looking elsewhere. I was also a bit worried about the sexual references (ie painting each other\'s bodies with chocolate and then \'burning\' after a date, talking about climax etc.). Surely this is a bit much for a younger audience?'",0
"b""I believe the waitress's excellence is all by herself, but my desire to like it was undoubtedly heightened by the post-production tragedy of the murder of writer / director Adrienne Shelly. I think co-star Cheryl Hines says it's better on the featurette: Shelly's tragic, pointless death drives you to watch the movie through a different prism. I was surprised that Keri Russell was not nominated for any award for best actress. I thought she was excellent. She's in every scene. His performance carries the film. It's actually a series of interactions between her and her husband Earl (a wonderfully unpleasant Jeremy Sisto), she and the client / owner Old Joe (a dyspeptic Andy Griffith) and she and the doctor / pretender Dr. Pomatter. In particular, the relationship between Russell's Jenna and Nathan Fillion's Pomatter is very well interpreted, both by the actors themselves and by Shelly's strong writing and direction. She'll miss you.""",1
"b""Beverly Hills Cop did not need presentations. It was one of the best action comedies of 1984. It helped bring Eddie Murphy to the mainstream and reigned in 1984. Beverly Hills Cop II was very good. A little over the top but still fun. It complemented Tony Scott's film-making style and also captured the essence of the 1980s. This monstrosity is instantly forgettable from start to finish. A bust is terribly wrong and Inspector Todd (Gilbert R Hill) is killed. Axel (Eddie Murphy) traces the killer known as Ellis De Wald (Timothy Carhart) to a tacky Disney knock-off called Wonderworld, where Ellis De Wald is the supervisor. Where do I start first? Axel Foley does not even feel like Axel Foley (like Big Top Pee Wee is different from Pee Wee of Big Adventure). Eddie spends the entire movie looking like he can not understand what his character should be. Gone is the tenacious but silly cop who angered his target. He is replaced by a guy who is so relaxed in his behavior that it gets annoying to watch after a while. The only characters to return are Inspector Todd (but he is killed in the beginning) and Rosewood (Judge Reinhold). Taggart is gone and so is the sergeant. Bogomil. That was the hint that this movie was DOA. The first two BHC movies had good villains considering the length of time. Victor Maitland and The Alphabet Killer were good villains, but Ellis De Wald is horrible. No disrespect for Timothy Carhart, but he was very weak and his work plan was weak and laziness on behalf of the writers. Using an amusement park to make fake money? The film is rarely funny and bringing back Serge (Bronson Pinochet) was an inexpensive attempt to remind us of the first interaction Serge and Axel Foley had in the first film. There is a moment of redemption in this film: the malfunctioning sequence of the park where Axel saves two children. This scene is the only reason I gave two stars. The mood is most often forced and if you ever listen to this boring theme song for Wonderworld it will be too soon. Who thought it was a fun plot device anyway? In conclusion, this movie killed a promising series. It's a shame that the same director (John Landis) behind Animal House, Blues Brothers, Coming To America and some of my favorite movies are behind this mess. John Landis is a great director, but not a great director for this kind of film. Thumbs down.""",0

"b'In movies, as in most other art forms, most works usually come in the smallest of packages. Such is the case of ""The Five Senses,"" an independent Canadian production that chooses for its subject no less than a meditation on what it means to be human. Writer / Director Jeremy Podeswa has created a poetic and insightful work centered on a group of people who share the universal need to find true love and acceptance in a world where hurt and destroyed relationships often result in greater loneliness and despair. Like all of us, each of these characters tends toward the dual goals of intimacy with others and acceptance of self that are essential to human happiness. Some succeed while others fail - just as in life - but none of the characters is left untouched by experience. ""The Five Senses"", although it has a plot, is more a piece of emotional humor than a narrative drama. Blessed with an excellent cast, Podeswa is able to draw us into the center of his world through the use of sensory images and methodical and deliberate rhythm. In fact, one of the film\'s strongest themes is the examination of the role our senses play in defining our world and character. Podeswa understands that we become insensitive to our senses. As a result, he uses this film to reconnect us to the crucial element of our beings. The quiet, quiet tone, the soft autumnal colors, the sluggish camera, the astonishing soundtrack combine to create an atmosphere in which the audience can become aware of every sight and sound that comes our way. In our effort to establish meaningful intimacy with other human beings, we usually rely on the sense of touch - but this can serve, Podeswa tells us, both to imprison us in false intimacy and to lead us to one that is genuine. and long-lasting. Some of his characters use sex as a substitute for true closeness, while others make a physical connection on a much deeper level. One of the most touching moments in the movie comes when a gay man - probably an AIDS patient - falls apart in tears during a massage session, heartbroken because no one has dared touch him in such a long time. This film recognizes the vital part that sensitive physical contact plays in the totality of a person\'s humanity. Similarly, the film explores the beauty of sound as one of the characters - ironically, an ophthalmologist, a man dedicated to preserving the organ of a sense - faces the prospect of imminent deafness and yearns to create a mental catalog of all sounds of everyday life that he will soon be unable to hear and which we routinely take for granted. However, like all other characters, it is their spiritual emptiness and inability to make a meaningful connection with another human being who brings their greatest obstacles to happiness. Podeswa also examines the part that smell plays in making this vital human connection, as one of the characters - a lonely gay man - revisits his former lovers to smell them in an effort to find out if he can smell ""true love"" . ""Yet` `The Five Senses \'\' is not merely a movie built on an intelligent device. Rather, it breathes in the fullness of humanity, because each of its many characters emerges as a fully developed and instantly recognizable human being. There are adolescents alienated by their own inability to fit into the norm accepted by society and feel guilty for their acts of careless irresponsibility. There are mothers terrified of the loss of their children in one case, literally when their youngster disappears and disappears and, in another case, figuratively, while her teenage daughter seems to be creeping into inexplicable ""strangeness."" ""There are adults unable to comprehend a life filled with failed relationships that attack in desperation for that last chance for happiness, often with the result that they go further than the universally desired goal than ever before. One of the more daring aspects of ""The Five Senses"" is that he does not succumb to the temptation to provide a ""happy"" or even conclusive ending for all his characters. The film recognizes that life is a confusing and endless process of changing fortunes and personal growth and remains true to that theme to the end. This brave, haunting and mesmerizing film definitely stands out as one of the real finds of recent movies. a real work of art!'",1

"b'""The Exorcist,"" along with such films as Rosemary\'s Baby, The Shining and The Ring, stand out as some of the greatest horror films of all time. Not only were they great movies themselves, but they ""broke the rules"" and opened up new avenues. This DVD contains many deleted scenes and behind the scenes watch the production of the film. I know I heard that after a movie screening a few months before the release, some screen executives thought the movie should not be released. It was very scary. When you really watch the movie for the first time, you will be truly scared ... ... if you take it deeply. Some people remember the ""pea soup"" incident, but this movie did not use the blood to show what it wanted. Like the other movies listed above, he used clever pictures, dialogues and symbols to make his points. Most people who read this review know that the story was based on a case in 1947 when a 13-year-old boy should have been possessed. . Obviously, some details have been changed for the film. I would like to see a movie from the ""true"" story of 1947, in which no name is revealed, but the facts of the case are presented. The Exorcist really deserves all 5 stars. Perhaps more writers and filmmakers today should come back and watch it before attempting to make another foolish teen movie that calls itself a horror film.'",1

Ways that are all poorly presented: Johnny is killed in a convenient tank of piranhas, the head of another is found under an aluminum foil in a tray in the refrigerator, a couple is killed by electrocution in bed, one is shot in the head, etc. There are additional features like Carradine making an adult dress up as an organ grinder monkey, free ax for the action of the head (one of the worst special effects ever), voracious insects, whipping, a servant named Igor, and overcoming the likes of which are rarely seen. it will end in the middle of the movie. A special mention goes to the final line of the film directed directly to the public ""And I bet you thought I was the butler all the time."" Also of extreme annoyance value is the closing song, which borders the unlistenable. I gave this film two stars (generously) for John Carradine\'s smaller, albeit hilarious, performance.

David Dortort, the creator of Bonanza gave interesting interviews as well. I especially liked his interview called ""Remembering Pernell Roberts"".

Spock recognizes this as a form of the death penalty used in Vulcan centuries earlier, preferred by his speed and painless delivery. A method called Tal-Shaya, well known to his father. An interesting detail is that the Romulan equivalent of the KGB is called Tal-Shayar in the next generation episodes - the Romulans are distant cousins \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bof the Vulcans and their languages \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bno doubt have common roots ... perhaps the English translation of the Tal-Shayar is `` the murderers of the neck \'\'? Anyhoo, Sarek is thought to be a suspect, but is eliminated when it is obvious that a defective heart valve has been keeping him out of commission. A risky operation requires Spock, the only Vulcan on board with the same T-negative blood type, to deliver almost half of his blood during a transfusion. Why they could not have a beer a day is beyond me. Spock prepares to be the source of blood for his father when Kirk is attacked by an Andorian. The Andorian clearly stabs Kirk on the lower back, near his kidneys in the attack just before Kirk kicks him back and knocks him cold. Kirk reaches to the side and pulls a bloody hand and uses the wall intercom to call for help before losing consciousness. In the infirmary we see Kirk with a bandage around his bare chest. Now we are told that his lung was pierced and that the Andorian barely felt heart failure. Considering he was using a small knife that could not have hit from his butt to his heart, I think they should have re-filmed the fight scene, but that\'s just me. It is as if the lung injury were a later thought of the battle scene and perhaps the writers felt that the public would not ""catch"" a kidney injury in the same way that they would understand how a lung injury would take their breath away. And that\'s fine. Bad continuity in those scenes, anyway. Spock suddenly refuses to help in his father\'s surgery. He must instead command the Enterprise because there was a murder on board the Enterprise, an assassination attempt, discussions between the delegates, and an unidentified alien vessel chased them, just beyond the reach of their sensors and weapons. Kirk, disoriented, wakes up at Sick Bay, he told the news and needs to find a way to put Spock on the operating table without violating Federation regulations and Vulcan\'s stubborn oath on duty and logic. A subsequent interrogation and a search for the Andorian who attacked Kirk results in some interesting discoveries that will take him to the limit of his seat. Despite being a bit of cheese here and there, this is one of the most exciting episodes of the old series. An excellent show.'",1
"b'Stephen King is best known for his macabre books, but what some people do not know, is that he is also a master of comedy - as is the case with ""The Langoliers."" complex and hilarious study of the human mind. The film delves deeper, showing how funny people can be when confronted with the imminent destruction. Both the film and the book ask the question, ""What would you do if you fell asleep on an airplane, but everyone who was awake died?"" and that one of the people on your plane is a psychopath, and another is a blind girl who can sense evil, like Haley Joel Osment in ""The Sixth Sense"", so you seek shelter at an airport, but all carbonated drinks are flat and the food is spoiled, then you find out that these Pac-Man-like creatures (""the Langoliers"") literally consume the past? `` Well, what would you do? It\'s a complicated question, and to be honest with you, I do not know what I would do. But I can say one thing, Bronson Pinchot (in a performance that is quite different from his beloved character Balki Bartokomous in the popular TV show, ""Perfect Strangers"") also does not know how to answer the question. Dude, he\'s crazy - and I\'m not talking about Riggs in `` Lethal Weapon \'\' - I mean, he really goes crazy. You can say that Pinchot really embraced that role for what it was and took the method to a whole new level. Still not convinced? After all the laughter and clowning routines (the scene where Dean Stockwell drinks the beer at the airport is absolutely brilliant!), You are led into a fantastic, suspenseful chase scene where the Langoliers chase the plane at high speed through escape Just as the plane is preparing to take off the sharp teeth of Langoliers ...

"b""This biopic, based on Take Me Home, an autobiography of John Denver, will be enjoyed by hardcore fans (like me), but it's still horrible in many ways. The story begins in the early 1960s, when John (Chad Lowe) begins his career as a folk singer. He meets Annie (Kristin Davis) on a show and falls in love with the place. They marry and move to Aspen, but when John's career takes off, tension increases in marriage. They divorce, he has a short second marriage, and he discovers his love for flying, something that finally earns the respect of his stern father (Gerald McRaney). This movie is a summary of John's life; is poorly written and amateurish and lacks depth or emotion. Lowe (who wears a hideous clown wig that makes him look like Dana Carvey in Waynes World), is shameless all the time, playing an innocent who never seems to grow up. (Actually, although the film covers thirty years, no one gets old.) Davis is very handsome, but the horrible script does not give him much of a chance to develop. McRaney plays the only character that seems real, and he is the villain of the play. The story is shallow and Lowe's Denver is not particularly nice. Her hair is so laughable and distracted that the movie has no chance. Although we hear Denver sing many of his songs, Lowe is lousy at synchronizing his lips. The DVD extras are useless; where are some pictures of the true JD we love?""",0

"b'Wish You Were Here was the follow-up album to Pink Floyds, the massively successful commercial album, Dark Side Of The Moon, which, among other great songs, contained perhaps its signature, ""Money."" Released in September 1975, Wish You Were Here is the favorite album of many band members as well as fans. When it hit the streets, it went straight to number one on the album charts, both in the UK and the US. In the first four notes - the basis of the song - this invokes a sadness, which was the story of Sy d Barrett. Recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London for several sessions. Although some of these sessions are problematic, it was Roger Waters\' idea to split the centerpiece ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"" in two and join each party with three new compositions. ""Shine On"" was a tribute to Barrett, who, coincidentally, made an impromptu visit to the studio while it was being recorded. Wish You Were Here is Pink Floyd\'s second conceptual album written entirely by Waters. This reflects his sense that the friendship that cemented the band was, at the time, practically absent. Deeply steeped in themes of absence, the greed of the music business and Barrett. The album begins with a long instrumental prelude and follows the lyrics of ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond,"" a tribute to Syd Barrett - whose mental breakdown forced him to leave the band several years earlier. Barrett is fondly remembered with phrases like ""Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun"" and ""You reached the secret too soon, you cried for the moon."" This simultaneous release on Blu-Ray and DVD is the authoritative history of the album and was made with the full involvement of the band members. The film is full of new interviews with Roger Waters, David Gilmour and Nick Mason and archives interviews with the late Richard Wright. Also included is cover designer Storm Thorgerson, guest vocalist Roy Harper and cover ""Ronnie Rondell"" and others involved in the album\'s production. Members of the band discuss the initial difficulties of the initial recordings and how The decision to split ""Shine On"" became the catalyst. Other interesting insights revealed through interviews are the fact that before Barrett left the band, he virtually gave up or abandoned the desire to make ""hit"" music. he did not want to make music for `` Top Of The Pops \'\' and, ironically, band members have blamed the greed of the music industry on themselves as the main impetuous for wanting to make music more commercially acceptable, if not exactly "" pop "". The movie is also full of excerpts from concerts and performances as well as parts of the band working on the parts.Pink Floyd: The Story of Wish You Were Here is a fascinating and appropriate documentary to honor the band in creating the masterwork album. For casual fans and collectors and musicologists, this is one that you will want to add to your collection. if you\'re an aspiring musician, then you\'ll play it over and over again just to take a look at the creative concept. Syd Barrett has performed in music for only seven years, recording four singles, Pink Floyd\'s debut album The Piper , in the Gates of Dawn (and contributed to the second), in addition to several songs unpublished with Pink Floyd. In 1969, Barrett released a solo single, ""Octopus,"" which prefigured his first solo album, The Madcap Laughs (1970), which was recorded over the course of a year (1968-1969) with four different producers including David Gilmour and Roger Waters. Nearly two months after the release of Madcaps, Barrett began work on his second album, Barrett, produced by Gilmour and Richard Wright, which was to be released in the late 1970s, before entering self-imposed seclusion for more than thirty years. Barrett\'s innovative guitar work and the exploration of experimental techniques such as dissonance, distortion, and feedback had a huge legacy not only in defining the direction that Floyd would take without him, but musicians from David Bowie to Brian Eno and Jimmy Page and more. suffering from diabetes for several years, Barrett died at his Cambridge home on July 7, 2006. He was 60 years old. The cause of death was pancreatic cancer. The occupation on his death certificate was given as a ""retired musician"". `` According to local newspapers, Barrett left about 1.7 million for his two brothers and two sisters. This amount was apparently purchased largely from Pink Floyd\'s royalties for compilations and live recordings with songs he had written while in the band. The Dirty Lowdown'",1

"b'It looked like this movie was targeted at this age group (13-16 years old) or the director / filmmaker where that old man when they did such crap. The director\'s comment changed my view of the first film, so I thought the director\'s comment would change my opinion on this. No, do not be so lucky. The acting was so bad it made me laugh out loud. The complete madness of the ""general"", making a total ass of himself and saying stupid and stupid things, made me say ""wow"" several times. The premise of the first film was to conclude that in the war, all governments eventually turn into fascist governments. When I say ""I become,"" I do not mean it literally. Only that they behave and produce these results. This came directly from the director\'s mouth during his comments and that\'s what he was trying to convey. I heard that comment (there are two of them - one from the filmmaker and one from the director / cast) I really did not get a clear picture of what they were trying to say. Of course there was the end where the director was saying that the state will use the religion to their benefit. If they interfere with it, they will try to eliminate it, if they think they can use it to an advantage, then they will. Regardless of these ""messages"" they were trying to convey, this was done in an amateurish and sloppy way. I give science fiction a lot of leeway when it comes to suspending belief, however I have limits. There was something that occurred to me and it could happen to you as well. How these people behaved would tend to make me believe that a highly advanced technological society could actually be extremely sloppy and inefficient. Anyone who has been in our own military (like me) would have thought of a million better ways to protect the base and combat those bugs. Even with our current weapons, our own military could overturn a volume of fire that would annihilate these insects. For a society that has been at war with these bugs in the last 10 years would have made any government fire the contractor or the advanced weapon division that continues to use those ineffective firearms that they use, Marauders in the end nonetheless. The level of insubordination in these troops is surprising, given the extreme threat and, in some cases, punishment. But I think that\'s part of the point; that a totalitarian society could indeed produce armies with highly dysfunctional methods and leadership. These are some of the things that come to mind, though you can get this from the first movie without wasting your time with that bad. I thought SST 2 was bad and I still think one is worse than this, but not much.'",0

The subtle nature of temptation is conveyed because he is not called to lose any game. just play badly enough so they're close. Marshall Thompson plays the lead role of Johnny Long.

"b'Louis Malle\'s Lacombe, Lucien still impresses, although he tends to crawl in the third act when you can expect him to tighten control. But it is still a casually powerful reminder of the less heroic side of France under Vichy\'s rule (the Nazis barely seen in the film), since its not very clever does almost accidentally in collaboration with the German Police composed entirely of his compatriots after being rejected by the Resistance. The main achievement of the film is to show, much like Fascism in general, the appeal that the collaboration had to dissatisfied and dissatisfied strangers in the community (only one of the \'cops\' is a true fanatic) and the attraction of undeserved and a power undeserved as Lucien thinks the power he has over people (particularly the implicit threat of surrendering his Jewish ""girlfriend"" - perhaps a little more symbolically called ""France"" - to the Germans) is far more intoxicating than killing mere animals. with Melville\'s masterpiece of resistance, L\'Armee des Ombres, there is a worldly sense of reality that adds to the drama. Situated in the quaint little village type that strangers find idyllic, but that is a tedious hell to live for the villagers, it shows how upset and opportunity are so much more a driving force than malice. Certainly far from being glamorous, your employees stay in a local hotel getting drunk and whining when the war news gets worse and worse (as you can tell, you have to listen to both German and British radio reports) and divide the difference \'\' to find the truth) and they are gradually caught up by the embattled locals. The only extra on Criterion\'s album is the imaginative theatrical trailer, so this may be worth catching on Criterion\'s set of boxes which also includes Au Revoir Les Enfants, Heart Murmur and an exclusive disc of extras focusing mainly on Louis Malle and not in the movies themselves.'",1
"b'Paul Verhoeven and Joe Eszterhas open their film with the last oxymoron of love and death: the moment of orgasm coincides with the moment of greatest agony and death. Never before has a movie character been killed at the height of orgasm. Never before has such a creative and controversial opening opened the view of the polarized audience of the first scene. Never before has movie orgasm reached such a scary, cynical, darkly humorous edge with every counter-penetration of the murder weapon. The very concept of ending the victim this way in the first few minutes of the film demonstrates the genius of the creators - and their ""poor"" taste. But this is just the beginning of a delightfully ironic, even entertaining dance. between life and death that forms the twists and turns of the Wild Instinct. In addition to analyzing a childish and simplistic film of sex and violence, a great film reaches emotional intensity as well with its ""looks"" carefully photographed and edited. ""scenes in which the characters look at each other in non-verbal communication attacks - and Wild Instinct scores 200 percent in this department."" Conquered by Verhoeven, cinematographer Jan De Bont and the cast itself, ""looks"" achieve a particularly good advantage when Curran and Gus meet Roxy for the first time on ""his and hers Picassos"" scene in the foyer, and then Verhoeven bets again on the scene by the ocean on the deck where Curran, Gus and Trammell meet for the first time. The cut and score score in this area is so beautiful that it hurts. This is certainly the best result of Jerry Goldsmith, whose power in all production is invaluable. Non-verbal looks are key, and it seems mixed with Joe Eszterhas\'s now-famous dialogue to make Wild Instinct such a coherent and vital, so crisp film A delightful friction of character that Wild Instinct is absolutely perfect - at least until the scene of violent sex between Curran and his psychotherapist, which I found unnecessary, but which adds a necessary touch of madness to Curran and Garner\'s relationship. The fact that this relationship is openly discussed in the department provides the final touch of contradiction and astringency. A great film stimulates all parts of the mind simultaneously, from the most intellectual to the most primitive, and Basic Instinct covers the entire spectrum by giving doses. of blood, emotionally satisfying character interaction and intellectually stimulating plot. Instinct is filled with classic and memorable scenes, but most scenes of sex and violence are definitely off the list. Verhoeven has to do it with taste and skill, of course. There are no mistakes here. But who cares how well they can make love or stab each other? It\'s the thing between violence, the fantastic interactions and concise dialogues of one of the best cast ever assembled, which makes the Wild Instinct so good. Particularly striking and satisfying is the scene with Dr. Lamott, Dr. Garner and the entire police team, who discusses the ambiguity and insanity of the film\'s basic themes with a brilliant backing of Goldsmith\'s underscore. Basic Instinct is the culmination of Michael Douglas\'s career - and Sharon Stone\'s career. In addition to Douglas\'s artistically sculpted expressions, let us not forget this fabulous voice. Douglas is simply amazing, and I\'ve never really enjoyed seeing a main character attacked by everyone in the cast, especially his own people. Note a performance particularly underrated by Denis Arndt as Lieutenant Walker, Curran\'s immediate supervisor, who provides a lack of support for Curran\'s ongoing investigation. If characters like Curran and Walker irritate, then Stone as Trammell is the best lubricant, nothing sticks to it, it can easily dodge from any situation. Basic Instinct dares to portray an invincible killer without guilt, without weakness, who as an antagonist overcomes Curran by seduction. I would finally like to touch on the beautiful and smooth movements of Jan De Bont\'s camera, which used in conjunction with long, uninterrupted , multi-character dialogue shots loaded with camera movement, elevate European style and make this one of the most visually pleasing movies to watch ever made, just in terms of pure camera movement. The interaction between camera and actors is electrifying in their vitality. I really liked Verhoeven and De Bont\'s commentary track on Blu Ray. In his craft alone, Wild Instinct goes far beyond the ordinary thriller to become the modern modern whodunit, against which all others must be measured. This movie will surpass the critics - the best film of Verhoeven, by far.'",1

"b'Robert Duvall shows some originality in this captivating film. I say captivating, I could not turn it off, the dialouge was very realistic almost with a documentary edge, the action while it was not flashy or excessive had realistic grain, and I had to wonder how this was going to end. Being an artistic end, you really do not know what will happen to our protagonist, killer in the end. I draw the original word in this work for a few reasons. The main character, ""John Anderson,"" played by Duvall (though the same character we\'ve seen him play before) is a killer with a difference, does not use much sexist posture to create this vulnerable, aged and somewhat regretted professional. . He does not repent of the ""works"" he performed, but which, as he approached the twilight of his life, established no real roots. However, he now has a girlfriend with a ten-year-old daughter, and his love and devotion to that child shines, as well as Duvall\'s love for Tango which is so wonderfully accomplished by the loving camera of very attractive Argentines. Young and old. The assassination plan is second to Tango for much of the film, and when Duvall brings us back to his purpose of being in Argentina, we feel as much as he has to leave that wonderful dance behind. There were a couple of times when Duvall\'s scenes might have been stricter, but I never felt they were too big negatives.

"b'Almost nine years after watching the film for the first time and almost 34 years since the events he inspired took place, the film ""Apollo 13"" looks even more captivating. The story of Apollo 13, for anyone who has followed the space program and especially those who have witnessed it, is a story as engrossing as it has been told throughout American history. It is filled with drama, intrigue, twists and thrills. What\'s more, everything really happened! In April 1970, the American public was already seeing the incredible landing landing on the Moon as it passed. and could not have cared less about the Apollo 13 mission. Interest was so apathetic that the astronaut conveyed when the ship was about to enter lunar orbit was not even broadcast on television. The fickle public certainly had their interest aroused when, not long after the broadcast, a simple house-cleaning maneuver (stirring in the oxygen tanks) exposed a fatal flaw that led to a tremendous explosion. This explosion caused Apollo 13 to lose control, put an end to hopes of landing on the Moon and left the fate of the three astronauts (Commander Jim Lovell, LM pilot Fred Haise, and command pilot Jack Swigert) in doubt. The heroic efforts made by Mission Control members, as well as the astronauts themselves, bring Apollo 13 back to Earth safely is one of the greatest stories ever told. Acclaimed director, Ron Howard, saw this and, inspired by Lovell. The own account of that mission created one of the truly majestic historical films that already arrived at the screen. ""Apollo 13"" is a true cinematic achievement. He rekindles the imagination and imagines that the space program happened in the 60s and early 70s. Using cutting-edge special effects in the service of history (as opposed to in place of it), Howard is able to give the public a close-up view of the entire Apollo mission. Using archive footage to create special effects scenes, the director is able to make the release look real, as if the viewer were standing at the top of the tower, watching the rocket about to take off. The scenes in space are well crafted and extraordinarily realistic. When astronauts are forced to shut off much of the lunar module, and the entire command module, to conserve power, the cold abjectness and helplessness that these men were forced to endure is felt by the public. The true mark of the greatness of this film is found in the fact that while we know from the story that the men of Apollo 13 survived, the final moments during re-entry, as depicted in the film, are still incredibly exciting and tense. So the emotional release that comes knowing they have done it is so overwhelming that even the most cynical, hard-hearted viewer will be suffocated by emotion. The narrative and effects of ""Apollo 13"" are great, but the movie would probably still have fallen if not for the huge cast hired to play those roles. Tom Hanks is solid as the undisturbed Jim Lovell, Bill Paxton (who always seems to find a way in every blockbuster) is good as the trusted but untested debutante Fred Haise, and Kevin Bacon gives a precise picture of last minute Jack replacement Swigert. Gary Sinise plays Ken Mattingly, Swigert the astronaut replaced due to fear of a measles infection, with appropriate melancholy. The other highlight is that of Ed Harris, who plays the rock of a flight director, Gene Kranz. Harris really deserved his Oscar nomination for this performance and there is certainly a strong case to be made for him to have won the award for Supporting Actor winner Kevin Spacey. Apollo 13, by itself, was a strong contender for Best Picture Award, second only to the valuable Braveheart. The only disconcerting question is why Ron Howard was omitted from the nominations for Best Director (he would have to wait another 7 years before receiving his due for ""A Brilliant Mind""). ""Apollo 13"" is not just a big suspense; it is also a lesson in telling history. This allows us to remember those wonderful days of the quest to reach the Moon, as well as the drama of that endangered flight. It is disheartening today to see how the space program has stagnated since those intoxicating days. Apollo 13 proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that we still have men with the will, the knowledge and the courage to take this space exploration to places beyond imagination.'",1

"b""In Barbra Walter's interview with Al Pacino several years ago, she said that this was Pacino's favorite role. But this movie stands by itself despite this proclamation.

Pacino plays a bandit of Cuban refugees, Tony Montana, who grabs and revolves (leading some lives along the way) to the top of the cocaine world in Miami with the help of his right arm Manny Ray (Steven Bauer). Pacino plays this role with so much passion and energy that he absolutely feeds this movie from start to finish. You can not take your eyes off the man. It adds humanistic dimensions to Tony Montana. It shows the humor, machismo, intelligence, leadership, courage and flaws of Montana. He even shows the tender side of Montana (the scene with Michelle Pfeiffer by the pool). Pacino really makes you like a character who is basically a sleezeball. Now that's acting! There are memorable moments throughout this movie and some are very graphics but what is probably the highlight of this movie is the great shoot'em up scene at the end; Sosa's assassins infiltrated the Montana estate to kill him because Montana made a big hit for Sosa. When Montana, full of cocaine, finally turns his attention to the killers, he retaliates in complete defiance of them with a machine gun / grenade launcher. & quot; Say hello to my little friend! & quot; is now one of those famous movie lines in the history of cinema. He detonates them as dominoes, resisting the incredible shootout because of the cocaine in his system. This is a true & quot; face 's & quot; scene. It's action fueled by high-octane adrenaline and Pacino plays beyond belief. Your performance is so exciting that you want to grab a machine gun and fight alongside it. Pacino It's Scarface! The DVD comes with great advantages such as theater trailers, production notes, cast and film biographies, the production of SCARFACE (with Pacino) and 10 outtakes of the film. The movie is letterboxed, but it is not digitally enhanced. It would have been nice to see the movie improved, but it does not detract from the experience of watching this movie. Actually, I do not care. IT'S SCARFACE!""",1
"b'When Bruce Lee moved in 1973, two films were brought together in an attempt to profit from Bruce Lee\'s craze, joining some of Lee\'s best moments in the Green Hornet series, and so doing 2 90 mins. ""Bruce Lee Films"" for the joy of those who were eager for Bruce Lee to shoot. The first was titled `` Green Hornet \'\', the second was curiously titled `` Fury of the Dragon. ""What we have here is the official sequence of the Green Hornet\'s first 90-minute feature. An identical approach in which production is composed of several scenes from the Green Hornet TV series ... and the result? Despite some good times and good memories of seeing Bruce Lee as a superhero and hearing his REAL voice, we were left with 90 minutes of splicing together of stories that do not mix. I even remember seeing some fight scenes from the first movie. If you ask me, what we have here is a shadow of what would come in 1978 ... the 20th Century Fox massacre about Bruce Lee\'s Death Game. The only difference was that they put together filming alone instead of playing in a double unconvincing with 10 minutes of actual footage. Anyway, this is a guardian for Bruce Lee fans, one that will be worth a lot in the near future. But still, I have to call the Green Hornet vol. 1 and Dragon Fury (Green Hornet Vol 2) which is ... BRUCEPLOITATION however. CAN WE PLEASE HAVE AN OFFICIAL GREEN HORNET BOX COLLECTION? THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO BUY THESE 2 EMPLOYMENTS IS ON THE BLACK MARKET AND DOES NOT STEAL. SOMEONE HELP A BROTHER OUT. I LAUGHED A LOT ! WARNING: Make sure your DVD player plays PAL discs before you buy this DVD.

"b'There seems to be some confusion between Amazon\'s reviews of this product. ""Death Mask"" is a low-budget horror film starring James Best (from the TV show ""The Dukes of Hazzard"") as Wilbur, a socially clumsy nerd who nurtures a frustrated love for women. Although he falls in love with Linnea Quigley, romantic feelings that are, at least in part, matched, Wilbur simultaneously clings to a beautiful mask of death that forces him (liberates him?) To become a killer. I can not say that I have an objective opinion about this movie - I\'m not a fan of the genre and I only got it because I went to school with a cast member - but I thought James Best had some real talent and I do not know if I\'m impressed or saddened by him putting so much of that kind of film on.'",0
"b'In my short list of unmissable titles for 2011, Jos\xc3\xa9 Padilha\'s ""Elite Squad: The Inner Enemy"" certainly was at the top of the list. The first time I heard about Padilha was with the documentary ""Bus 174"", 2002, an unforgettable and true story about a bus kidnapping that has spread publicly in the Brazilian media. It was a distressing image that had so much to say about contemporary journalism, rampant crime, local corruption, political maneuvering, and police status as the actual event it represented. I think it\'s fair to say that some of these same themes remained a constant in all future director / writer work. That said, I want to point out that `` Elite Troop: The Internal Enemy \'\' is actually a sequel to the 2007 project titled (you guessed it) `` Elite Troop. ""Although the two films are certainly better served as complementary pieces, this has a self-contained story that can be enjoyed on its own merits. If you choose to see this without seeing the first picture, you may lose some of the character\'s stories - but the script makes it faster and more efficient. The film revolves around the character of Captain Nascimento, effectively played by Wagner Moura. Moura is responsible for a special crime unit, and when a prison riot goes awry, squad tactics and decisions are questioned by human rights activists (led spectacularly by her ex-wife\'s new husband). Public opinion, however, side by side with fast and uncompromising performance Moura and pushes him into a position of even more power. Making it a mission to eliminate the rampant drug crisis in Rio, it targets the lower-class favelas where the problem has its strongest point. But by eliminating the obvious enemy, it can make way for a more unexpected enemy. While dirty cops and unscrupulous politicians jockey for new power, Moura begins to realize that he has cut off a monster\'s head to see another (more nefarious) one take its place. Unable to rely on power, he sees new allies in the media and activists who once criticized Moura\'s methods. The turnaround is compelling, believable and undeniably scary. The film is filmed in a gritty documentary style that makes the nasty even more tangible. Although perhaps the narrative depends a little too much on the voice analysis, it keeps Moura\'s point of view in perspective, since the great story leaves him on the fringes of large parts of the action. In essence, this is a morality game disguised as a relentless crime saga - but, in that sense, it is surprisingly underestimated. The character changes are subtle and the action is inexorably real. It\'s hard to imagine that the film can have a happy or satisfying conclusion, but what we have left is certainly appropriate, even if it does not involve everything in a small curve. In the end, the characters distinguish this piece (Moura is fantastic) that has universal relevance in its subjects of corruption and those that fight it. `` Elite Troop: The Internal Enemy \'\' is a rare image that will make you think while having fun. About 4 1/2 stars. KGHarris, 2/12.'",1
"b""THAT IS TERRIBLE ! I do not believe it's from the same person who wrote Phantom of the Opera, Les Mis, Cats, etc. The music is not memorable, the lyrics are sophomoric and the plot is complete crap. It changes the story as presented in Phantom, and the characters' personalities are completely altered to make it work. The Phantom runs to Coney Island to start a circus / show of horrors after the events in Paris. Madame Giry and her daughter Meg follow. Meg becomes a burlesque dancer obsessed with the Phantom. Madame Giry wants to turn them on. Christine, Raul and her son are drawn to Cony Island to open a new opera house, but the Phantom convinces Christine to sing at their show. Raul is now an evil drunk, and Christine is now in love with the Phantom, who has shifted from the pitiful, spoiled, and dangerous genius of the original musical to someone who obeys the rules and is gentle, selfless, and likes clowns and bad carnival music. Oh, and by the way, it's revealed that Christine slept with him the night before his wedding and Gustave is actually the son of the Ghosts! Everything about this musical is so bad. Spare the pain of watching it.""",0

"b""Black Sheep (no, not Chris Farley and David Spade starring in the mid-'90s movie) is a movie that has to be seen to be believed. Taking place in New Zealand as a phobic sheep man (Nathan Meister) returns to his old family farm to make amends with his brother (Peter Feeney) who happens to be genetically altering the sheep that populate the land. These sheep do away with a hunger for human flesh, and those they bite become monstrous sheep (yes, they were sheep), and before you know it, they are going crazy. Yes, Black Sheep sounds absolutely ridiculous, and by all means is, but the film is so entertaining that you can not help but admire it. Not to mention the brilliant effects of gore and creature, courtesy of Peter Jackson's WETA workshop staff, while rookie scriptwriter and director Jonathan King plays a visual gag directly at you after another on top of bunches of blood. It does not come close to the irreverent horror / fun of Shaun of the Dead itself, but for what it's worth, Black Sheep is so much fun that comic horror fans should definitely take a look.""",1
"b'The Bunny Works REALLY came a long way since the last animated film and a very medicore one, & quot; King and I & quot; . Now this stunning new movie finally features wonderful, well-developed characters, very professional animation, lots of quick action that no eye can follow, simply CUTE art graphics, and a very severe message about xenophobia and the need for respect. life . It happens in the late 1950s, when America was still terrified of a cold war, a boy stays home alone watching science fiction movies while his beautiful young mother worked late into the night at the local restaurant. Then he hears some funny noises, so he goes investigating and so runs to the most unlikely friend he ever would: an imposing robot that could swallow cars and flatten entire forest areas. However, this mechanical monster becomes a very kind creature, full of innocence and love. And along comes a pointy-nosed detective who is smelling suspiciously at any clue about the strange events in the small town of Maine. Poor Hogarth (what a name!) He has to fight feverishly to protect the great stranger who undoubtedly feels very ill received here on this planet. A great work of art that will win the respect of the collective public who, unfortunately, was conditioned to consider animation as a feature coated with sugar for small children. But - this medium can be a very powerful storyteller as a truly comprehensive proof as & quot; The Iron Giant & quot; will definitely prove it!'",1
"b""I was very excited to try Tracy Anderson's method, but when I received the Dance Cardio DVD, it was nothing like what he said it would be. Dance combinations are difficult, and you need to spend time learning all the combinations before you even start training.

They took more than a week to get back to me and then said they can not return or exchange opened DVD's. But how the hell would anyone know if they're happy about it before they even open the package? Hit me ! Full hit, if you ask me. I am very upset that the customer service is so horrible.

"b'`` Destination Moon \'\' and `` Rocketship XM \'\' both came out the same year - but that\'s where the similarity ends. I consider ""Destination Moon"" the father of the modern science fiction movie.

What helps this movie is the fact that there are no real stars in it - but very competent actors and very recognizable at the very least. `` Rocketship XM \'\', on the other hand, was a fast-paced movie made for `` ... Moon \'\' in theaters. The black and white print quality is stunning, having been restored to its original sharp quality. Lloyd Bridges stars. The special effects for `` XM \'\' were decent for their time, but the effects for `` ... Moon \'\' were ahead of their time. If I were rating these movies, I would give `` ..

"b'Here\'s a riddle for all of you. What do you call ten gallons of ice cream and one scoop of dung? Ten gallons of manure. I do not care how much they wear the DVD version of this movie, it does not change the fact that it\'s terrible. I\'m just giving this star, but keep five or six Advil at hand. That should be enough to cover you for it. A couple of tips on this disaster: It\'s made by Uwe Boll, director of two of the WORST films I\'ve seen in \'House of the Dead\' and \'Alone in the Dark\'. In what was for me an impressive moment of brutal honesty, Boll himself admitted that he did not release the film until TWO WEEKS before the start of filming. What he ended up was a bunch of ""names"" who happened to have a hole in the agenda and appeared for a quick payment and a free trip to Romania. It also shows that the whole movie looks like they just skipped the essay and no one seems at all interested in making an honest effort. Will Sanderson and Michael Madsen may have discovered the only way to survive a Boll movie. They were completely intoxicated throughout the production. Ben Kingsley, who previously had to deal with Madsen in the movie ""Species"" refused to even be in the same set with him. In the harem scene with Meatloaf, these are HONEST TO GOD, 100% ROMAN PROSTITUTES WITH FULL-BLOODED. I swear you can not do these things. Apparently Boll could not play real actresses (his union fees made them very expensive), so he decided he could cut costs just by ordering for the real thing. This is a disaster from front to back. I\'ll give it, it\'s better than his last two movies. ""Bloodrayne"", at least, is a bit unintentionally funny. Even though I said that, I could never recommend anyone to see this. It will only encourage the man to continue. Uwe Boll, no doubt in my mind, is the most untalented filmmaker I\'ve ever seen. I\'m absolutely surprised this guy keeps finding his way behind a camera ...'",0

I've danced most of my life, so most low-impact workout exercises I've ever been familiar with, but the repetition is wonderful, and I'm a little sore the next day every time I do the low-impact workout . High impact training is a different story. I've done this once since I had the DVD and could hardly walk the next day! ! This comes from a dancer who is in good shape. The high impact workout is mostly squatting. As soon as I recover from the last time I did this, I'll do it again because it's great and it's so good for you! There is an additional workout for both arms and abs. Each set has Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders demonstrating. Three of the cheerleaders have been selected to perform beginner, intermediate and advanced exercises, so you can choose which one to follow. The only thing I do not care about is that the coach who leads the practice talks a lot. . He is very motivating, however, and especially people who are not very familiar or motivated for the workout, I think they would really benefit from it. I was hesitant to buy a training DVD because of previous disappointment with them and lack of motivation to make them a few more times, but this DVD is an exception.

The viewer leaves where he came from. It is relatively frustrating that the movie insults the viewer's intelligence with lazy plot devices. For example, there are scenes involving the movement of huge and noisy machines, but the characters are not aware of the machines until the machines are on top of them. Or consider that barrels of oil or gasoline or tubes of molten metal or liquid nitrogen are conveniently ubiquitous so that the characters can shoot when needed to make an explosion or melt some machine. The movie is full of such devices. They play out, one after another, for about two hours. Nothing else happens. We have learned nothing new.

Kristanna Loken, best known for being sexy and playing TX in Terminator 3, stars as the vampire heroine in this incoherent mess, which for some strange reason also features Oscar winner Ben Kingsley as the evil Kagan. The plot is the typical agreement between humans and vampires, but the most intriguing aspect of Bloodrayne is how Boll managed to put these actors in this movie? It's incomprehensible how Kinglsey, Michael Madsen, Michelle Rodriguez and Billy Zane ended up in this, all spitting out some of the most terrible dialogues you've ever heard.

"b'+++++ This film is based on the musical piece ""Cabaret"" (also called ""Goodbye Berlin""). The music and lyrics are from the great John Kander and Fred Ebb, respectively. It was directed by, and the numbers of dance and music were staged by the late Bob Fosse. Personally, I\'m not much into musicals, but this movie is so much more than a great musical. Do not understand that there is just singing and dancing. There is also a good story that plunges into the corruption, decay and false dreams of Berlin in the early 1930s, when Hitler was coming to power. The story follows the life of Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) during this turbulent period. She is the so-called star of Kit Kat nightclub who has a master of ceremonies (Joel Gray). Writer Brian Roberts (Michael York) intrudes into Sally\'s world, hoping to take the vacant room opposite her. He soon discovers that she is a ball of fire and energy. It tells us of his dream: \'\' I\'m going to be a big movie star. That is, if drink and sex do not catch me first. `` The movie alternates between real and hard life outside the Kit Kat nightclub and the carefree life inside it, where those who take part can forget their troubles and troubled times. The music and dance routines within Kit Kat Klub provide an acute counterpoint to the real-life drama outside. Five songs from the original Broadway production did not enter the film as ""performed,"" but appear as background music. The music, the costumes, the choreography and the performance are all excellent. Especially impressive is Minnelli\'s performance, impressive on stage and equally compelling. Combining with her is Gray\'s fascinating acting as the Master of Ceremonies that injects humor and excitement as well as effervescence and soundness in procedures. The last scene of music and dance performed by Minnelli is historical and unforgettable! This film won eight Oscars, including Best Actress (Minnelli), Best Supporting Actor (Gray) and Best Director (Fosse). Finally, the DVD itself (released in 2003) is perfect in picture and sound quality. It has a long list of interesting extras. In conclusion, I recommend you to go to this cabaret (old friend). You will never want to leave! ! (1972, 2 hours, wide screen, 32 scenes) +++++'",1

Personal note: In the 1970s I met the late Budd Boetticher as a friend. We would stay at Griffith Park with its Andalusians and make several trips to Mexico, where he still practiced his dangerous and beloved art of fighting with bulls on horseback. In life and in movies, he seemed obsessed with playing the role of male antagonist in constant battle with the environment.

"b""Stereotyped characters, complicated logic and an abundant absence of intelligence remain in & quot; Domestic Disorder, & quot; a thriller that wants to be disobedient, but ends up playing well. What begins as a somewhat interesting film turns into an endless chasm of unbelievable twists and aggravating characters that make all the wrong choices. Here is a movie that covers familiar terrain, but does not arouse much interest when things go wrong. John Travolta plays Frank Morrison, a boat builder whose ex-wife Susan (Teri Polo) is about to remarry. This, of course, is unacceptable to his 12-year-old son, Danny (Matthew O'Leary), whose explosions against his parents' divorce have led to police seizure on several occasions. Like any good father, Frank advises Danny to accept what he can not change, and give his new stepfather, the rich and popular Rick Barnes (Vince Vaughn), a warm welcome. Now anyone who knows their thrillers can guess that if money is involved then there is usually a tainted past here and there; this movie is no exception. The marriage continues smoothly, despite the presence of Ray Coleman (Steve Buscemi), a former acquaintance of Rick, who is engaged in collecting a large sum of money from his old friend. One thing leads to another, inventions appear, and Rick has a murder in his hands, unaware that Danny witnessed the action of the back seat of the car in which it occurred. This is the first in a series of several scenes that look promising but have little intensity or surprise. Judging from Danny's & quot; Boy who screamed wolf & quot; It is easy to predict that no one will believe him when he reveals what he has seen, except Frank, who must hold a grudge against his son's aggressor if there is any action or energy in the story. There's a bit of cat and mouse going on while Frank searches for Ray's disappearance and possible leads to take to the police, but that's nowhere to be seen. The film seems more interested in showing us how stupid people can be in such situations, however unbelievable. From the beginning, Susan stands by her man, defending him against Danny's accusations. Does it ever occur to you that when a strange event happens, Rick was away from home at the same time? Has she ever stopped to think about how her disbelief in her son's statements is affecting him, rather than the old song and dance about her marriage to Rick? Even the police are completely ignorant, ignoring everything until the end, when that matters little. My big complaint with & quot; Domestic Disruption & quot; is his editor, who reduced the film to just 88 minutes, too short for a thriller and too long for a documentary about vengeful stepfathers. Paramount's ad campaign for the movie hit us with a number of pre-release television commercials as well as a long and revealing theatrical trailer. There are scenes in both, one involving a car chase, the other involving an argument between Rick and Frank in which Rick tries to buy it. These and other glimpses are not even included in the final cut, and may have been more interesting than what we see here. The climax is the standard fodder, but it has the ability to generate more intensity than the rest of the film. Travolta performs well, convincing us of his loving father status; Vaughn can not generate a sense of threat, while Polo does little more than look totally ignorant. For all your attributes (which are few), & quot; Domestic Disruption & quot; adds nothing new to a worn-out genre; his lack of lucid plot could be neglected were it not for his failure to generate any level of suspense. Note: The movie was filmed on the east coast of North Carolina in Southport, but in one scene, Ray mentions that Rick was in a childhood memory of Rick on a family vacation in Maryland.

"b'I love a good vampire movie, whether scary like ""Nosferatu"" or exaggerated as ""The Lost Boys"". Unfortunately I can not say the same for ""Bloodrayne"", which is neither scary nor exaggerated. What I did not like about this turkey from a movie was the way it was edited. There was no real beginning. All that the viewer learns about Rayne (Kristanna Loken) is through a series of annoying flashbacks. I can not believe that Oscar winner Ben Kingsley was tied to this horrible movie, at least `` Species \'\' was really scary, disgusting, still fun. ""Bloodrayne"" is neither. So far I never thought a love scene could be so hilarious (unintentional) until I saw Rayne and Sebastian come in. It was so bad it was funny. Although the two Underworld films did not really offer anything substantial, at least those movies were fun, ""Bloodrayne"" was not. Bad acting, bad writing, all bad. Apparently, Hollywood has not learned from the disasters of the past that video games do not produce good movies (like ""Super Mario Bros."" and ""Mortal Kombat"").'",0

I recently bought the film, not realizing it had been cut to a 1.33: 1 from a 1.85: 1, and I finally feel that if I'm paying for a movie, I should own the whole thing. not having reviewed the ratio before the purchase, but in addition, it's a great film without the Coppola dribble in the middle.""",0
"b""He is a clear teacher and the exercises are presented at the right pace. It takes time to explain the logic behind the practice, which seems a good idea to say to those who are learning exclusively through DVDs. The two songs you learn here, a classic, a bossa nova, are nice pieces, and your The pace of teaching here is a little faster. In short, it gives you so much information beyond what you could imagine it would be here. My problems with the DVD are two. On the one hand, as with other DVDs of this publisher, you're paying almost thirty dollars for sixty minutes of DVD. Traum is also a good teacher, but this seems very expensive to me. There are other offers out there, better and similar information is free on the web, so I'm not totally happy about it. The second problem is that the fingerstyle exercises are pretty basic. I use patterns in the daily game that are more intricate than the ones it gives, and so to me this seemed simple (I would certainly do them, though) and I had worked out a lot myself. The only exercise that seemed intermediate to me were the arpeggios, in the third and second positions, which are more about the left hand than with the right hand technique. The two songs, however, are beyond the beginner, more intermediary. It seems to me that most buyers will be disappointed with one or another half of this 60-minute DVD - or bored as I was at the basic level of exercise or bullied by the complexity of the songs. What I would have preferred are 60 minutes of exercises, increasingly complex. I suppose the average buyer would find this very boring (teach me songs! They might say) but I'm very interested in getting better and knowing how to learn other instruments than repetitive exercises are the way to do it. I wanted a DVD guide for them, rather than a fat, printed book of them, and that's not exactly what I expected.

"b""Armand Assante is one of my favorites. I loved all your movies. I was so surprised to see him in a doo-wap role, but he was fantastic as always. His emotional performance of a man who lost his wife to cancer and is now dealing with the potential loss of his daughter's same disease is heart-breaking. His relationship with his two children also brings a reality to his parents' love for their children and to the torment of his singing career in the past. He and his group of 50s singers made a big hit, but were soon out of the limelight. Over the next 30 years, he works as a bartender and his group plays in weddings. If you love doo-wap and Assante, you'll love this movie. Nostalgia at its best. I recommend picking up the audio CD and playing it before watching the movie, so you'll really like it.""",1
"b'For the big fans of Manhunter, I advise you to avoid this DVD if you plan to own ... What was advertised as & quot; Theatrical & quot; version is actually a poorly mended version that awkwardly edits two scenes that had been in the theatrical version, including one of the most crucial scenes, and still has in it some of the most banal scenes restored from the cutting room floor. These cuts are poorly made and do not make sense to them, since they do not represent the theatrical release and destroy what was a finely edited film. I do not know if it was ignorance or arrogance, but this is the worst hacker job I\'ve ever seen trying to get by product. Whoever was in charge at Anchor Bay was an idiot, and if I were Michael Mann, I would call my lawyers. & Quot; Director\'s Cut & quot; is even worse in that it includes & quot; Non-Theatrical & quot; launch and so-called & quot; Director\'s Cut & quot; - a compilation of some interesting and not so interesting takes. As a companion to a true theatrical release, this would have been a fascinating addition; But here again, Anchor Bay finds a way to ruin what should be a good product. The entire film that has not gone through video post-production is stained and foggy, as if it had been transferred from a VHS tape - and a worn tape. ""It\'s simply amazing that someone might have the audacity to offer this kind of price for the hard earned money. I saw this movie when it first came out in the movies and considered it one of the best of that year; and I ran to buy the LaserDisc version when it came out. When DVD Director\'s Cut was released by Anchor Bay this year, I was on the waiting list - ready to receive the enhanced THX widescreen version. Being intimately aware of the film, imagine my disappointment. Do not waste your time. Wait for a better version to leave. As for those people who want to compare the Silence of the Lambs to Manhunter, they usually favor one over the other and their minds are very well made right now. I\'m good at the Hunters\' Camp. For me, I liked Silence, but I could never take it seriously since I found Reader\'s portayal both caricaturedly superhuman and therefore unreal and unsuspended. However, Manhunter\'s Reader is a creepy but more realistic portrait that surprises me every time I see this in how an evil genius manages to manipulate events out of his cell through the simple apparatus of a telephone. This Reader is surely behind steralized bars - and yet it manages to be a strong presence for TBE told with.I hope every fan and future fan of Manhunter gets to see it the way it first appeared, a beautiful piece of handicraft which was slim and elegant, and yet it flowed elegantly.

"b""One of the nicest movies of the '80s is Big, in which Tom Hanks ... well, you know. I liked almost everything about this two-disc set. A great success, however.

If you play the theatrical version with Comment set to On, you receive essentially nothing, BUT comment. No movie dialogue can be heard as far as I could tell. Playing theatrical or extended versions with Comment set to Off is fine. The Extras disk is cool, but the flaws mentioned should really be addressed.""",1
"b'It\'s my fault that I have higher expectations for this movie, but I\'m guessing this movie was not made exactly for guys like me anyway. The acting is good, the character of Matthew McConaughey, Ben and Kate Hudson, Andie really have to act and react. The dialogue does not matter. The character of Kate Hudson always has the right side, which is good for a while, but after an hour gets tiring. It completely invades every aspect of Ben\'s life; we never see Andie\'s world apart from her two friends and workplace. So while both characters have a similar agenda, there\'s a complete imbalance of weariness, and that to me is the biggest gap in the movie. He fights all her attempts at ""losing"" him, but all this only produces frustration in Andie - and feeds her to do crazier things. As a spectator, you\'re dying to see her fall on your face just once. But this is an illusion. Ben\'s resistance to Andie\'s antics hardly amuses me, and Andie\'s total disgrace does not please me. Of course both are great, and Hudson smiles positively when she smiles, but man, 112 minutes is a long time to support this game. I can imagine some people thinking that this movie is great. Girl Power and everything. I do not know . But I think we can agree that the film was conceived as a vehicle for Kate Hudson\'s rise to stardom. This film reminds me a little of WHAT WOMEN WANT (with Mel Gibson) for a variety of reasons, but notably because it was written and produced by women - which in the world of male-dominated filmmaking is a much-needed perspective - but Nancy Myers (a producer / director of What Women Want) is definitely much smarter than the ""brains"" behind How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days. You just have to watch the extras on the DVD to see proof of this. We met two of the producers, who obviously had facelifts. I\'m serious . It is scary . They talk about the material as if it were Shakespeare. Then there\'s director Donald Petrie, who is totally lacking in charisma. MAKING OF with it is so cheap that it\'s probably funnier to watch than most of the movie. While he is there talking, a TV monitor behind him shoots pictures of the movie, and an office worker (with his back to the camera) stares at a static PC screen while biting his nails and shakes his head a lot. She does this throughout the duration of the interviews with Petrie. Oh, and did I mention the background music that accompanies the extras? It\'s department store. Or elevator music. That you always hate more. I did not bother with the comment. Donald is a pain in the ass. There are no outtakes, which is now unusual for a comedy. The deleted scenes are really good, some honest emotions are shown by Andie and we have some quieter moments between the two tracks. Look, it started well. It looked like it would be harmless cute romantic comedy, but the romance lasted about 10 minutes. I can summarize my criticism with this remark from director Petrie because he was interested in directing the film. He says it was because he discovered Kate Hudson was attached to him. Aha So basically, if the film does well at the box office, then it will launch Hudson\'s career and career. Sorry Petrie, but that\'s not good enough for me.'",0

"b""This is the romantic comedy by which all other romantic comedies are now judged. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan have undeniable chemistry and first-timing timing. And surprisingly also Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher, who really have great moments that add fun to the film. This film knows that no one knows how to present Manhattan better than Woody Allen and takes much of its traditions. Including the choice of romantic pop patterns. As in Annie Hall, & quot; It had to be you & quot; is the musical centerpiece for an inevitable coupling. The dialogue is fast and rhythmic, with an ear for the sensibility of New York. And you also know how to display New York's favorite hangouts at their best. Even Billy Crystal is a bit foggy. Yet this film is an original and its style has been imitated numerous times by other films hoping to capture some of its magic. Still, none surpasses that. The icing on the cake was the wonderful choice to interrupt the past seasons of Harry and Sally's relationship with the old couple telling stories of their first date. The way they speak and take on each other's stories is charming and authentic and forces smiles of recognition. When Harry Met Sally is a fun and funny movie that never tires, no matter how many times it's seen. It's a classic. The DVD contains about 7 minutes of additional deleted images. In this case, it is quite apparent because it was deleted. Watch at your own risk. Rob Reiner's audio commentary seems to have been delivered under the gun's sights. Do not look for many joyful anecdotes or insights about where it came from with all these great ideas. The comment track is very slow and dry. & Quot; Making of & quot; the documentary is a little more fun and insightful, so the extras are not a total wash. The sound and image quality is bright and lush, so the most important part of the disc, the movie, is as enjoyable as possible.

"b'MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR has to be one of the most intense action movies ever produced. There is very little that I can add to this already popular film. Both fans and critics are unanimous in praising the best chapter in the MAD MAX trilogy. Having said that, it is also EXTREMELY sad to see the kind of DVD treatment that this highly innovative film received. Unlike the special edition of MAD MAX DVD, this is austere at best: a mixture of subtitles and ""passable"" subtitles. That\'s it . Image quality is only slightly ""acceptable"" (dark scenes are highly pixelated and difficult to understand!). No comment from the director, not backstage, nothing. For a movie being praised as a LANDMARK in science fiction and considered as influential as the STAR WARS, the DVD that is available is a shame. Why no one ever bothered to release a special edition is beyond my account. We see a lot of `` rubbish \'\' being released as a `` special edition \'\' and we still have to wait for a defamatory DVD of MAD MAX 2. My opinion, as you may have guessed, is about this more criminal offense. I have a MAD MAX 2 rate with an 11 (yes, it\'s a very fun movie), but the DVD really stinks.

"b'I do not understand what constitutes a comedy these days. Here is another ""comedy"" that is bland and focuses heavily on the same tired jokes, mostly sexually related, without trying to develop any kind of plot. The acting is not worthy of note, the script is below standard and the direction seems uninspired. What a winner! Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy play newlyweds who at the beginning of the movie are returning from what was clearly not a great honeymoon. They act like children, running against each other on walls and throwing gum in the other\'s hair. We came back to meet them (Kutcher beating her in the face with a soccer ball) and subsequent romance. He is a transit reporter from the cemetery of a radio station while she has had all the education possible and is an avid art lover. The honeymoon is in Europe. Soon you must realize what some of the jokes will be. How about trying to connect something of America to the wall when the outlets do not fit and the energy is twice as strong? Ha Ha. Then there are the jokes about European hygiene, with huge bugs crawling on our heroes when they are at the next hotel. Driving in Europe? So you have to get one of those European cars the size of a suitcase that can not be a worse yellow tone. Oh, and there are no extra points to guess that an old Murphy flame will come and try to steal it. In short, this movie is bad.

Instead, all 8 routines are presented first - each a front view, the back - slowly, quickly - and without music.

"b'This is not a review of the quality of DVD, cinematography, acting, etc., but rather the essential element of what I consider to be the most intelligent film of the year, although it is not illegible. * Spoiler alert * From what I read, it seems that most of these reviewers did not understand the final ambiguity or, if they did, found this very implausible. The first group (most viewers), not realizing the ambiguity of whether they actually did or did not, seemed to miss the last line that goes back to the conversation with the director, the philosophical core of the film, in which case Leo is resisting accepting which is the nature of man to be violent. If nothing else, the last line suggests that if he really did what they say, he at least has a certain level of self-knowledge about it, is looking for his insanity and refusing to live with it. Or it could be the case that he was always sane, that he really was right about what was happening and refused to accept his suggested memories and vision of the director but realizing that he could never escape and so decide \'die a hero . From what some have said, that this last premise is too incredible, I disagree. Why is it so hard to believe that a country would be incapable of something like that? During the time frame of this film, most US states were still sterilizing the mentally and physically disabled. Would it be such a moral step to go from there to experiment with psychotic criminals, people with no future, for the sake of our national security, our way of life, our dominion in world affairs? Of course, there are problems interpreting the end of the film. It would be a great coincidence if the four names were really anagrams of themselves. He has dreams throughout the film that allude to the end, even before the explanation is suggested by the doctor (although I\'ve only seen it once and may be missing something). On the other hand, if Leo really hallucinated the scene in the cave with Rachel , so why was there a total lack of surrealism, unlike all other sequences? The practical answer, to convince the public to the end, is not credible. The contradictions here seem to derive from the fact that Scorsese is revisiting the same theme he explored at the end of ""Comedy King,"" and in the same style: we\'re guessing if it really happened or if it\'s all in the character\'s mind. I did not read the book, but from what I understood, Scorsese added a layer that was not present in Lehane\'s work, where it\'s definitely only in the character\'s mind, similar to the Machinist (not to beat Lehane). : with his psychological depth and misanthropic vision about human nature, he is the heir of the great Clouzot - though probably more successful in ""Mystic River."" Adding the ambiguity at the end without changing some plot points to initialize, gaps arise in logic. If that had been cleaned up a bit, I would not hesitate to classify \'SI\' with \'Raging Bull\' and \'Taxi Driver\'. Even so, this is still one of the good ones.'",1

X-2 does not need to bombard viewers with so much information (as this was mostly solved in the first movie), and it may well happen. We took exactly where the first movie stopped: Magneto is in jail, Wolverine is looking for clues about his past, and anti-mutant hysteria is rampant. Enter William Stryker, a government employee fanatic mutant hater, excellently played by Brian Cox. He sends mutant blue-skinned Nightcrawler to tear the White House and overflow the president in the impressive opening sequence, ensuring presidential cooperation with the anti-mutant agenda . Stryker wastes no time in setting up a secret force attack team, and his first target is ... ..to Professor Xavier\'s school. It seems they chose the wrong time to visit, however; The children are alone at home with their ""nanny"" ... ... Wolverine! Let\'s get ready for RUMMMMBBBLLEEEE! ! ! Before you know it, it\'s a total war between Stryker and the mutant faction assembled; Magneto is released from prison, Xavier and Cyclops are captured and used by Stryker, and the stage is set for a fight between the winner and Alkali Lake, where Wolvie can discover some interesting details about his skeleton and Adamantium claws. The fans disappointed with the lack of action in the first film will be in their glory here, as the number of fights was increased quickly, including an excellent dispute between Wolverine and Deathstrike, interpreted by the adorable Kelly Hu, and the barbaric anger of Wolverine in the mansion . I love the way he dispatches Stryker\'s henchmen ...! Director Bryan Singer has put together an excellent cast and each character takes their moment to shine. The new additions, Cox and Hu, do a great job with their respective roles, and the end sets the stage for X-3. Long-time fans will appreciate the appearances of X-Men artists such as The Beast, Colossus, Siryn, Artie and Kitty Pryde, and will heed the mentions of Gambit and Franklin Richards, among others. Bad news ... ? The film starts strong but gets half dragged at the end; Maybe some tighter edition was needed. In addition, considering how heavily the film draws on characters and situations developed by X-Men comic writer Chris Claremont, including the plot stripped out of his legendary graphic novel ""God Loves, Man Kills,"" I was more than a little appalled to see him not recognized in the credits. The X-2 is not a perfect movie, but it\'s a big step up from the previous X-Men movie, and a great way to start the summer movie season.'",1

"b""This is not a review of the film, but of Bluray himself. If you're into this new wave of Japanese splatter movies, then you know what to expect, and Tokyo Gore Police is among the best of its kind. However, Media Blasters dropped the ball with this release. Or rather, someone in your art department is simply incredibly lazy. The back cover was copied and pasted from its 2-disc DVD edition. This version of Bluray is a disk, not two. In addition, the bonus material listed (behind-the-scenes TGP short films) is not on the disc. What you get is a trailer for the movie and for other Tokyo Shock releases. The download is hopefully average (these cheap, fast-made capture features will never ever shine), and there are DTS-HD 5.1 audio tracks in Japanese and Japanese. This only confounds the idea that these kinds of misconceptions happen nowadays. To shame, Media Blasters.""",0

"b'I agree with the first guy. This movie pack was not so good. I bought it in hopes of seeing some actual combat scenes (or any other footage) taken from the Vietnam War. instead, each VHS that supposedly specifically targets a US fighting aspect in Vietnam (ie the Marines, Bombers, Navy, Helicopters, etc.) shows the same footage over and over again. For example, every video shows a dive helicopter firing rockets and B-52s throwing bombs, which is cool the first time you see it, but after 10,000 times it gets old and you realize you lost your money.'",0

"b'So, \'Ally McBeal\' definitely ended now, although this episode compilation reminds us of what was great about it. Focusing around Ally\'s perpetually single, slender and eccentric (Flockhart), the audience is drawn to her hallucinations (brilliantly perceived through a stunning computer animation), her loves, her losses and her work in a law firm that seems to embrace the stranger. What made this show great was that it was so different with David E. Kelley\'s sharp writing bringing a mixture of well-placed observations about modern relationships and absolutely hilarious characters. Who could forget John Cage (McNicol), the diminutive lawyer with a pet frog and a passion for Barry White? Add to that Richard Fish, who seems to wallow in his own male chauvinism, ""Subzero"" Nelle (diRossi) and the deliciously nasty Ling (Liu) and you have a nice cast that is quite nice, whatever they are doing. Recent episodes have been criticized for not being funny enough, this may seem unfair, although there is always a tendency to be nostalgic about the older episodes that are offered here. It balances very funny, romantic and sad and these previous episodes were genuinely revolutionary, paving the way for more experimental shows. Still, it would be nice to see the stations in their entirety, as they are available in the UK.'",1
"b""Down Argentine Way is a delightful kind of light music from the early 1940s that should delight anyone who loves this kind of movie. We have great performances from great stars like Betty Grable, Don Ameche, Carmen Miranda and the amazing Nicholas Brothers dance! The plot follows a good rhythm and the performance was quite convincing. The action begins when horse-lover Glenda Crawford (Betty Grable) and her mother Binnie Crawford (Charlotte Greenwood) are on track - yet again. It seems the Crawford family has always loved horses and they love them, too. Glenda sees a beautiful racehorse and she wants to buy the horse - the problem is that the horse belongs to Don Diego Quintana (Henry Stephenson), who feeds a long and silly personal grudge against Willis Crawford, the horse's patriarch. the Crawford family. Anyway, Glenda and Binnie go to Argentina after their first attempt to buy horses from Quintana does not go very well. It is not long before Glenda falls in love with Quintana's son, Ricardo Quintana (Don Ameche), who is equally enchanted by Glenda. The young couple tries to pass Glenda Crawford to Don Quintana as Glenda Cunningham in the hope that he will enjoy her and then do not care if she is a Crawford; but this also has its complications. Meanwhile, there's a horse built to compete - will Don Quintana leave the horse race? It's a fragile subframe, but the few horse races we see in this movie increase the action; It's okay with me! Look for excellent numbers of music and dance - remember, these plots were pretty much just excuses for the studio to shoot fabulous numbers of music and dance. It is rumored that after the audience first saw The Nicholas Brothers dance, they celebrated so much that the projectionist had to rewind the movie to show their scene again! Charlotte Greenwood also scored big with her almost unbelievable ability to kick loudly with her legs while she danced cheerfully in another number. Betty Grable also dances very well. In addition, this film marks the cinematographic debut of Carmen Miranda; She sings some songs during the film as well as a brief song at the beginning of the film. Carmen shines even when they were not playing her as much as in later movies! The DVD comes with a superlative extra on the life and times of Betty Grable. She really looked like an especially sweet girl who actually did not want much of life and liked the life of her private family as best she could. The quality of the photos on the extra at Betty Grable is excellent. There is also a running commentary, but optional, for people who want to know what happened behind the scenes while the movie was being filmed. Great ! Overall, Down Argentine Way is a musical that deserves to be seen. I usually book five stars for an MGM musical; but this time Fox really did it right! Fans of classic movie musicals can not miss this!""",1

"b""The review you see above, the Amazon review, I must say is a lot of crap. I just watched the movie today, and I went to watch this movie with very low expectations, hoping that a cheap thrill would end the main weapons fights and a story that a six-year-old could have written in five minutes. However, I was pleasantly surprised after the first fight scene to see that there was indeed a story, and contrary to what I thought, it was surprisingly deep and very well made. The review above, the Amazon review caught my attention, stating that the fight scene was stupid for the fight was stimulated by a puppy. And if I had not seen the movie, I would probably have agreed that fighting over a puppy is pretty stupid, however, if you watch the scene, it's pretty exciting to hear the dogs being killed and to have a vision of an innocent puppy going even a cold-blooded killer and fiddling with something inside the clergy. I could continue for longer, however, I will not, I will close this review saying that this is a high quality movie magic. Action scenes, a story that will make you think of being grateful for emotions, and an ending that will make you smile from ear to ear. If you want to spend your money well, it will be wise to spend it on a movie of that high caliber.""",1
"b""I was disappointed with this DVD. I have a past of dance and I was able to quickly pick up all the routines. Those who have no experience in dance are ready for a great challenge (but it is doable if you are diligent and patient with yourself). Make sure you have a large space to do this - you will not work to live in condo if you have neighbors below you and you are jumping up and down. My other criticism is that during cardiovascular warm-up, Tracy changes what she's doing and does not verbalize what she's doing. For example, you're stretching your tendons with your head down (so you can not look at the tv), you've been in that position for some time, so you look up and Tracy is doing something else ... a? ? ? She did not even say she was moving on. I just feel like she's not very good with details. I noticed this on your Mat DVD, too (very frustrating on this DVD). Besides, I do not think she's very motivating or enthusiastic. She's quite introverted to be making these DVDs. I was thinking she might be like Jillian from The Biggest Loser ... Maybe I'll check out Jillian's Shred DVD next. I sold my Tracy Anderson DVDs on eBay last and got my total price back.""",0

"b'It seems that no other Broadway musical has ever been transferred so intact to the screen, with every facet of its production shining and gloriously theatrical in its staging. River City, Iowa, of course, does not look more realistic than the Land of Oz, but that\'s the way it should be. It\'s satire, and fortunately the director Morton DaCosta keeps everything in great shape, preserved to play exactly like on stage, even in relation to the opening number aboard a train where all the vendors are singing about a certain rascal posing as a music teacher . Will Smith\'s song has never sounded so good and has received specialist singing and dance from ROBERT PRESTON, SHIRLEY JONES, PAUL FORD and HERMIONE GINGOLD in the lead roles, all helped and encouraged by some of the best musicians. singing and dancing you could ask for in a musical of this type. Gingold is outrageously funny and Paul Ford as her husband, the mayor of River City, is equally violent in a comic role. But it\'s Preston\'s show from start to finish with co-star Shirley Jones, in excellent vocal form, as the skeptical librarian. One of the most cleverly staged numbers is the number ""Marian, The Librarian,"" which takes place in the city library, where sticks and sliding balconies become part of the intricately staged dance routine. All musical numbers are performed with professional charm by a talented group of actors / singers / dancers who are part of the citizenship of River City. Little Ron Howard, the boy with the lisp, who later passed the fame in the direction, is a highlight like Jones\' little brother. In short: Excellent old musical with the heart in the right place - American in the best tradition of the word. In short: It has more charm than the law allows.'",1

"b'Frankly, I watched the movie because of the talent behind it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with pretty much every aspect of this movie. There are times when the action oscillates between two sets of characters and situations (la Fifth Element), but there is little or no connection between the two situations, which makes me dizzy and confused rather than entertained or stimulated. There is an extreme development of the character, such as the countless times when we see Peggy (Laura Dern) going out to take a sip from her bottle or pouring herself a drink. The idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bher alcoholism hit my conscience to the point of annoying me, and then I discovered that the fact that she has a substance abuse problem has nothing to do with plot, character interaction or anything else. Why was Robert Altman so successful? Filler? The obsession with the Kennedy family by Connie (character of Tara Reid) is another case where a good amount of time is spent trying to show us this side of the character and is never followed by any tangible goal in the film. . Strangely, she is probably one of the most ""normal"" women in the picture. All of this would have led to a mediocre movie, but the ending really killed me. I have no idea what the ending should mean. In fact, this reinforces the idea that the whole plot was derived by the writers who completed several pages of Mad Libs and then edited them in a script. There is really no other explanation as to why so many aspects of the film seem to be so random (or random at best).'",0

"b""I am a sucker for any movie or piece that is historical, and this definitely fits in the era when women had few rights. Sometimes we need to look back at the story to see how we have progressed from those times. Women have come a long way in their independence and the right to live their lives in their own way. I would suggest to parents to let their children know how lucky they are to be able to choose the man you would like to marry, not what was good for the family. Weddings were organized and most marriages were considered only Bible roommates. Men have always had their lover to turn to when their wife is unavailable (pregnant) and if they were expelled from their wives' bed and considered to be in the doghouse. The film really portrayed the little control women had about their future. Now, about the movie ... is the true story about this duchess and her life.

The movie shows the way the classes interacted, and for an American like me, that's fascinating ... and so foreign. This DVD has some cool extras, especially deleted scenes.

"b'I really like Lost Highway and have waited years for this DVD release of 2008. I avoided buying the previous version of ""import"" due to explicit consumer complaints regarding the quality of the transfer. My potential concerns about sound and image quality were dissipated as I visualized this new US release. It looks and sounds great, keeping in mind the source material. The visual style of the film is sparse, simple and high contrast - represented by the aesthetic ""American wave"" of Lynch. The image maintains its integrity and the deep black employees do not suffer from the noise often seen in older or bad transfers; the colors are also solid for a DVD. The sound design is appropriately moody, moody, dark, evocative, provocative and interweaves a rather eclectic mix of songs with the invaluable contributions of composer Angelo Badalamenti. There may be a slightly irritating difference in volume between the almost whispers of Patricia Arquette and, say, Rammstein - but that\'s not an uncommon problem on DVDs. Otherwise, it sounds pretty cool. I\'m not going to review the film, but I will say that the complete lack of special features is more forgivable for such an unusual, ambiguous and artistic film as Lost Highway than any other film I can imagine now. I often see this film the way I see abstract art: the explanation is not only unjustified, but also largely undesirable. In other words, special features can be intriguing, but I almost do not miss them for a movie like Lost Highway.'",1

"b'The Golden Army - an army made to keep humanity under control because humanity has a problem in consuming everything around them. Elf-thinking and pixie-drawing, it has the power to do things that only the desperate - or crazy - would want. The Elvish type calculates this, divides his toy and lets the army rust. Unfortunately for humanity, rust is an arbitrary word and the Golden Army is something that has never ceased to be a threat. And when powerplay begins to emerge, the BPRD is the only one that has the skills to stop it. When I knew the original footage of the movie, I knew the director / Migola knew what I was doing, but it scared me. a little . I say this because Hellboy II was creatively based on a novelization between Christopher Golden and Mike Mignola and is not truly reflective of Hellboy. It had a good idea and some good creature characteristics, but in the end, the book was a slight disappointment. Fast forward to the book and you saw what a good director could do with something that needed a touch of gold (pardon the pun). The toothfairies, Wink, the elemental, the goblin, the angel (if you want to understand that pet and what it says more, check out the background story of Anung Un Rama and the way the beast was created. story space and highlights some lovely things that a person should see for himself to really understand everything) and all the characters in between. Fortunately, the cast has always been good, the direction is fabulous, and Hellboy is portrayed as Hellboy should be portrayed. That means he thinks with his fist, has a gun the size of a small man and is not really full of a little thing called respect. As far as what the movie offered, let me tell you that it had a little bit of everything. The action was very good, the human elements (and I use humans loosely) from the tale were fantastic, and the film explored a bit more than it is the BRPD. They allowed viewers to appear in every person, in their tastes and desires, and added a new character that translates strangely from book to film, but still translates well as a character. Ron is a perfect Hellboy too, and he lets it shine in this new part. In the part with the elemental you can see how much it is impacted, and in the struggles with specific beings you can say that it does not want to hurt them. He wants to be appreciated by all and understands the suffering of things that ""threaten"" humanity. Del Toro adding that in done in incredible because that is one of the things Hellboy in the books - enough for the BPRD and he really has some big problems. If you like Hellboy and you want a movie about it, this is good work. I know there have been many complaints here and there about certain aspects of the film, but Hellboy is a solid follow up and fans of the novels / the first movie will have fun. If you pay extra attention to the details involved, you will find all sorts of good things hidden in the background, allowing a look at what Anung Un Rama is fighting like a demon made human by his own choices. You can also see potential elements that could have ramifications for the world and for everyone who inhabits it - I really enjoyed that too. Combine this with a lot of extra (we even have a comic book that moves to keep ADD viewers in satisfied nodes), and you have a second help that explores what the first movie could only build. Highly loved.'",1
"b""I thought I had found a jewel ... A DVD that covered the performances of one of the pioneers of the metal ... the early years of one of the greatest bands of all time. Hum no. Someone is launching a deliberate fraud on the Deep Purple DVDs that seem to suggest you have live performances, but all you really get is a bunch of strangers reminding you about the band. The very few performances you get in any of these dogs have a terrible A / V quality. My expectations were never high in relation to the A / V based on when they were recorded. But the big problem is THERE'S MUCH PERFORMANCE. These Critical Review series are DVDs of interviews with a bunch of people who might know the band. And with the performances (mostly out-takes) you get, you start yelling at the TV to show the performers; the clips show things like the public, the moon or the sky as the band plays. The price of this release is a joke to the junk content you receive. This piece of shit is not worth even a dollar in my opinion for the relatively uninteresting Deep Purple items you get throughout the purple set.Deep fans do not be fooled.

"b""First I have to say that. Whether you're expecting a story or a hero like Spider-Man, you're in for a shock. The cut of Daredevil directors is one of the best director cuts I've ever seen. Not only does the plot have more substance with the addition of deleted scenes, but it also ties the plot holes as well. There was also a subplot about blind attorney Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) and Foggy Nelson (Jon Faverou) defending what appears to be a guilty client, played by rapper Coolio of the 1990s. In this cut, you see Matt Murdock more, and you can really see why Mark Steven Johnson chose Affleck to make the blind watcher. When I first saw the original version, I thought Affleck was fine. But after that, I can say that Affleck was the perfect choice for Daredevil / Matt Murdock. But I still have to say that Collin Farrell as Bullseye steals the show. He not only made him a tea, but also made Bullseye a more interesting character than he in the comic book series. The R-rated director's cut also has a darker, darker margin for the film compared to PG. 13 rating as the original version has it. Expect more graphic fighting scenes, and much more profanity for the characters. Overall, I must say that this cut definitely does justice to comic book fans. If you do not have it in your collection, grab it. This DVD also has a good mini documentary on how the directors' cut was made.""",1

"b'Whenever a film films for ""realism,"" it usually opens the door to a predictable set of signifiers: portable cameras, real locations, a naturalistic lighting scheme, close dialogues, and tortured theatrics. In just two characteristics, Funny Ha Ha and the new Mutual Appreciation, screenwriter and director Andrew Bujalski reconfigured the language to something much closer to reality. His diy aesthetic and semi-improvisational dialogue earned him a frequent comparison with John Cassavetes, but he did not care so much about the sharp emotion; the characters in his films are clumsy and inexpressive, to the point of not saying what they feel, at least not without getting in the way of it first. Mutual appreciation is not much more than a refinement of Funny Ha Ha, following a similar group of people in their twenties, as they struggle with relationship problems and try to give their lives some strength. And yet, it is equally astonishing to watch, because Bujalski\'s style of stylized dialogue sounds genuinely imminent. The charismatic Justin Rice is a musician who moves to New York soon after his band finishes. It puts him in a strange place, since he must play at the end of the week. When she arrives in the city, Rice reconnects with her friend Bujalski, a good graduate student, and Bujalski\'s girlfriend, Rachel Clift, to whom Rice begins to develop an attraction (and, as it happens, mutual). Meanwhile, Rice meets a champion and more on attractive college radio DJ Seung-min Lee, but gets into trouble when he brings Lee\'s brother as his drummer and tries to distance himself from her romantically. All this intrigue creates a romantic mood. encounter between Rice and Clift, and a serious rupture in its relation with Bujalski, but nothing in Mutual Valor goes according to the usual script. The scene in which Rice and Clift finally vocalize their feelings for each other is the perfect example of what Bujalski does so well: any other romantic melodrama would bubble with passion, but these characters are painfully hesitant and compelling since they are cheating someone with whom they care. What ends up happening between them is completely unexpected, but entirely true to who they are and how the most caring people would act. But such things rarely happen on the screen, and Bujalski\'s willingness to follow him makes him a singular talent.'",1

"b'God this movie really has had my stomach on us for all its duration. As the atmospheric movies go this is certainly a masterpiece. It really is a chiller and it depends on mood and a mysterious atmosphere and not on sudden surprises and violence. The film is set in an old house in Jersey just after WWII. Nicole Kidman plays the owner of the house, living there with her two children all the while waiting for her husband to return home after the war. film three servants arrive to give assistance. These remain to be the only characters that are actually invited in the film. Nicole Kidman is excellent at role as are the two small children. Children suffer from a rare condition in that they ca not be exposed to any strong light. This brings the dark scenes where the film is almost totally set in grim candlelight. To prevent children from being exposed to any lights all doors in each room must be locked and unlocked at the entrance. movie is spent with panic opening and loss of these rooms as there is some strange presence in the house.In many ways, some of these scenes are quite reminiscent of scenes in The Sixth Sense. As the story unfolds the backgrounds for these servo char actors begin to unfold as well. This gives the film an incredibly intriguing feeling that has resulted in me feeling constantly at the limit throughout its duration. You never seem to be sure where all this story is taking - so the sense of mystery is enough. When they leave the house, the outside is covered with this almost surreal haze - again building the atmosphere beautifully. It reminded me of those Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes movies that used to scare me as a child. the sun would rise only to raise the atmosphere temporarily to give the viewer a little rest from all this tension. The rhythm really accumulates when the film comes to a very, very dramatic conclusion. Beautifully shot, really gothic, brilliantly represented and worth seeing.'",1

With all these great things, why would a company cut a great job like that? The six-hour version has already been shortened from the nine-hour game.

"b'Up there with ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles"" and ""There\'s Something About Mary"", there\'s my favorite comedy from Billy Murray. `` Goundhog Day \'\'. Murray (as TV Weatherman Phil Connors) is easily the solitary Hollywood star of the film, as the rest of the cast is much less known in the field. Andie MacDowell was probably best known for her modeling career in 1993, than as an actress ... she does a simply wonderful job as ""Rita,"" the TV producer. Chris Elliot does a great job in a less boring role than that of ""Larry"" the videographer (he\'s come a long way since it was David Letterman\'s ""The Man Under the Stairs""). The other actor who really impressed is the man with the recognizable face, but what is his name (Stephen Tobolowsky as life insurance salesman Ned `` Bing! \'\' Ryerson). Oh, and Scooter, the groundhog. As for the story, Bill Murray is trapped on the same cold day (which happens to be Groundhog Day) in Punxsutawney, PA, covering the now famous festivities. He continues to relive the same day, over and over again. Every day he sees the same things. Every day he meets the same people ... the man in the hall in the early morning, Doris the waitress, the mayor of the city, etc. He decides to get the best out of the situation and do whatever he wants ... just because he knows he\'s going to wake up the next day and will be all over again the same day. While getting tired of reliving the same day, Connors shifts his focus to Rita. First, trying to impress her. So, really trying to take care of her. When he finally passes by it, the spell is broken and the next day it appears. I classify some of Bill Murray\'s films as classics ... that is, `` Caddyshack \'\', `` Stripes \'\', `` Scrooged \'\', `` What About Bob \'\', etc ... but I put ` `Groundhog Day \'\' at the top of the list. Easy choice for my # 1 favorite movie Bill Murray. It\'s also an easy choice for one of my best 4 to 5 comedies of all time. *****'",1

The visual and auditory beauty brings comfort while watching it. The first part of the film takes place in 1951, when the French authority almost came to an end.

The father left home with another woman and took all the money a few times, but the mother would never blame him. Instead, the grandmother blamed her for not knowing how to please her own husband. In the second half of the movie, Mui moved to the house of a musician also as a servant. The musician, who is also his master, called Khuyen, was influenced by the French and knows how to play the piano. His house was decorated in French style, colorful and bright.

"b'With better direction and acting, I think * Foxy Brown * might have been a great movie. As it stands, it\'s basically a decent plot full of distractions caused by a horrific performance parade and outrageous fashion from the 70\'s (the latter, however, is almost a sufficient reason to watch the movie). despite his great boldness and confidence on the screen, seems tormented by the terrible delivery of his lines. (There are no successes, but there are several attempts to deliver a decent line.) Fortunately, however, Grier\'s inability to deliver is overshadowed by the terrible performance of Katheryn Loder, who could have given only one of the worst performances I\'ve ever done. seen by an actress. No one in the cast, however, seems particularly talented, with Juanja Brown being the best companion Claudia and Antonio Fargas as Foxy, perfectly incompetent, brother of the bandit, Link. It\'s still a decent movie, although it may not be one you want. to put a lot on your ""must see"" list.

"b""Welcome to The Rileys attracted me more and more as the movie progressed; at first I thought it was a little too slow, but when the pace increased with the New Orleans scene, I was quite impressed with what he had to say. The cast could not have been better; Melissa Leo gives an excellent performance as a guilty housewife punishing herself for a car accident has long since taken the life of her daughter; and James Gandolfini turns into a masterful performance as her husband Doug, who seems to have been unable to overcome her pain and her personal demons. Choreography and cinematography enhance the film, and the soundtrack does a great job of making the film even better. Lois Riley (Melissa Leo) and her husband Doug (James Gandolfini) are even more unhappy, though eight years have passed. years since the death of her daughter in a car accident. Lois has not left the house since the car accident; In fact, Lois was so depressed that she already has tombstones for her and Doug by the side of the grave of her deceased daughter, a fact that gives Doug shiver. Doug also has a longstanding affair with a waitress named Vivian (Eisa Davis). However, when Vivian dies suddenly of a heart attack, Doug is very upset and sad yet; and he suffers in silence because he does not know that Lois already knew about him and Vivian for a long time. Dugo goes to a business convention in New Orleans; and still upset over the death of Vivian (he wanted to take her to her birthday) and also feeling out of place in a very different city from where he lives with his wife, Doug leaves the convention one day and enters a band of striptease where he meets a minor program girl who goes through several different names, including Mallory (Kristen Stewart of Twilight fame). Doug and Mallory start an unconventional relationship; she reminds Doug of her daughter. So, what does Doug do? He calls Lois to say he's in New Orleans indefinitely without giving Lois any reason; he moves in with Mallory paying $ 100 a day to stay with her in his dilapidated apartment in a house that was abandoned after Hurricane Katrina and Doug desperately tries to make Mallory grow up with a combination of love and confrontation that Mallory needs. Meanwhile, Lois finally decides to leave her home after nearly eight years of home - she's determined to drive to New Orleans and find Doug there, calling her cell phone. Of course, the rest of what happens gives us a very solid story and good entertainment. I could tell you more; but there will be no spoilers here, although it may seem like I've told you a lot! Suffice it to say that the rest of the plot should hold your attention very well. In addition, look for very good performances by Tiffany Coty as Tara and Lance E. Nichols in a very brief presentation as Hamilton 'Ham' Watkins, another businessman at the convention. The DVD also comes with an extra about the making of the film. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in family drama or drama in general; and it is clear that fans of the actors in this film would do well to add this to their collections.""",1

It stars Angela Cartwright, Jonathan Winters, Joe Besser, Jerry Colonna and, of course, Shirley Temple. Compared to the Disney version of \'61 or \'62, this is a much weaker show. It is also not as good as the Laurel and Hardy version (also known as the March of the Wooden Soldiers) of the 1930\'s. The main value of this DVD is as an example of a simpler time when the television can easily escape values high school production) defines, minimal writing and acting, and call it entertainment. The plot bears little resemblance to any version of Babes in Toyland I saw. The dancers seem rehearsed, and the actors assault brazenly. Children\'s actors have to hold their laughter in the face of adult antics and failures. The Winnie the Pooh segment is a bit better, made with puppets by Bill and Cora Baird, who made the sequel ""Lonely Goatherd"" in Sound of Music. . It would be good for the children to watch.'",0
"b""This was possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and that's saying quite a lot. It's never a good sign when the best acting in a movie comes from hired prostitutes to act as, yes you guessed it, prostitutes. All the others just seemed to show up to win an easy paycheck, putting on the costumes and playing with the blood geysers during the so-called action sequences. The only saving grace was the fact that it was so bad you could not help laughing and wondering, was Michael Madsen really drunk all through the movie? If it's really true, it would go a long way to explaining how bad his performance was, and if that's the case, maybe the rest of the cast would be joining him quietly. Anyway, I've never played video games, so I can not compare it to that, all I can say is that as an independent movie, it was a waste of money.""",0

When an unblemished bomb left over from World War II goes out, local shopkeeper Stanley Holloway discovers an ancient treasure, including a mysterious document. An eccentric university professor (Margaret Rutherford) translates the document, and proves that Miramont Place was the site of a palace given to the exiled duke of Burgundy by King Edward IV, making the inhabitants of Miramont Place native to Burgundy rather than British.

"b""I usually hate anime. I'm the kind of person who complains every time I see a book turned into a movie, just because I do not think adaptations do justice to the original work. I'm a big fan of the manga, so I thought I'd give the anime a try. I was extremely shocked when I started watching. This show is as good as the manga. It follows the story line, with the addition / subtraction of some points of the plot and a different plot of Ouran Fair. Each of the voice actors (in English and Japanese) does justice to each character. The characters themselves are hilarious and diverse. The plot is fun. Do not let the pink cover fool you; this show is not at all feminine / shojo-y. The fact that I actually bought the series actually says something, especially since I watched the entire series twice through a friend before buying it on Amazon (and I'm super frugal). Since I bought it, I watched all the episodes at least two more times, my most favorite. This is a really must have. If I could, I would give this series a higher rating.""",1

"b""After all the hype about this movie I expected something completely different. The documentary was more about the White family and almost did not focus on Jesco. With The Dancing Outlaw, Jesco was the center of attention and seemed to be the worst in the family when it came to mental state, however, in this seems to be the only sensible. Documentaries are meant to excite emotion be it bliss, sadness. , hatred, love or whatever, documentaries are made for that reason. This one was completely successful, but not in the way I imagined. I could not help thinking how much misfortune this family is to D Ray White and West Virginia. They brag openly of firing on people, killing people, selling drugs, prescribing cheating and smelling pills in front of their newborn baby (which CPS strips, thank God). This upset me, but that's what this documentary should do. I loved it, I'm a big fan of Jesco White and I thought he was as good as The Dancing Outlaw. I feel that Dickhouse Pictures exploited this dysfunctional family in the name of 'Legacy', which I think is legitimate ... but not cool. I definitely recommend it completely, however it plays as part of the 'Intervention' episode, part COPS and part Gummo. At times it seemed a little fake, however, the fact that it was a real kind of shock for a second. If that makes sense. It's basically like a car accident. The soundtrack is also great with Hank III, Lefty Frizzell and GG Allin.""",1
"b'CHARLOTTE is sometimes a nocturnal film, a story that passes slowly through the lives of four people and with very few words says much about human relations, about the cocoons we create for security, for protection against fear, for hope the chrysalis metamorphoses into a butterfly or butterfly. Eric Byler should be commended for having the courage to keep this story simple - a tale of four personality ""disorders"" and how they find the means to exist in this strange world. Michael Idemoto is perhaps the most solitary outwardly, but all four characters seem to beg for connection and simply can not attach. Eugenia Yuan is the idiosyncratic girl, Jacquelyn Kim is the mysterious woman who, with Matt Westmore, is more of a catalytic agent than a character. All four actors are beautiful, sensitive and convincing. The lighting and settings are well chosen.

He does not know what to do. That's when golf pro Helen Hunt moves to the city and he immediately falls in love with her. I love Robert Altman.

"b'I believe that, in a few decades, film school students will study the history of American animation, the Iron Giant will be seen as the last great example of animation films traditionally hand-drawn before moving to computer animation. The thing about this movie is that when it was originally released in theaters, its promotion was so underfunded and simply bad, it was not very successful. Fortunately, it has dedicated followers on VHS and DVD. This film is an example of what animated films routinely perform in Japan, but rarely do here in the US. It\'s well written, visually stunning, and works for all ages, not just for kids. It has been warned that it may not be suitable for very young children. The climactic battle sequence features a potentially frightening transformation of the Iron Giant. Do not get me wrong, this movie is suitable for everyone, but younger viewers and younger children can probably handle it very well. But some children are more sensitive and nightmarish than others, so if you have children under the age of 6, I suggest you preview the movie before you let them see it. Some movies are better rented, others are better bought. This is the last category: it\'s a guardian! If you are an adult who has written animated films like ""kid stuff"" because they tend to be banal and stereotypical, you owe it to yourself to see this movie. Many reviewers are so easily satisfied that they appear unable to give less than 5 stars, which is a shame because this is a movie that deserves to stand out from the crowd, and absolutely earned it\'s 5 star rating.'",1

"b'After I saw this series on the shelves of my local library and saw that it was about an aspiring chef in 1900-1910 London, I picked up all the volumes. This series really surprised me: she has strong writing and attention to the scenery. . Louisa Trotter is a frank and outspoken chef who works in her profession and British society with lots of grease, understanding of human nature and a bit of luck. Gemma Jones is great as Louisa Trotter and the supporting cast is very solid as well. I was not sure if this series was a miniseries or a TV series, but it is somewhat Dickensian in that each episode is based on the previous one. And I can afford a series without a greater complement than saying that conflict resolutions are not trivial or superficial. Many allusions to historically accurate events, politicians, and contemporary culture are embedded in the tangles. I feel that I learned more about English classism and the social customs of the Duchess and the Bentinck Hotel than from my semester in London. If you like period drama (and comedy) and strong and nuanced heroines with lots of battles to fight then you will like ""The Duchess of Duke Street."" \'\' This series is the test of time. My only complaint is that I did not learn much about the culinary arts, but the writing is so up to standard that my complaint is presented as inconsequential. Although this series began filming in 1976, production figures make placement difficult. The Duchess of Duke Street is comparable in quality to the 1979 Pride and Prejudice of the BBC.'",1
"b'I tore the wrap of this little jewel this morning with the joy of a six-year-old delinquent who was given a one-day pass to a Cadburys candy factory. So I sat down to watch and left two hours later with the smile of a 51-year-old Cheshire cat on Viagra. We all know that ""The Italian Job"" is a 1960s classic, but what you do not know is that this fortieth anniversary reprint (published June 15, 2009 in the UK) is simply out of the charts ... First, the impression - which is GLORIOUS - is as pure as you could hope for and a joy from beginning to end. And although it does not state it on the outside, this is the fully restored version of the British Film Institute, which has been cleaned frame by frame (and clean outlets are used in the ""Making Of"" extras as well). One such feature is the reissue trailer for the 30th anniversary of 10 years ago, which uses the famous sequence of ""... doors off ..."". Untouched - it is covered in scratches and has no definition whatsoever - it lets you see how the material in the film looked, as opposed to how beautiful it looks now after the restoration. There are so many scenes that now stand out - like Matt Monro \'. The playful song ""On Days Like These"" hits and the car passes through the Alps on opening credits - when Charlie gets out of jail as he walks through the gates and Maggie Blye greets him in a car stolen from the Pakistani embassy - when the three Mini Coopers rise to the roof of the football stadium with the Italian police in pursuit - it\'s simply all beautiful. The BFI has also done `` Zulu \'\', `` The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner \'\' and `` Saturday Night and Sunday Morning \'\' and that\'s up to the same stunning standard as they are (see my comments). The extras are also generous (almost two hours worth): 1. Commentary with screenwriter Tony Kennedy Martin and author Matthew Field2. Comment by Michael Deeley and Matthew Field3. 4. ""Self Preservation Society: The Making Off The Italian Job"" (in HD) - features new interviews with cast, writers, producers including Michel Caine, Maggie Blye, Troy Kennedy Martin, Michael Deeley, reminiscences on Noel Coward, director Peter Collinson, Quincy Jones on legal scoreboard etc ... 5. Music Video (in HD) 6. The deleted scene with comment by author Matthew Field7. Theatrical Trailer8. Caine was perfect as Charlie Croker, the likely boy, Benny Hill as the coffin computer, the soft, deadly Raf Vallone as the head of the Turin Mafia and Tony Beckley as the elegantly dressed Camp Freddy. But the biggest blow of all was Noel Coward as Bridger - the master criminal serving his Majesty\'s penitentiary service. He has tea and cookies, cares about the British economy and has his cell full of photos of the queen. Coward is simply priceless as he commands the prison deck, ""Rule Britannia,"" played behind him by a string quartet - enough to make you howl with laughter ... You see you forget how funny the Italian is. Job is - the Catholic gay tailor saying that Charlie\'s pre-prison clothes could now be part of a museum exhibition, Coward next to two prison guards as they handed in their two newspapers and a toilet paper. The perplexing look of prison governor John Le Mesurier when Coward complains that ""his bathroom was invaded by Michael Caine (flinging the assault on him) - a man\'s bathroom is his castle ... The arrogant garage manager played beautifully John Clive counting the money that Michael Caine just gave him for taking care of his Aston Martin DB - he\'s been in his garage for two years while Caine was out in India.\'\'I was throwing old boy tigers ... \'\' Garage owner counting the fifties, `` there must have been a huge amount of tigers lord ... \'\' The sites of Turin are wonderfully colorful, the mountain scenes as crisp as those in the James Bond reissue and Caine\'s freckles clearer I\'ve reviewed a bunch of oldies on the new format BLU RAY of late - some successful, some pitiful - but that\'s up there with the best.In fact, as a man who loves me dium and believes in his possibilities, I suspect he will please Michael Caine Pink that his films ""Zulu"" and ""The Italian Job"" are going a long way towards establishing the BLU.

Lerner & Loewe\'s delightful soundtrack includes songs such as ""I Remember It Well,"" ""The Night They Invented Champagne,"" ""Thank Heaven For Little Girls,"" as well as the title track. ""Gigi"", sung with surprising sincerity and seriousness by Louis Jourdan. The three directors, Leslie Caron, Louis Jourdan and Maurice Chevalier, along with the sites of Paris, help maintain a typically French flavor, especially in the way the characters interact and interact. For all who commented on the political incorrectness of the story, a closer look will reveal the true feminist perspective of Colette\'s work, which was groundbreaking for the time: 1) History is a commentary on the limited social and economic options for history. women out of wedlock (or prostitution) at the turn of the century, 2) Although Gigi (Caron) never fully mastered her lessons and care, she is able to capture the heart of Gaston (Jourdan) precisely because of her imperfections. and 3) more important, it is Gaston instead of Gigi, who is forced to actually transform and challenge the social conventions of the time to bring history to its resolution. Compare this to My Fair Lady, which offers similar social commentary, but solves it in a more standardized way; although Professor Higgins finally notices his love for Eliza in the end, it is Eliza who is forced to submit her will by effecting a reconciliation that does nothing to solve any of the issues raised in the scenes that led to that point. Definitely watch Gigi and judge for yourself. (Be sure to watch only the widescreen version!) The full-screen version is awful, with whole characters cut out of some scenes, like Hermione Gingold\'s for most of the ""I Remember It Well"" sequel.)'",1

Terence Stamp plays the protagonist Wilson as a tough and sad English criminal who is trying to find out what happened to his daughter. Their search has generic fundamentals, but this movie rises above any gender label. A lot of credit has to go to the Lem Dobbs script, which avoids clich\xc3\xa9 and injects some worthy comedy into the mix. But the editing style of this movie is because I love it, it works on waves as memorys, it's the only movie I've seen that shows precisely how your mind can change from one thing to another. Right now, I'm looking like some jaw-buckled art student jumped on his own importance. But watch the movie and you'll see what I mean. The best part of this movie is that it's sad, the ending is not a big turnaround or some copout, it's just deeply sad, and there are not many movies that evoke that feeling in me today.

It assumes its identity, claims its tickets to America and, through destiny, falls into the romantic embrace of the American ambassador who is on the plane. Life is great until paparazzi photographer Antonio Banderas takes his elusive photo, announcing his presence to the abused bandits. From there, Rebecca looks for the left exit route, which gives her more money at any cost. The story is like a checklist of eroticism - there is voyeurism, a striptease, sad at the Cannes Film Festival. Brian De Palma does it all in style - split screen, sweeping camera angles - and it's fun to watch it in action - but still not enough to plug the holes in the story. The ending tries to pull all the dark themes of the film into a happy silver liner, but will leave you betrayed. Despite the power of the star, I did not like Femme Fatale. It's true that Rebecca was not blue - fans of her role as X-Men would not be disappointed. The character of Antonio Banderas had one or two interesting scenes, but most of the time he did what he was manipulated, with no original solutions out of his situation. Seeing him coming to a clever escape would have been a much better end - but, as it is, instead, the end drew on an exaggerated trick to get out of his somber end. Pass on Femme Fatale - even if you're looking for see Rebecca in a non-X-Men light. Despite all the brightness, it is not worth the investment.""",0
"b'Synopsis: John Ritter stars as Roy Knable, a true television addict whose life and marriage are crumbling around his ears while watching TV to get away from it all. The same night that his wife Helen (Pam Dawber) plans to leave him, a mysterious salesman named Spike (Jeffrey Jones) appears to sell Roy a new television set, complete with a gigantic satellite dish that radiates 666 channels direct to Roy \' s living room. However, something goes wrong when Roy and his wife are sucked into the satellite dish and enter the hellish world of TV Satan. From there, it\'s a frantic race to survive before time runs out. About the film: Stay Tuned is probably one of my favorite comic movies. I first saw it in the early 90\'s and when I saw it came out on DVD I jumped at the chance to get it. Stay tuned is filled with slapstick humor, a large number of very twisted comics plays on classic television clich\xc3\xa9; s and TV programs. Among them are Saturday Night Live, Star Trek The Next Generation, Three\'s Company, WWF and classic cartoons. The cartoon is presented in a wonderfully delightful animated sequence that was overseen in production by legendary animator Chuck Jones (who made many of the Bugs and Bugs designs). This is really the best of the movies that John Ritter starred in. Ritter\'s comic timing helps make this movie. Although this film has never been noticed, it is certainly a prime example of why John Ritter\'s comedic career has lasted more than two decades. He was very good as what he did. Comedian comedian Eugene Levy (""SCTV"" and ""American Pie"") also plays a major role in this film as Crowley, a down and out Hell TV Exec that helps the Knables on their journey. He manages to play the adorable charlatan quite amusing. Jeffrey Jones plays the villain, the CEO of Hell TV, Spike. He is a great actor for the villain in a comedy, and he manages to be convincingly wicked and funny at the same time without making the role look stupid, as tends to happen to bad guys in rude comedies these days. With John Ritter With comic timing and Pam Dawber playing the straight man as they fall from the demented channel to the demented channel, this movie is great for many laughs. About the DVD: Stay Tuned comes in a cardboard DVD case, marking it as a budget rate. It is presented in widescreen format with Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. Both the picture and the sound are very good. I did not notice any problems with anyone. The DVD comes translated into French (why not Spanish?) And has subtitles in English, French and Spanish. For special features, the DVD comes with an extended theatrical trailer, cast information and a feature look behind the scenes of the movie. The cast information is simply a list of actors in the film. They do not even provide bios for them, making it a clear case of reinforcing the content with the least effort. The featurette is the kind they used to show on television shortly before the movie\'s release, with cast interviews that are completely ignorant if you watched the movie. It\'s only slightly interesting. The downside is that the music that plays behind the commentator is completely annoying during the first quarter. This DVD release is a very simple and no frills release. Overall, a great movie on a bland DVD release. 4 stars'",1

"b""I'm not as articulate as some of the others reviewing here. All I can say is that we need this kind of entertainment so desperately. This series combines the various beliefs in the supernatural, the paranormal, the religion and the side of humanity that often lurks in the darkness of us because we lack the heart to accept who or what they are. This is a carnival full of freeks and geeks. Who will fight to the death for each other. This is a magical show in a desolate place. Which is perfect? The feeling of isolation only adds to the mystery and magic of this program. Freaks are real. And we managed to live among them for an hour at a time.

"b'If I did not say that before saying that again, I\'m a big fan of George A. Romero\'s Night of the Living Dead and its sequels he\'s done for the last forty years. Thanks to him, we really know the horrible world of zombies and the undead in great detail and we know what a scary place might get stuck inside, whether it\'s an old farmhouse, a suburban shopping mall, an underground bunker or anywhere leave it open. an attack of the carnideutas of the living. Of course, once you create a character so popular in Horror, you end up committing an impending copy of your original creation. Oddly enough though, most of these types of films had a varying degrees of success, especially the Italian Zombie filmmakers of the 1980s. Unfortunately, what started it all, the 1968 NOTLD due to copyright error never had this precious right and it soon became clear to everyone that anyone could release it, own it and / or make any version with that plot and title anyway they choose. But first, a bit of history: in 1998 Anchor Bay and John A. Russo (one of the men to help create the original 68 with Romero) decided to release a 30th anniversary version of the classic But instead of just re-releasing the same old impression as all other DVD companies, filmed and added new images to the old, creating a new subframe that not only harms the original movie, but betrays the social commentary that was established in the first place. A real misstep and the fans were not satisfied. However, when it comes to complete remakes, at least someone got it right before that. In 1990, with Romero\'s personal guidance and FX genius Tom Savini at the helm, they made a Night Of The Living Dead that stayed close to the original screenplay, giving the 90\'s audience an update that not only they could be proud of, but better in some aspects of blood values \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8band production. So, after a well-done remake and a learning error on what not to do for a classic, could it be done again? Apparently no . In 2006, with director Jeff ""Corman Wanna-Be"" Broadstreet in the chair, they decided to try again, of course without the necessary consent of Romero, but this time with a turnaround: Let\'s try to do in 3D! 3D? Same ? Sounds like a curious idea, but it really falls apart. To be honest, NOTLD3D is a farce. Shot on a nonexistent budget, this is the worst ""retelling"" of a movie since the 2001 Planet of the Apes. Of course, most of your favorite characters are here, but this time mixed up and played by actors who are so tough, it\'s hard to tell them of the real zombies. And the story is so slow and boring that it looks like a 3 AM view of something you\'d expect to see on the Sci-Fi Channel. Also, while the gore factor in the original 68 was minimal at best, 36 years later you still do not see much, if anything, but not for MPAA reasons but financially, and in fact half of me I asked why this was rated ""R"" in the first place? The new twists were lame, the flat sets and the special participation of the Horror icon, Sid Haig (which in my opinion is not a big deal in the first place) is completely unnecessary, which only helps in establishing that this was the best cash- ins of the cinema. So the main appeal has to be 3D, right? Wrong Instead of using the latest 3D technology of stereoscopic (which is with ""grayscale""), they were outdated Anaglyphic type (red / blue), which in turn turns the whole movie into a purple mess . And do not expect anything to ""jump"" for you. When it works, and it\'s rare, it just gives depth to the backgrounds, which means that your image looks deeper, not closer. It should also be noted, out of the features of the backstage, this entire disc is in 3D, which means that without the glasses, it is unattainable. There is no 2D version on the disc included as it should have been (this version is released separately), so once the glasses go, it is the definitive roller coaster. So to summarize, bad movie, bad 3D, bad idea. It was redone in 1990, and eight years later a trick was given that did not work, either. Even as a film alone, a film like Day Of The Dead 2: Contagium is a better movie. Hard to suggest, even if you\'re a complete one like me, NOTLD3D is a dead movie that should have been buried.

"b'First of all, I recommend the review below, by the guy named `` Sideburns. \'\' I think he captures the factual basis and spirit for this movie. I can understand how some who are ""Filipinos from Australia"" might want to see a purely Australian product, and that\'s not all. It\'s not ""Smash Palace"" or many other Australian films of that genre. What this movie is, can be described in one word: WEIRD. This is a good thing. The genius of Eric Roberts used to be (and still may be again), his ability to seemingly get lost in his roles, and do so while without any self-consciousness about how he stands. Watching this movie and then seeing other excellent (and weird) movies, including ""The Pope from Greenwich Village"" and ""Runaway Train"", is to see a career arc that was pretty amazing. He seemed to get into serious movies with great talent around him and then be able to take demanding roles (though, some similar, for sure) with power and command. Okay, for this movie. First of all, let\'s be honest, this is not a deep movie. Not to be. It\'s almost like a movie independent of a Farrely brothers movie, at least the first ones, where they do not mind taking risks and also having fun. There\'s also a good romantic subtext they\'ve had (`` Kingpin \'\' - believe it or not, `` Me, Myself & Irene \'\') where, in a ridiculous way, they reflect what\'s in a good majority of people. who are looking for love, or just looking for something in themselves, and they think this reflects either - in the case of the main characters in Farrely\'s films, and definitely in ""Coca Cola Kid"", slaughtered by others. I\'m not saying that Woody Harrelson or Jim Carrey could have been the Coca Cola Kid, but what they all have in common, in the specific roles they played in these movies, is to make someone wonder if anyone could or could find something remotely. interesting about them in a romantic way. They are so completely uninteresting, it seems almost caricatured - and then one only thinks of many people we all know, and it\'s not so unbelievable. The song in the movie alone is simply fantastic. Robert\'s character commissions from the Coca-Cola jingle are incredible, and it\'s punctuated by this Aboriginal guy who\'s playing his device - a guy Roberts discovers outside the local Coca Cola offices, and he\'s on duty. It\'s really fun to watch Kid\'s Mind\'s work - marketing wheels can help when he invents and employs his strategies. Everyone on both sides is equally ridiculed, and this creates a really good movie, usually without judgments (rare these days, huh?). There are other nice touches on the soundtrack and also, I would be remiss, not to mention the NUTS. , if I avoided the really cool scene of Greta Scaatchi, where she is recovering ... well, go see the movie! It\'s quirky, it\'s revealing and a lot of fun. It also does a great job to discuss cultural conflicts, where, when everyone is harmless, you can see how progress comes from a certain dissension, but you still wonder if we\'re missing out on the translation. If this is vague, then the film is in a way, and I think that is precisely why the director was going. Not everything has to fit perfectly. A lot does not, and it makes it look real.'",1
"b""The scary movie was one of the best comedies of 2000. With spoofs from films like Scream, I know what you did last summer, Blair Witch and The Matrix, this movie will be loved by everyone. The sexual content of the film makes it even more fun. (Not very explicit, shows very little). In the opening scene with Carmen Electra, you know this movie will be great. Shawn and Marlon Wayans did a great job putting together this movie and got the biggest cast. The total plot with Doofy is absurdly hilarious and you'll be laughing out loud at the end of this brilliant movie. So, do not forget to catch the scary movie. Anyone and everyone will enjoy this parody. Buy this DVD and enjoy. HAPPY VIEW!""",1

"b'Let me start by saying that I\'m not a beginner. So I can say with certainty that this is NOT FOR INITIATORS. Yes, I am screaming :) However, if you are a beginner, you can still use it if you pay close attention to what I am about to say. Women in particular do not use weight or weights of 2 to 3 pounds to the whole workout the first time you complete it. NO MORE THAN 3 POUNDS HIS FIRST TIME PLEASE! ! ! IF YOU WORKED BEFORE, NOT MORE THAN 5 POUNDS! ! ! Watch out for the swimming and butterfly movements. I think it\'s best to use NO weight for these 2 moves at the beginning. I recommend the above because most of the moves are done in speed, so if you\'ve worked before or not, some moves are too fast to keep a good shape particularly for a beginner. Also, too much pressure on the shoulders can overload the neck. After the first time you make this DVD, you can find out what weights you need and if you want to turn it off for some exercises that are a good idea. The coach is a bit annoying because he keeps calling him his first ""beginner"". \' work out . It is very annoying because it is not technically a beginner workout. Other than that, it can be a good workout for someone who has worked before and will slow down some of the movements and practice good forms. It\'s hard to know how to do this if you\'ve never worked before. Of course ""beginner"" does not necessarily mean it\'s your first training, but it may be for some. And remember, the BOB instructor insists it\'s your first beginner workout, so apparently he thinks a first timer can do that. With this, he should have advised the use of very light weights and had a modifier. I gave this DVD 2 stars because it is 2012 and there must have been several options on the menu to show modifications and a bit more explanation. In summary, a beginner can do it, but do not use more than 3 pounds your first time. And do not be discouraged if you can not do everything. Most beginners will not be able to do the whole thing the first time. Perhaps the BOB coach should change the name to the begoners because it will be intimidating to most beginners and many will probably get hurt if they do not know how to move and use the proper technique.'",0
"b""Of all the American films of Fritz Lang, SCARLET STREET is my favorite. And now, finally, it's available in a version that I can actually see.

SCARLET STREET is a remake of Jean Renoir's LA CHIENNE (The BITCH), and it would have been great if Kino could have released both titles as a Double Feature.

"b'It\'s my fault that I have higher expectations for this movie, but I\'m guessing this movie was not made exactly for guys like me anyway. The acting is good, the character of Matthew McConaughey, Ben and Kate Hudson, Andie really have to act and react. The dialogue does not matter. The character of Kate Hudson always has the right side, which is good for a while, but after an hour gets tiring. It completely invades every aspect of Ben\'s life; we never see Andie\'s world apart from her two friends and workplace. So while both characters have a similar agenda, there\'s a complete imbalance of weariness, and that to me is the biggest gap in the movie. He fights all her attempts at ""losing"" him, but all this only produces frustration in Andie - and feeds her to do crazier things. As a spectator, you\'re dying to see her fall on your face just once. But this is an illusion. Ben\'s resistance to Andie\'s antics hardly amuses me, and Andie\'s total disgrace does not please me. Of course both are great, and Hudson smiles positively when she smiles, but man, 112 minutes is a long time to support this game. I can imagine some people thinking that this movie is great. Girl Power and everything. I do not know . But I think we can agree that the film was conceived as a vehicle for Kate Hudson\'s rise to stardom. This film reminds me a little of WHAT WOMEN WANT (with Mel Gibson) for a variety of reasons, but notably because it was written and produced by women - which in the world of male-dominated filmmaking is a much-needed perspective - but Nancy Myers (a producer / director of What Women Want) is definitely much smarter than the ""brains"" behind How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days. You just have to watch the extras on the DVD to see proof of this. We met two of the producers, who obviously had facelifts. I\'m serious . It is scary . They talk about the material as if it were Shakespeare. Then there\'s director Donald Petrie, who is totally lacking in charisma. MAKING OF with it is so cheap that it\'s probably funnier to watch than most of the movie. While he is there talking, a TV monitor behind him shoots pictures of the movie, and an office worker (with his back to the camera) stares at a static PC screen while biting his nails and shakes his head a lot. She does this throughout the duration of the interviews with Petrie. Oh, and did I mention the background music that accompanies the extras? It\'s department store. Or elevator music. That you always hate more. I did not bother with the comment. Donald is a pain in the ass. There are no outtakes, which is now unusual for a comedy. The deleted scenes are really good, some honest emotions are shown by Andie and we have some quieter moments between the two tracks. Look, it started well. It looked like it would be harmless cute romantic comedy, but the romance lasted about 10 minutes. I can summarize my criticism with this remark from director Petrie because he was interested in directing the film. He says it was because he discovered Kate Hudson was attached to him. Aha So basically, if the film does well at the box office, then it will launch Hudson\'s career and career. Sorry Petrie, but that\'s not good enough for me.'",0
"b'A beautiful young woman suspects that her astronaut husband might have been radically altered by an astronaut in flight. Your partner has a suicide survivor and his partner\'s wife as well. She discovers that she is pregnant and, therefore, the stakes increase. Ultimately, a desperate CIA man struggles to spread the beans to her. Is he going to do this? She goes? There\'s suspense in this thriller / science fiction film; unfortunately, is not intentional. It\'s about figuring out when the movie will be full of suspense. We know everything from the beginning. We know what the husband\'s secret is and we know that the wife will eventually find out. The only possible payoff is that the director does what happens, when the character of Theron finally discovers, interesting. Unfortunately, she only discovered for about an hour and a half in a very shy two-hour film. How interesting could the rest be? You do the math. I absolutely love watching Charlize Theron, both for his obvious charisma and for his genuine dramatic ability. How she was sucked into this piece of drink can serve as a lesson to her. It\'s certainly a mystery to me why a woman who could have roles in ""Celebrity"" and ""Cider House Rules"" would select this script. Maybe she thought she could save him, since all the focus is on her character. She does not . The script and the direction made this simply impossible.

To solve their many self-imposed conundrums, work decays into insane fantasies, including silly special effects, as a simple resolution. Keith is of wood, manifestly uninspired by his role, but Belle is effective and Rhys-Davies's time is worthy of study, while the laurels of acting go to the superb Eastern Indian Roshan Seth, who easily dominates each of his scenes on the part of a shaman with extraordinary wisdom and magical powers.

"b'When Conan the Barbarian appeared on video in 1981, I was one of the first to achieve it. The movie has not lost its impact on me when I was 20, and it\'s way ahead of all those witchcraft and witchcraft movies that came in its wake, including the terrible sequel Conan the Destroyer. Why do I hold this? So high in my estimation? Certainly not in acting quality; when you have two bodybuilders, a surfer, a sports star and a dancer like five of the main actors in this movie, then you will not be taking classes - but again, this kind of movie does not need it. . But having said that they did a good job when the script required some excitement to be put into it. Grief, indecision, loyalty, friendship. It was all there. And revenge. Rematch is actually the thread that keeps the story together. To that end, co-writers John Milius (the director) and Oliver Stone should be applauded for not only dare to get out of the way of Robert E. Howard\'s books that gave the Conan world, but also to give us a coherent , neat and pleasant script that does not insult the intelligence (as opposed to the sequence). We have strong characters with whom you can sympathize and thugs that you readily want to get your mere deserts. Arnold Schwarzenegger in his film debut is perfect for the role as well as James Earl Jones as the main antagonist, the utterly evil Thulsa Doom who is so dominated by power that he promptly encourages a loyal follower to commit suicide just to prove a point to Conan . And follow the story is a high quality score written by Basil Polidouris. From the moment the opening credits begin, there is a deep and pulsating percussive sound that can take the viewer to another time and place, and make them believe that this is the song of that era. Mako\'s narration when the story is presented is unforgettable and I remember when I first heard it that it made my jaw drop. BANG! On come theme music. Gutsy, difficult and a delight. For me though, the only outstanding memory is the brilliant cinematography used when Conan is praying to his god, Crom, just before the final battle. He asks for revenge, while the camera runs with the hard cohorts of Thulsa Doom, the music in the background. Fantastic movie set, and one that can not be improved. This should never be redone because they could never do a better job. This has a great story, a great track, strong characters, unforgettable scenes, all sadly absent from the sequel. I\'m not bound by any loyalty to Robert E. Howard\'s fiction, so I do not worry about the fact that this movie strays from Conan\'s ""real"" world.'",1
"b'This film is a refreshing look at the novel, very European (albeit made American) and with fantastic chemistry. The unique, funny, (pseudo-) intellectual talk practically nonstop through the movie is great and the characters are believable. One would almost think that the actors were not following a script, but were just shaking it, discussing their ideas and real plans. While there may be some kitsch ""we\'re all stardust"" ... the character\'s reactions quickly correct any slippage in the reality of two young travelers in love with each other and for life. The scenes of Vienna, the Prater amusement park, the clubs and especially the scene in the cafe, are extremely true to life.

"b""It is quite difficult to review these films, for you must consider all the reasons why this film was bound to fail miserably. First of all, this is the continuation of the film Interview with the Vampire (though the third book in the series). As the second book in the series (The Vampire Lestat) was not made into a film, the producers of this film had to pack two books of history into a single film. That's one reason the film left out most of the two books (read the books, by the way). Secondly, this movie was a continuation of the extremely popular and successful Inteview With the Vampire, so of course repeating that formula would have been really impossible. One reason for this is that the previous film was released with some very big stars (Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas, Christian Slater) while the Queen of the Damned was climbed with just one: Aalyiah. The rest of the cast was relatively unknown (Stuart Townsend is not very well known from now on). All these problems aside, the movie itself is pretty awful. If you have read the book, you will be very disappointed, mainly because much of Rice's rich characterization is lost. None of the vampire's stories are revealed, more specifically the Gemini Legend, which is left totally out. The rest of the vampires are only glimpsed near the end of the movie, and are never referred to by name. Unless you have read the book, you will not be able to tell who is who. Another stupid point is that older vampires, for all their short on-screen time, wear the clothes from the time they were made, which is totally false in the book. Something that others might consider less is the disappointing lack of physical similarity that the characters have with their counterparts in the books. For example, Marius is described as a man in his forties, with long gray hair and a handsome face. Jesse is much older in the book, with very prominent red hair, and Armand's brief appearance is very wrong, because he looks more like Lestat. The only correct thing about Armand's physical appearance is his age: he's much younger here than in Vampire Interview because the books claim that Armand was turned vampire when he was 17. The only one that really seemed close to his description is Lestat. Stuart Townsend looked very much like my conception of Lestat, though his voice was too deep. Still, he did not look as good as Tom Cruise in that part. Physical resemblance is important because vampires are described as being very sexy and beautiful, and movies suffer from not accurately bringing these literary characters to the life of the movie. I really do not start with the inaccuracies with the book; there were too many. The main freedoms taken (apart from the absence of the other vampires) were the relationship with Marius and Lestat. Lestat was not made by Marius, as others have pointed out, and Marius as portrayed as an evil vampire, while in the book he is Lestat's mentor and he only kills evil men. The ending is totally different and impossible to compare and contrast here (read the books). The main reason I think it failed is that the film sacrificed a rich history for references to pop culture. More is made from the soundtrack of this film and Lestat's brief career as a nu-metal star than anything else, even history. For the reasons I described at the beginning of this review, I think the filmmakers were doomed to repeat the success of Interview with the Vampire, but that's no excuse to even make an effort. Producers try to make excuses, especially with cut scenes, where they try to explain why they cut more images of other vampires. In conclusion, Queen of the Damned is a miserable failure, mostly for giving up a rich and exciting history for pop culture references. As I said, it would have been impossible to repeat the success of the old vampire movie, but this movie is too horrible to support itself.""",0
"b'I loved Saturday Night Fever when I saw it many years ago and it\'s still my favorite movie. A common misconception is that it is a Disco movie or a musical (like Grease). Saturday Night Fever is hard, sometimes rude and violent looks at the world of young working class and club life in the 70s (I was also a bit young at the time of the launch of Fever to join clubs, but was similar in the pre-world -AIDS from the beginning of the 1980s when I started to dance. Violence, sex and curses are REAL ... that\'s how it is (and kind of ... without the bee\'s being !!) for those in Brooklyn (and other places in NY) John Badham did an excellent job of putting the life of a lost 19 year old person who lived for the dance club on Saturday night because everything in his life was frustrating and got nowhere (Remember the lines: ""You\'re a clich\xc3\xa9, your place is not on your way, it\'s not a place?"")

"b""You'd think a movie with such a star-studded cast would have some redeeming qualities, but that one does not. The characters are flat and provide no reason for the audience to become emotionally attached. Zeta-Jones self-centered starlet character is dreadful and monotonous, depressed John Cusacks and lonely character is unbelievable and impossible to cling to, Billy Crystal's press agent who tries to please everyone's character is not funny nore engaging and character of Julia Robert seems be present only because she has a big smile. The high point, if you can call it, is the foreign lover character of Hank Azaria. His character is horribly stereotyped, but at least he acts a little when speaking in an accent (even though the accent is exaggerated). Even Christopher Walken, who is good at almost everything, is lost in this movie. Your little film role does not even make sense - there's nothing in the movie that gives clues to the end where Walken's character plays a big role. The main point of the film - will be Zeta - Jone's character and the character of John Cusack are back together? - is completely lost because they simply do not have amount of chemistry together on the screen. His performance is completely flat. This movie is disappointing even when compared to all the other more romantic comedies. One last note - the Doberman's gag would be funny and appropriate for third graders if it were not for the fact that Crystal's character seems to enjoy being licked in the groin by a dog. He even tells the dog where to lick. That's not funny - it's just disturbing.""",0

"b'After buying all available copies of this movie on the market, please take my advice - DO NOT BOTHER! Obviously there is no decent copy of this movie currently available.

I know, he funds all of them himself through some kind of bizarre German fund, but even so, his ability to keep making movies despite absolute and complete failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe. It would not be so bad except that video game developers keep giving their best properties to this guy. I really enjoyed the Alone in the Dark series of games. Even the newest, the New Nightmare, was good for a few hours of gameplay. There was a good movie to be made from the adventures of Edward Carnby, but that's not it. Now Uwe Boll got his hands on Bloodrayne and Hunter: the Reckoning. What comes next, Silent Hill? Doom? I can only imagine the track that this guy will cut through adaptations from game to movie if he is not stopped. Someone needs to take out their line of credit, or these video game publishers need to understand and realize that when they make a bad movie of a game that kills the franchise, no one is more interested in that title. Think about it, is House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark a viable game title anymore? No way . A new House of the Dead game comes out on XBox and no one will mind. The title is dead and all because of Uwe Boll. So if any of you out there working for a game publisher, meeting a game publisher, or having access to a game publisher ... please let them know. This movie itself is not even worth reviewing. I can not separate what I did not like from this dung heap from the rest. Literally, all about it sucks. Writing, acting, music, CG effects, editing. I thought that if I waited until it came out on DVD and then rented with low expectations, I would not be disappointed. Even the $ 5 you spend on this DVD, if you buy it used by one of Amazon's sellers, is too much. You will regret it. This movie is just a bunch of Boll.""",0

Greg's interview is a welcome treatment after watching the painful interview with John Lydon, who is typical of John Lydon. Yellow teeth rotting, horrible, rancid and difficult.

At one point the guitarist goes through the audience and falls completely over a senior gentleman who probably did not realize which show he had bought tickets for.

The bass is thin and the vox often overshadows the instruments, but the performances more than make up for it.

"b'Harvey Pekar\'s comic book, American Splendor, pioneered a new genre: the autobiographical comic book. At first glance, the everyday happenings of a Cleveland archivist seem hardly the material for an interesting film. Fortunately, filmmakers Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman are able to take what was funny, heart-wrenching and fascinating about Pekar\'s life and successfully adapt the page panes to the big screen. Like Ghost World, American Splendor is a champion of outsiders who do not fit into society. In a beautiful twist, a mini-comic comes with the DVD that briefly recounts Pekar\'s experience of having his story on film. The disc itself features an engaging audio commentary with the real Harvey Pekar, his wife Joyce, his daughter Danielle, his friend Toby Radloff, filmmakers Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman, and actor Paul Giamatti. Everyone has a great time on this track as they play and reminisce about the film and its experiences. ""Road to Splendor"" is a brief update on what Harvey has been doing since the movie was made. The song ""American Splendor"" by Eytan Mirsky, which was presented in the film, can be heard in its entirety. . His vocals sound eerily like Evan Giving from the Lemonheads. Finally, there is a trailer for the movie. American Splendor has the same ironic and melancholic sense of humor as Ghost World, another excellent film adaptation of an independent comic book. American Splendor holds true to Pekar\'s vision - he refuses to sentimentalize his life, even in the emotional conclusion of the movie that is genuinely moving. It is one of the best comic book adaptations of all time because it remains true to its source material and wisely involves its creator in the process of transferring his story from page to screen.'",1
"b'The film is a strange animal, alright, a work without genre, and sometimes Gordon seems to have overcome, seeking effects he is not able to achieve. The various styles, moods and genres give the film a slightly gaudy and amateurish feel, but in the end (perhaps consciously on Gordon\'s part), this embarrassment works in favor of the film. The Singing Detective is remarkably naive, fresh and daring, almost childish in its lack of pretentiousness and easily one of the most original American films of the last twenty years. Above all, it shows Robert Downey Jr.\'s infuriated and pulpy flesh writer, within whose head the whole (or so) movie takes place, and Downey makes a creative and powerful performance, which may be the apotheosis of his life. enormous talent. Despite praise for Downey, at its launch, Gordon\'s film found a wall of critical resistance, a veritable conspiracy of contempt. This may have been due in part (at least in the UK) to a fondness for Potter\'s original TV series; but perhaps it was due even more to the basic incompatibility of Potter\'s idiosyncratic and blunt vision with the main (critical) tastes. Whatever the case, the film once again failed tragically in finding its audience. With his earlier adaptations, Gordon respected the source material without reverencing him, and as a director, he has a rare gift: the ability to fuse his own sensibilities and talents. with your subject at a fundamental level. In The Singing Detective\'s case, it was a slightly less perfect merger; Potter\'s vision (his bizarre blend of musical fantasy and gloomy psychological realism) was so surprisingly original that it required another sensitivity at least as strong and eccentric to merge. Gordon does not (yet) have the surrealistic gifts to make Potter\'s vision his own, or to take it to the next level (David Lynch may be the only capable director). He is a proficient director in every way, and seems to be blessed with a natural relationship with the actors (perhaps why so many good people want to work with him). However, Gordon is not a visionary director, and this was a visionary script. Fortunately, he had a visionary actor at a career peak to take the slack, and Downey bears the day. The Canto Detective is not a masterpiece; is flawed and fractured and sometimes thin, even easy and occasionally redundant (more especially in pseudo-noir sequences). But it is an imaginative and fearless work of art, an admirably eccentric work that manages to do something like justice to a brilliant piece of writing. Filled with inventive delights and heartfelt touches, it leaves most other recent American films in the dust. However, it failed, both in the UK and the US, being so poorly revised that many people (myself included) let it pass, suspicious of the stench of failure. It turns out that the bad smells did not come from the film, but from critics very corrupt and tired of recognizing a work of art when they saw it.

"b'Seeing this musical on a New York stage is an unforgettable experience and I went to see it four times. But watching him at the movies is a totally flat experience.

The musical is a brave story based on humid, village-filled environments filled with interesting locals. On the edge . Since I lived in New York for 30 years, I immediately felt at home with this hidden world that the average person can not imagine. But spending two hours in a movie theater, watching this depressing and depressing story, is a grim experience. The musical numbers seem all forced. The people are not very friendly. They are very dramatic and intense for the comfort zone and the reason the movie bombed, is that America in the middle probably could not understand why the people in this movie did not pay the damn rent - and avoid all the drama and problems! This movie went very well in the big cities, where there were people who identified with this bona fide story of tragedy and Aids. But even for someone like me who is very familiar with this world, which happens in the Village where I used to live, it is a gloomy and depressing experience with too little to feel optimistic about. I could not sympathize with the drug addicts and the prostheses nor any of the musical numbers electrified.

"b'""The Exorcist,"" by William Friedkin, is a landmark. The cultural psyche is still recovering from its arrival on the scene more than thirty years ago. It is a masterpiece that will continue to linger long after many of today\'s horror films are forgotten. The actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) seeks the help of Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) after his daughter Regan (Linda Blair) begins to behave strangely. After realizing that something is terribly wrong with the young woman, Father Lankester Merrin (Max von Sydow) is summoned to perform an exorcism on her. A terrible battle between the forces of good and evil happens, then, pushing everyone involved to their physical and spiritual breakpoints. Words can not effectively convey the power of ""The Exorcist."" \'\' This is a movie that relentlessly attacks the senses and does not apologize for it. The ensuing genre entries had no choice but to follow suit, because, on their own, they redefined what the public understood to be cinematic terror. While Linda Blair deservedly deserves great attention for her fine work, Jason Miller\'s equally powerful performance as Father Karras should not be neglected. It gives the film an important human component that holds it firm. Without Karras\' bow, ""The Exorcist"" is just another screaming movie trying to make money fast, relying on cheap thrills. Truly groundbreaking, ""The Exorcist"" is a stunning work that dared to test the limits of cinema. No serious discussion about the great cinema is complete without mentioning it.'",1

"b'WOW . This movie was so inspiring for a few reasons. One was a quality and uplifting film about an African-American father - so rare to see in movies. Secondly, he offered me security and hope that, just because I am distressed for a long time, this does not bother me. Much of what this father has illustrated in regret, I am struggling with it. It was so refreshing not to have heard the name of God destroyed in this movie, as it seems to be the norm of the actors today. Very powerful . Thank you amazon.'",1
"b'This 90-minute PBS DVD is a bit confused, but still a very good and fun performance. The PCBS station in Cookeville, TN, recorded a series of concerts at the Volcano Hall in Cumberland Caverns, 333 feet below ground level. The DVD brings together performances from 10 musicians or bands that best fit the ""American"" title. Some are best described as `` bluegrass \'\', including the well-known Ricky Skaggs and the Cherryholmes family group. Singer / songwriter Darrell Scott and Steve Earle\'s son, Justin Townes Earle (both of whom I love) are best rated as ""American."" The young band 18 South mixes country and bluegrass, while Will Hoge is closer to rock than anything. Based on the age of her appearance and the music she makes, I imagine - even though this DVD is from 2011, JT Earle\'s clip was recorded about four years ago. I could not identify the others. The performances were recorded with a live audience and it\'s kind of cool to see the Caves rocks in the background but as the musicians are so well done, I\'m not sure if it makes the sound better or different. There are no actual presentations; the artist is identified by a title on the screen. So there is no fill here. I enjoyed seeing artists I know and love (if you have not seen the Black Gospel\'s blackest singer - Mike Farris - this is your chance!) But I also discovered some new ones. I - for one - I would like to see a follow up to this DVD. I hope you found this review informative and helpful. Steve Ramm \'\' Anything Phonographic \'\''",1
"b""There are those who criticize JFK, claiming that Oliver Stone disregarded the facts and rewrote the story. True or not, that loses the point completely. Stone himself said that his intention in making the film was to make his audience question authority and think for himself. The film is presented as a POSSIBLE explanation (a combination of two separate theories) for the unusual events leading up to the Kennedy assassination, and actually raises more questions than answers. The cast is phenomenal. The award-winning cinematography and editing are innovative to say the least. Despite his take on JFK's politics, the film is one of the few that I would say is perfect. It's the reason I'm a filmmaker and it's worth every second that you spend watching. You'll never forget that.""",1

"b'First of all, I want to inform you that I am a huge Recess fan. So this comes from the perspective of a fan. So you really want to know what that is? This is like the ""Miracle On Third Street"" DVD, with which the real stories are kept together. There are 4 real stories (3 have seen TV episodes) and only a new episode of 13 minutes. It starts when TJ and his gang return to the old abandoned playground at the back of the playground and are caught by the kindergarteners. They are held as ""hostage"" by the new boss named Chief Stinky and the gang tries to tell them stories about their experiences with the kindergarteners and then Gus tells when the gang was kindergarteners (the new episode.) The three episodes already seen are ""The Legend of Big Kid"", ""Wild Child"" and ""The Kindergarten Derby"". \'\' The bonus DVD episodes titled as \'\' Fans \'\' 3 favorite episodes \'\' are: The Challenge, The Whomps Story and One Got Clean. * I kind of doubt that they are the most favorite, because I know that `` The Experiment \'\' is very popular among fans, because that\'s when TJ and Spinelli kiss. Also if you wonder why Gus is on the cover when he supposedly came in. Third street in 4th grade. Well on the DVD, Gus went to Third Street during kindergarten, but only for a few weeks and only he remembers the kindergarten, while the rest of the class does not remember anything about the year that explains why Gus is on the cover. You will notice that the voices of TJ and Mikey are different (not too different or annoying, but it is noticeable) because the voices of the original voice actors have become very deep. Anyway, when I bought this DVD I thought it would be an adventure of an hour of history when TJ and his gang were kindergarteners ... but unfortunately it was not. It was really pathetic of Disney to do that and give such a careless bit of episodes ""already seen on TV"". I only gave 2 stars because of the new episode. If you bought `` Miracle on Third Street \'\' and were disappointed, I do not think you would want that. If you are a new fan, and you have not seen all the episodes ... then this is a great DVD for you to follow! If you are a parent and consider it a simple whimisical entertainment for your child, I HIGHLY suggest this, but the DVD and episodes are hilarious, but they can also have good messages of friendship and believe in yourself, and so on. I know most kids like this because my younger cousins \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b(around 8-12 years old) like cartoons and can relate to the characters in school. Hope this helps you!'",0
"b""Dumas's stories have been filmed so often, but it's still a joy to see them. This new version of the Count of Monte Christo is no exception. It has serious defects and errors, too many to list. For example: modern lines of language, totally unbelievable interpretations (as other reviewers have mentioned), very amateur characterizations (the earl turns his hair and his old love recognizes him by the gesture and not by his almost unchanged appearance). None of these things really pissed me off. I just sat down and enjoyed it. The opening scene set the mood and the picture usually showed great settings. The ending was incredibly mellow, but since I had just watched a wonderful fight / fencing scene with a lush green backdrop, I did not care much. A loud complaint about most new movies: voices are almost inaudible compared for background music and noises.I hope you read the book if you have not already. No movie has ever made Dumas's story telling justice to power. The film version of the Three Musketeers with Michael York as D'Artagnan came close. If you're willing to have fun, this movie may fit your mood. I've seen this three times so far.""",1

After talking to a backwoods trucker because their jeep breaks in the Utah desert, the terrifying fun begins. As in Spielberg\'s duel, malevolence comes to look like a big truck. The truck driver named Red (JT. Walsh) agrees to give Amy a ride to the nearest pay phone while Jeff gets the car. Now, it\'s easy to imagine why Jeff would let his wife out with a total stranger. in an 18-wheeler, but put yourself in the same situation and you would probably do the same thing.

"b""Robocop 2 is probably the most underrated and most harshly criticized sequel in history (tying with Predator 2, which came out the same year). Because of some missing elements of the first and a little more cartoon for the violence, critics and the public were not satisfied and the opinions and feelings about the franchise failed with the simply horrible Robocop 3. Make no mistake about a good movie though. Robocop 2 still has the same wild sense of humor, cynical social commentary and pathetic character of the first film. It is a hyper-realistic vision of an America populated by gun-loving psychopaths, a democracy owned by big business, and the miserable junkies who are trafficked to them by hawkers, believing it to be the second coming of Christ. be the typical way of describing it. Completely-over-the-top would be more appropriate. Empire Strikes Back director Irvin Kershner clashes with so much sadistic violence, deafening shots, endless destruction and loss of human lives that the film just begs you not to take it seriously. Some of the blame was put on writer Frank Miller for the film being more caricature than the original. I do not think that's very fair. I read Miller's original script when I was in high school and it's quite different and, I daresay, it's not applicable. Robocop 2 himself was not the Nuke Lord Caine, the hippie psycho with delirium of divinity. His name was Kong, a psychotic cop who practically killed everyone he encountered. Sergeant Reed and the Old Man died and there was not much humor. Screenwriter Walon Green has been hired to dictate the script and much of what appears on screen is actually his job. Frank Miller's original ideas are virtually left behind as the structure of the entire film and part of his story has been recycled to Robocop 3 (do not blame him for that either). Miller was obviously upset about this, but it was still a sport good enough to appear in the film (keep an eye on him playing Doctor Frank), although he promised not to work in Hollywood again for fear of being taken advantage of. Until Robert Rodriguez promised to make a success in his graphic novels Sin City.Verhoven may be gone, but Irvin Kershner struggles to deliver the same mix of joy and magic and really hit it. Basil Poledouris' ghastly score has also disappeared (he returns in Robocop 3), but the new composer Leonard Rosenman creates a wonderfully heroic and optimistic theme that fits the film more than the poisedour soundtrack of Poledouris in the first film.Filmado m\xc3\xa1s once in Texas, Houston this time, you really have to feel for Peter Weller walking in that Robosuit. It must have weighed a ton and it would be sweating inside loads. There is a particular scene in the film in which Murphy is tortured in near death / destruction which is very difficult to watch. But that leads him to get a brand new makeover and these crazy new directives placed in his head. The part where he gives a lecture to the Little League boys and reprimands the young people who play with the leak (after citing some very suspicious philosophies) is hilarious. Robocop 2 is a great movie. Despite the problems with the script, the story and some slightly dated stop motion effects, it's a brilliant sequence that meets expectations. Listen to the most talkative. I do not know what kind of movie they were expecting. And thanks for not smoking! The DVD is at 1.85: 1 widescreen anamorphic widescreen color (check out Robo's armor chrome) and Dolby 5.1 sound. I'm a little sad that there are no extras as a comment, because I really want to hear what Kershner has to say about the movie. And there are deleted scenes that I know of that made Murphy visit his grave and some more details about why Caine is so weird. We can only hope that in the future ...""",1

"b'This 30-year anniversary edition takes the original Night of the Living Dead movie and launches a new soundtrack and new scenes. As far as I was concerned, the original film was perfect as it is and this was unnecessary, however I decided to be open-minded and give this edition a chance considering that the new material was written by John Russo (who co- original film) and has photography (and acting) by Hinzman (who also helped create the original). I was completely disappointed. The new scenes include a new introduction, varied scenes of zombies marching and being killed by hillbilly, and a new epilogue. The various scenes sometimes interfere with the flow of the film, the makeup is less effective and some of the new extras are terrible. They do a decent job of editing in the new scenes, but they are still remarkable (for example, the fashions are not quite right). The new introduction and epilogue are ridiculous. The introduction just states that the lead zombie (played by Hinzman) was a criminal when alive. This takes one of the movies the most effective elements: that zombies can be your neighbor or a close friend or relative, but they will still try to kill you. Hinzman is obviously older in the front photos (the profiles are fine). When he starts attacking two gravediggers, one of the ""actors"" starts to flee and realizes that Hinzman should catch him first, so he actually goes back to the coffin and leans so that Hinzman can catch him! ! ! The fact that they did not make a second attempt shows a lack of care. The epilogue is a ""one year later"" with an insane preacher of hell and sulfur who survived the carnage. He\'s stuck in the middle (spoiler warning) of the Duane Jones scene being killed and the final credits showing the rednecks eliminating his body! ! Talk about interfering with a very effective ending! You have the option to watch the original cut (in a great print), but you can only watch it with the new soundtrack! The old soundtrack was made up of library music, but it worked out great. At best, the new soundtrack is mediocre. Sometimes this does not even fit the mood of the scene, for example, being frenetic when the action is calmer and depressing. The booklet contains interviews consisting mostly of actors talking about how ""flawless"" new scenes have been added and how many old fans will love the new (wrong) version. There\'s a fun commentary track, but you get the same people (plus others, including Romero), giving you the same information in the comment bands of the much higher Elite Millennium Edition.'",0
"b'I really wanted to enjoy this movie. I kept hoping that somehow it would ""catch on"" and stand up. Unfortunately that never happened, and in fact kind of gave way to a bizarre nothingness somewhere in the middle. Basically, this is a cynical paranormal writer staying in a hotel room where all sorts of bad things have happened over the years. It\'s really? That\'s about it. However, there was a lot to work on in history. It could have been deeper, the plot more involved. The characters could have been much more than they were. This film is a miscellany of loose ends, mostly nebulous, that are never tied. It moves in a rhythm of snails and you wait for something that never happens. The ending is unbelievable and invented. However, the special effects are very good.'",0
"b'This movie is a total joke! You\'d think, looking at the poster, that it\'s action-packed and impressive like ""the underworld"" or ""Resident Evil."" NO ! ! The actors were super slow with the fight scenes (as if they were practicing) and the dialogues were stupid. Waste of talent for Ben Kingsley (which is always good as we all know). You can not tell if the scenario is in England or the US because the actors can not decide with their accents. Waste of money and time ..'",0

"b'I was very disappointed with how far this film departs from the real story! It\'s ""more or less"" Prince Caspian, but it lacks many important elements. First, they left Aslam almost entirely to the end. Those who are familiar with the book will remember that Aslan is the most important part of the strength and development of the story. It was he who called the children to Narnia for their purpose, a plan. Half the book is about Aslan and the kids, so the fact that they have let their importance out of the movie really spoils the story. Not Aslan, nor Narnia! There are a number of other aspects that are not about the book, but some of them could be more easily overlooked if they had not strayed from the true ""Heart"" of history. The other big disappointment for me was how they changed Peter\'s character. Your whole attitude has changed. You never get a chance to warm up with him, and in the end, he\'s almost glad he did not return to Narnia. (The same can be said of Susan.) The plot seemed very weak, and the relationship they tried to create between Caspian and Susan was totally unnecessary and I felt, it helped a lot in ruining the film as well. But if you\'re not interested in the story\'s fidelity, ""Prince Caspian"" by Andrew Adamson is an action-packed adventure with many wonderful visual and special effects. However, I recommend you read the story. The book has much more wealth and purpose. I wish they had stayed in this story, just like they had the ""Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe."" I hope they do better in ""The Journey of the Dawn Treader."" We will see ... ! These are just a few of my thoughts. Needless to say, I feel like they could have made this movie so much better.'",0

"b'This documentary is BS total. The facts and opinions are totally wrong. I doubt that anyone who has been responsible for it has even read a single book about Gettysburg. Heth\'s troops opened the battle, not Early. Little Roundtop was the most important battle feature on the second day, not Culp Hill. `` Save the Union. \'\' In fact, Grant\'s victory in Vicksburg did more to end the Civil War than the battle at Gettysburg. If Meade had lost there, he would have taken refuge in the ineffable defenses of Washington and expected the army of Grant to push Lee away from the district. I read in many books about Gettysburg that Lincoln was furious because Meade did not follow the battle by persuading Lee. His statements about the ""discovery"" of a handwritten telegram on this and subsequent opinions were absurd. In fact, these four ""facts"" are just the beginning. Even the address material was silly. Avoid this garbage.'",0
"b""This is one of those rare movies that completely captures teenage girls in a funny and honest way. Enid and Rebecca are two misfits who have just graduated from high school. While Rebecca gets a job to try to fix her own apartment and move on into adulthood, Enid is still struggling to find her place in a new world. This is obvious from his reluctance to get a job and move on. After making a joke with an older, lonely man, she eventually becomes a friend of his as she walks away from Rebecca. Enid is a character who sometimes gets angry but at the same time understands that she is having trouble moving forward life and feel empathy for. She has a lot of talent, but she has no idea what exactly she wants to do. Then she turns to the outcasts like the crazy old man who sits waiting for a bus that never comes and the older Seymour. This movie is often sad but hilarious as well. You're always wondering where this movie is going to take you. By the end is the perfect touch, although some may not care about it. It's a great movie that is really real and honest. These are not cardboard characters, they are real girls. In conclusion, it deserves all the buzzing.

"b'Interview with a vampire was an excellent film, beautifully done based on an incredible idea. The Queen of the Damned illustrates, at the very least, that Anne Rice is a wonderfully creative author, but I discovered that this cinematic version of one of her books was very boring, with many fine characters. The vampire Lestat (beautifully played by Stuart Townsend) decides to get out of retirement, which is actually a sleep of several hundred years. He gives a great insight into the world of vampires - you know you hate light, garlic and all things sacred; loves dark, blood attractive young ladies necks and eerrr `` Nu-Metal! ""But what bothers him the most is that he is immortal. I mean, he does not age, he seems to have unlimited financial resources - but he\'s so bored with life. Sounds like a kind of vampire brat, spoiled to me! So he thinks that if he can totally provoke all the other vampires, then maybe they\'ll be so enraged to get him out of this eternal misery - and who\'s better at work than the ""Queen of the Damned""? or Aaliyah for us. As he teases them and she, well, he becomes the lead singer of the world\'s biggest and most controversial Nu-Metal band. Hey, I definitely would be with all the other vampires. There are interesting aspects in this film - how he became a vampire and how he dealt with it is quite fascinating. In addition, everything is filmed using typical gothic images and colors. The monologue of his thoughts is full of comic irony and is delivered wonderfully. Some of the subtle interactions between the characters are also hilarious. Aaliyah looks amazing in her role as the queen of all vampires, she really has a presence on screen and what tragedy her career as an actress and musician has been interrupted. The conflicts between vampires and vampires that happen during the film are also very original. Unfortunately, none of the effects is particularly spectacular. Overall, although the idea is good, the development and plot are too weak to make this movie truly memorable.'",0
"b'This is a 1970s horror movie based on the bestselling book of the ""true"" story of a haunted house on Long Island. It was denied and proved to be a total farce, but the film spawned about ten sequels and even that necessary remake. The Lutz family buys the house of their dreams only to discover it is haunted, and also contains the passage to hell in the basement. Yes, it is completely and utterly overwhelming to think that if such a passage existed in something called Hell, it would be in Amityville, Long Island. James Brolin plays the husband, tough guy with lots of hair. Margot Kidder is the wife, who can react with big, wide eyes whenever she witnesses a ghost, hallucination, atrocities, etc. Most of the scares are really opening doors or something, looking at something, and then the music gets really loud, and then we see people\'s eyes, closer, and then, da da! A special cheese effect. Good for the value of nostalgia. The appearance of Rod Steiger as a crazed priest is a great advantage. Like a cheap exorcist. If these types of movies scare you, it may be worth it on a slow night. Good for some unintentional laughter too.'",0

"b""The war against humanity is at its peak. The planet Roku San is at its most difficult point. With military support dwindling, soldiers dying daily, and with new insects constantly revealing themselves to the world, how will humanity survive, if not without you? The Federation is currently looking for men and women to help counter this terror. How would you like to be a hero, and how would you like to become a citizen while you're at it? Would you like to know more ? STARSHOOP TROOPERS as a series became notoriously known, even though the second film did not contribute to the plot of the first film. With little hope in mind, I began to watch STARSHOOP TROOPERS: MARAUDER hoping that somehow it would be better than the second, and maybe as good as the first. Honestly, deception takes the reins and throws me back a step. with STARSHIP TROOPERS 3. Set of the planet Roku San and following our original hero, Johnny Rico, the film soon shows little hope when we learn about some of his characters. Johnny Rico, experienced in his new years in the army, has always been known not to follow orders, but in the case of death? The sky marshal, one of Earth's most famous men, is a pop star? And the soldiers who would not normally become star-studded, are in love with the presence of a singer, often enough to completely disobey orders and ignore the outside threat? What does the series come too, if not a total factor of cheese? Unfortunately, this does not diminish any time soon. With a plot based mostly on an Angelina Jolie actress, Jolene Blalock, who heads a small group of people in the Roku San desert, the movie ends up falling, turning into an exaggerated attempt at a science fiction movie. PROS: - Some actors. Jolene Blalock played her character extremely well, as did Marnette Patterson as Holly Little. I also have to give the man who represented Johnny Rico's credit for contributing to this movie. I do not know how much they paid him, but hopefully enough to substantiate his time in playing in a very bad, very underdeveloped movie. The long and long list of cons: CONS: - The CGI. Since the first film was made in 1997, it was incredibly disappointing that the CGI was so bad. Given the advancement of computer graphics technology, you'd think a movie would at least try to live up to the 1997 standards. No - it did not. There is no need to think about it any more.- The acting. Most of the performance was filled with poor actors and actresses. Overemphasized, not emphasized, not emphasized at all - I found very few of the actors to be worth watching. I could not help but shrink from the way some of them played their characters, and the way several of them were portrayed. Military men and women do not follow what we, as individuals, think they will do, police officers and officers order troops around in insane and absurd patterns, and soldiers throw themselves over exploding insects when they could simply retreat to the back of the room . . Value is not even a problem here - its stupidity that charges the price. - The cheese. Yes, I specifically mentioned the cheese, even though it is highly relevant in this film. Sky Marshals as popstars, soldiers being informed that they will be shot if they ask for an autograph, and then try to ask for an autograph, federal high-ranking officers do not bother to draw a gun when they are being ruthlessly beaten, so they try to arrest a soldier by taking his burglar - there is little cheesy action for this movie, as there is no shortage of stupidity that comes with the cheese factor. All in all, I could not help it. imagine what exactly happened to this movie. STARSHIP TROOPERS 2 was a disappointment in itself, but three? ... it's horrible. It's better than 2, even though it follows the plot and building the world's first best, but it still does not make it a movie worthy of being seen. The STARSHIP TROOPERS franchise should have died after the first one was made. . MARAUDER must quickly die a slow and horrible death, if only because it stains the original to the point of disappointing it. I was excited to see this despite the warnings that several of my friends gave me. I definitely do not watch a room in this movie. If I start trying, I will remember how horrible two and three are, then push the first movie to the DVD player, even though the first one will always be the only good STARSHIP TROOPERS movie.""",0
"b""This movie could have been so much better, but they had to ruin everything, did not they? With the exception of very good performances by Denzel Washington, Ed O'Neill and Queen Latifah, the rest of the film simply falls flat. The plot seems so ridiculous that I can not help looking away. Angelina Jolie's performance is below average, but she did her best. The end of the turnaround was not too disappointing, but it fell because of its exaggerated (or lack of) suspense. I really do not like watching this thriller. There are better ones like Se7en and The Usual Suspects. Watch these two, and you'll see how a real thriller should be.Grade: D +""",0
"b""I loved this movie as a child, so I thought about buying the DVD. I saw a comment about the picture quality being prety bad, but I went ahead and bought anyway. I figured a slightly rough print would be better than a video tape used with image rot. I was not prepared for how wrong I could be. Basically, it looks like they hit this copy of a muffled 16mm projector print. Print has poor sprocket damage that causes the image to shake on the screen. It looks like they used the lamp from an easy oven to design this print. Calling the mud photo would be a compliment. All life and color were sucked out of this movie. I mentioned that the film was not even focused. The sound was really bad too, but I'm not much of an audiophile to actually talk about it. Do yourself a favor and look for the VHS version. It can not be worse than this copy. Or could it be? (I.e.""",0
"b'As a lifelong fan of this show, I was very disappointed to discover that Sony did not ""restore"" the film as alleged. The impression of the film used for the video transfer is scratched and filled with specs, fuzz, etc. As many other reviewers have noted, the soundrack is also nothing to write home about. In fact, you\'d better have an old version and VHS of the program, since the ""bonus"" features of this DVD release are insignificant (no ""making of"" features, interviews or anything like that). Certainly, a program of this beloved deserves a real restoration using the original source materials (if any) for film and soundtrack.'",0

"b'This is one of my favorite noirs movies, a great movie in which Welles showed the world that he could make a classic Hollywood movie without going over budget and still produce a genuine and personal masterpiece. I own two more previously released releases of this public domain movie, none of which did justice to the film. They look like worn VHS tapes. They are so bad. Finally, though with no extras and at a relatively high price, MGM has released what appears to be a transfer of an original 35mm print, if not the original negative. The image looks very clean and sharp with deep blacks and finally I can enjoy the movie as Welles intended. Buy .'",1
"b'Coleman Silk (Anthony Hopkins) is a highly respected faculty and professor. After an innocent comment is misconstrued as a racist comment, he is forced to leave his job in disgrace. Coleman begins a strange affair with a half-dead, unmarried woman (Nicole Kidman) who has had a tragic past and is not ready to reciprocate her love. To me, this weird little movie was doomed from the beginning, when the great finish is shown immediately. The rest of the story is shown in agitated and anticocyclical flashbacks (usually out of order), which did not allow any build-up of tension or sympathy for the main character, Coleman. As a young man from New Jersey, he is played by Wentworth Miller, who is quite charismatic and sympathetic, but he looked and looked nothing like the Welsh-accented adult Coleman (who sometimes appeared to channel a leper Hannibal Reader). Hopkins is so horribly miscast in this role that it is impossible to buy the racially charged plot. Kidman was also completely wrong for this movie; her innate grace and elegance could not be hidden by a messy hairstyle and I never bought her as an illiterate tutor. His graphic love scenes with Hopkins were more frightening than romantic. There is so much personal tragedy among the main characters - including Gary Sinise, who plays a troublesome writer and Ed Harris as a crazed Vietnam veteran - and the film fails completely and I did not feel connected with them or the whole premise of injustice. After that, I shook my head with this surprising movie clutter and was struck by the fact that so much talent could not save him.'",0
"b'& quot; Coffy & quot; (1973) made Pam Grier a star, & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; (1974) clearly shows why Grier became a star. & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; simply distills Grier\'s stellar qualities and uses them to their full potential, and by stellar qualities, I am not referring only to his broad body. In & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; Grier is a crazy abused and raped, wanting revenge at all costs, not only chews the scene, it destroys it. But that\'s exactly why we love Grier. She is beautiful, sensual and can kick an entire ass! As far as I\'m concerned, she\'s the original screen action heroine and this best vehicle shows her talents as an action star. Unlike & quot; Coffy, & quot; & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; does not give Grier much of a chance to flex his acting muscles, but presents Grier low and dirty: Foxy lives in apartments, beat lesbian hostiles, plucks eyes, burns alive men, weakens (literally and figuratively) his perfectly combed afro. & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; it\'s shocking, wildly sadistic, absolutely exaggerated, and a cult classic for the same reasons. & quot; Coffy & quot; may be the best movie, but & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; is more enjoyable. So, how come & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; rate on DVD? Well, the record is an absolute revelation. Not since the theatrical debut of the movie, it looked so good. The previous full-frame transfer used for the videotape and the CD was atrocious, featuring jaundiced skin tones, overly saturated colors, dark and dark interiors, ruined compositions, and horribly overrated edges. The new improved widescreen transfer anamorically is luminous. The compositions are preserved correctly with a ratio of 1.85: 1 ratio, with no more room for distraction and a little bit of image information is added to the sides. The interiors now reveal wood paneling, earthy wallpaper and brown curtains, unlike the previous transfer, which left almost everything black or dark brown. The skin tones are finally natural and the colors of the film are reduced to a level of comprehensible saturation, but do not worry, the 70\'s fashion is still a brilliant kaleidoscope of tawdriness. The sharpness is pleasant; The edge enhancement never raises its ugly head and the movie skies are finally blue. No more olive and yellow sunshine. The grain of film is noticeable in some dark scenes and there are some defects of origin. Considering that this is a low budget exploration film made in 1974, the source element is almost untouched. The compression on the disk is not so pure, though. Some dark and dark areas and dissolutions are often subject to artifacts side by side, but for a retail price of only $ 14.95, who can complain? The supplements include the entertaining theatrical trailer (""Foxy\'s got guts: without ifs, ands or buts!"") And an illuminating commentary by director Jack Hill that repeatedly describes the difficulties of working with AIP (American International Pictures) in this film, which he said was one of his worst experiences of making movies. The mono sound of the disc is recommended; the dialogue is always intelligible and the low level makes Willie Hutch\'s score sound as fun as it was 27 years ago. Jack Hill created Pam Grier his own subgenre with & quot; Coffy & quot; and & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; and when she left after 1976 it is bleak & quot; Friday Foster, & quot; no one took her place ... nobody ever got it. & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; is the best action vehicle Pam Grier, a classic blaxploitation and a great DVD! If you have only seen & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; on VCR or laserdisc, you did not see & quot; Foxy & quot; at all.'",1
"b'This movie is about a million times better than the recent remake ""Red Dragon"". The real conflict in the film is Will\'s tenuous understanding of his sanity as he accompanies a killer who is about to attack while dealing with a killer he has already caught. While Brian Cox\'s Lecktor will make comparisons with Anthony Hopkin\'s version in subsequent films, Cox interprets the psychopath as a real threat - a killer who will kill. Hopkins is brilliant too but I always felt that his Reader was like an animal that would attack only with a strong provocation. We see Cox and Petersen as equals on different sides of the fence, with little separation between them, apart from Peterson\'s knowledge of right and wrong. This thriller is one of the best.'",1
"b'I am a longtime follower of Smallville, and every year there are always fans (myself included) who point to the current year as ""Jumping the shark"". If you browse my profile, you\'ll find that my reviews of the older seasons get excited and become more critical as the years go by. While I\'m not going to comment on the current 8th screening season, the trend seems to be true when you compare Season 7 with the 6 that came before it - they are pure geniuses compared to this mess. There\'s a lot going on this year. Smallville always has great comic books, but lacks internal development and logic in his own world. Writers jump from plot to plot without any rhythm, so you get to seemingly dramatic life-changing events that are completely forgotten by the next episode. There is a shocking twist involving the new Daily Planet Editor, which was cut short when it became interesting; the return of Clark Lara\'s biological mother hardly lasts one episode; Bizzaro appears and is promptly defeated - twice; Clark travels through time and space to save his child in Krypton in five minutes. Sam Jones finally returns as Pete Ross and is wasted in the placement of horrible products. Supergirl is introduced and underdeveloped before being sealed with the clich\xc3\xa9 of amnesia and disappearing for most of the season. Why not settle on 2 or 3 stories and develop them properly? And I do not blame the writers\' strike, which cuts off this season in 2 episodes - the problems were obvious before the strike happened. Speaking of outside influences, some characters leave the show this year. The sudden departure of Kristen Kreuk to shoot Street Fighter leaves her weak character a pretty anemic farewell - luckily, she will return briefly in Season 8 to tie the loose ends. Another character that I will not ruin dies a noble death, and will be lost. It\'s Rosenbaum\'s departure that is the real kicker, though. Not only is the best actor in Smallville not coming back, but he continues with an ambiguous and unsatisfactory ending. Hardly a great success for 7 years of incredible work. There are some things Smallville does well this year - Brainiac\'s return and the \'Veritas\' plot bring a sense of continuity that the show has been extremely lacking. But overall, there is a lack of consistency that seasons 5 and 6 have tried to have, and the show does not have heart now that Kent\'s parents are gone. Whether or not you need this season depends on whether you bought the top six and want the complete collection.'",0

This movie is probably not the only one to look for when you're in the mood for something light and funny.

I really do not own it because I bought the complete collection of the Rambaldi box (all five seasons Alias \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bin one). But I saw the launch of the fifth season and it\'s terrible. Of all five DVD releases, it\'s the ugliest box. The promo photo is awful, the green cover does not go well with the other seasons, and the big words ""FINAL SEASON"" are simply cheesy. The box now is not sized for the other releases, it\'s what appears to be less than half an inch thick. This has been a big problem for me too, with Alias \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b- Buena Vista changing the packaging for each season. It is very annoying. Also, the special features are nothing. Some interesting features, but in general the supplements are very weak for the final season. The whole thing seems rushed and spoiled, as if no one had realized that this was the last season of such a beloved series. If you can afford it, I recommend you invest in the complete collection. It is very well made and assembled (although it has flaws) and has a bonus disc of extras that are very informative and fun to watch. However, only 40,000 are being made so supplies are limited.'",0

"b'""L\'Affaire du Collier"" may be based on a true story, but it is also a fascinating historical novel, ""The Necklace of the Queen"" by Alexandre Dumas, who certainly had more than the ""Three Musketeers"". on the sleeve Dumas tells the identical story of Joseph Balsamo (also known as Count Cagliostro), Jeanne de la Motte Valois, the lascivious but lovely Cardinal de Rohan and the great diamond blow, although the filmmakers do not credit Dumas (note that the book is available at Amazon.com, and I highly recommend it!) The costume designer, Malena Canonero, deserves applause for silks, satins, and lace jabots that magnificently recreate the opulence of Louis XVI\'s 18th-century court. The settings are also splendid. However, I found much of the strident music in which the composer insisted on giving him a modern beat sometimes and also used a mix of Mozart\'s ""Requiem"" among other things. I find these cuts and rearrangements of a bar here; a bar there, to be lazy and a little cheater. On the featurette, the director explained that he wanted to make the period ""accessible"" to the modern public. This ""accessibility"" not only insults the intelligence of modern audiences, but also weakens the film. As the story is so strong, I still enjoyed the movie. I was particularly impressed by the performances of Jonathan Pryce as the suave cardinal, Adrien Brody as Jeanne\'s irresponsible husband, and Simon Baker, who is especially engaging as his love interest. They are all believable and move well in their silks. Although Hilary Swank is an excellent actress, I thought she was wrong in that role. She seems a bit uncomfortable in her costume and moves more like a woman than the twenty-first century, instead of one of the eighteenth century. Leaving aside these reservations, I will keep this film and, no doubt, I will watch again.'",1

"b'I generally do not use the space provided for product reviews to comment on the condition of a particular piece of merchandise, or draw attention to a less reputable buyer. In this case, however, I shall make an exception. The DVD I received today, being sold by Amazon LLC, which is listed as `` Passport to Pimlico \'\' (Remastered Edition), is obviously a home-based job. The outer label is a color photocopy, the DVD itself is black and white, for God\'s sake. Flip the DVD and you can clearly see the band that the home recording makes on a recordable DVD. The manufacturer, A2ZCDs, seems to be a professional equipment, with a meaningful catalog, a good looking website, etc. But I do not know why this sale was not listed as coming from a third party vendor. (At least its coming from Amazon makes it easy to return.) But, more importantly, is not home-making DVDs simply, well, illegal? Does not this constitute piracy? My guess when I read the word ""remastered"" is that the print is made from an existing negative, or significantly cleaned; I certainly hope the studio, the filmmakers or at least the movie historians have some part in the album\'s production. Maybe whoever runs A2ZCDs has done some such work on household equipment, but that does not excuse the fact of fooling the general public. It may be that I have been away from the base and that the copyright to `` Passport to Pimlico \'\' has been running for years. Maybe no one owns the movie and we all have the right to photocopy it and sell it as the next guy. If so, my (saved) apologizes to the A2ZCDs. I think, however, that buyers should be aware that they are not getting merchandise that somehow reflect what most of us who collects movies have come to consider ""remastered"" or even professionally produced. I have a Panasonic DVD recorder and make my own movie DVDs that I recorded from TMC. In my craziest dreams, however, it would never occur to me to sell them. Maybe that makes me an idiot.

"b'Here\'s a riddle for all of you. What do you call ten gallons of ice cream and one scoop of dung? Ten gallons of manure. I do not care how much they wear the DVD version of this movie, it does not change the fact that it\'s terrible. I\'m just giving this star, but keep five or six Advil at hand. That should be enough to cover you for it. A couple of tips on this disaster: It\'s made by Uwe Boll, director of two of the WORST films I\'ve seen in \'House of the Dead\' and \'Alone in the Dark\'. In what was for me an impressive moment of brutal honesty, Boll himself admitted that he did not release the film until TWO WEEKS before the start of filming. What he ended up was a bunch of ""names"" who happened to have a hole in the agenda and appeared for a quick payment and a free trip to Romania. It also shows that the whole movie looks like they just skipped the essay and no one seems at all interested in making an honest effort. Will Sanderson and Michael Madsen may have discovered the only way to survive a Boll movie. They were completely intoxicated throughout the production. Ben Kingsley, who previously had to deal with Madsen in the movie ""Species"" refused to even be in the same set with him. In the harem scene with Meatloaf, these are HONEST TO GOD, 100% ROMAN PROSTITUTES WITH FULL-BLOODED. I swear you can not do these things. Apparently Boll could not play real actresses (his union fees made them very expensive), so he decided he could cut costs just by ordering for the real thing. This is a disaster from front to back. I\'ll give it, it\'s better than his last two movies. ""Bloodrayne"", at least, is a bit unintentionally funny. Even though I said that, I could never recommend anyone to see this. It will only encourage the man to continue. Uwe Boll, no doubt in my mind, is the most untalented filmmaker I\'ve ever seen. I\'m absolutely surprised this guy keeps finding his way behind a camera ...'",0

"b'I was eager to see this cinematic version of HG Wells\'s classic novel as the producers claimed it would remain true to the original location and period of the late Victorian Britain. Initially, I had been delayed buying this film since its original release in 2005 due to initial, and significant amount of complaints of low production values, weak FX, under par and ""endless walking scenes"". Needless to say, my passion for romance and courage took me the best and I had to see this movie by myself. Basically, I was aware of the short films and had no great expectations regarding the production, so I can honestly say that I liked the film despite the flaws that are too numerous to list here and have already been covered by much more eloquent reviewers that I. The editing of scenes and events would confuse a viewer who has not read the original novel and they soon lose the plot as the film alternates between scenes of the narrator in Woking and his brother in London. at one point, the brother is allegedly on a London street and suddenly witnesses the attack on the Elfinstone ladies on a lane inland and runs on their rescue. The red herb of Mars appears soon after the attack on Woking and Shepperton without any explanation within the film Much has been said about the meeting between HMS Thunderchild and the Martians, since the brother escapes from England in a ""paddestestearmer"", enough to say that it is really horrible and that it would be better to be left out altogether. There is a much-anticipated scene in which the legs of a tripod move toward an artillery battery that is probably the best effect inside that movie and shows what could have happened. There is a truly terrible dialogue between the characters. For example, I challenge someone not to regret it when they see the exchange between the ladies Elfinstone and the brother while they \'discuss\' how they are going to escape England. I would also award the James Doohan award for the worst Scottish accent witnessed in the movies since Brigadoon, when the narrator talks to a soldier at Horsell Common. In contrast, when you observe the interaction with the actors trapped in the ruined house, also the meeting of the narrator of the dead woman on a London street, you are sadly remembered again of what might have been. film 2 stars that is generous and for the following reasons.The score is fantastic.It is refreshing that the film is faithful to the events of the book and had made the effort, albeit ill, to set the book in Victorian England and yet another updated version definite In the USA. Regrettably due to cost constraints, British style buildings are scanned and fix the Monty Python style inside a field in Washington state to represent Woking, Shepperton or London. I liked the design of the combat machines, also of the manipulators in the pit scenes. my 17-year-old daughter who watched this movie was not impressed, but was intrigued by the setting and location of the films. As a result, she struggled to read the novel and, to my surprise, read from cover to cover. The irony is that H. Wells won another young admirer despite the very poor quality of this film and for that I am very grateful. However, would I recommend this movie to a friend? Unfortunately, not if I wanted them to be friends.'",0

It's a shame that what used to be a beautiful and memorable TV movie has become a worn and faded shadow of your old self. It is painful to see something occupying a special place in your heart be treated so meanly. For years, the only version that millions saw on TV had colors so faded and low contrast that it almost seemed to have been filmed in black and white! If this is what you are accustomed to, & quot; restored & quot; The version of this DVD (and the one shown on TV in the last 3 or 4 years) looks a bit better, but it is hardly restored. Just look at a deleted music in the extras section to see how the original production was beautiful and bright: crisp, clear, immaculate, with highly saturated colors. Time and money must have been spent to bring the rest of the film to that standard. It is morally wrong to put a defective product on the market, so have the courage to charge money for it. As many of our parents probably told us when we were young, & quot; It pays to do anything worthwhile! & quot;""",0
"b'COME THE FIRST MORNING You\'ve seen a movie and then thought to yourself that ""the man is real,"" but not as a documentary, but just a piece of cinema that seems to have been ripped out of real life. If you\'ve ever felt that way then chances are you\'re watching this one. ""Come Early Morning"" is a wonderful little film made wonderfully by Joey Lauren Adams of Chasing Amy\'s fame and starring Ashley Judd and Jeffrey Donovan. This honestly looks like cameras were set up throughout the city and this is what was captured, it seems real. The film follows Lucy Fowler (Judd) on her journey through her thirties waking up every morning beside a useless guy after another. She is also dealing with a father with whom she is desperately trying to pass the time, although it seems that he could care less. So the story goes that she is a desperate and confused woman who is just looking for love and acceptance. Of course you could say that your problems with men emanate from your distant relationship with your father. Still, she ends up meeting at least one decent guy named Cal Percell (played so well by Donovan), who seems to want a relationship with her, despite her problem. It is this relationship here that is the driving force of the film, although the time spent with the father and roommate also adds an interesting dynamic. The great thing about all this is how it all ends. Director / Director Adams proves that all this time spent with Kevin Smith was worth it because this is a wonderful debut film. His direction is great, but it\'s his writing that really makes this movie so good. Like I said, this has to be one of the most real movies I\'ve seen in a while. I like the fact that she has not romanticized the main character and her problems, things do not end the way you want them to. This movie has an ending that is probably what would really happen, how big is that? Even those who did not grow up in a small town can relate to the things that are happening in this movie. Of course, Judd Judd is brilliant as the thirty-something girl who is trying to find her way. And you know Jeffery Donovan is great as the guy who should have been the one for her. Laura Prepon from ""That 70\'s Show"" is as good as Judd\'s roommate and best friend, she even finds love. Also Scott Wilson is brilliant as she finds father religion that looks as off her as she. In fact, the whole cast is great and deserves all the credit in the world. In addition to that the film was also filmed very well and for such a limited budget, it seems that the movie showed the whole city, even if it did not happen. I would have to say that this is one of the best movies that came out in a time and a wonderful debut for a filmmaker. For those who look like this, I say spread the word and review it now. And for those who have yet to see, I recommend this as a purchase, but I think you can try a rental. This is a wonderful movie with a great cast with real issues that everyone should be able to relate to. I would love to go on this movie, but anything can come is to watch it, if it\'s not your thing that\'s fine, but for those who enjoy these types of movies you will like this a lot.'",1

"b""as a lennon fan, I was extremely reluctant at first to see this movie. However, after some comments from Beatles my friends who had seen the movie, I decided to rent it and was impressed by how brilliant the movie was. Everything from the cast to the director was top notch. I really enjoyed Jonas Ball as well as the sheer amount of awesome supporting actors who lent their talents to the screen. For me, personally, besides Jonas, which is fantastic, I discovered that the psychologist and the taxi driver are also extremely talented. After all, I thought John Lennon's murder was an extraterrestrial film and I highly recommend it.""",1
"b""Everything was covered by other reviewers, but I wanted to ask if CBS would like to add the option of running ALL episodes with the bumpers intact.

It would be awesome to have those included in each episode. That's all I have to say except please bring the season more often.""",1
"b""Down right pathetic. It 's safe to say that this is and I'm going to mark it as Stephen Dorff (Cecil B. Demented, Blade, Entropy) and the worst Christian Slater movie (Pump Up The Volume, True Romance, Heathers) they've ever done. Slater is a paranormal expert who for 22 years was part of a laboratory experiment in which he was tested on children in an orphanage. Slater hunts artifacts from a lost civilization ... he was once part of an elite government group that traces a type of creature that attacks in the dark and hates the light and no, I'm not talking about vampires ... put it clearly, they look like the mutant children of Godzilla. Slater joins ex-pitcher / archaeologist Tara Reid (Van Wilder, Urban Legend, Cruel Intentions) and his old friend, who used to work in the elite government group ... presented by Dorff. Everyone threw away the movie we suffered from major pounding headaches while watching a badly scripted and ill-directed movie with twists and turns where we know who is going to die and live. Directed by the director of House Of The Dead, Uwe Boll, and I can say that this movie is Bolls ** t. He can not drive crap. What a waste of actors and what a waste of time. Avoid this toxic waste. Well, if you want to suffer from action scenes with heavy metal scores and a tacky love scene with Reid and Slater with the cheesiest song ... this is your ticket.""",0

"b'The Banks family needs a new nanny for Jane and Michael. Fortunately, it comes to the wind in the form of Mary Poppins. She is everything kids want, fun and magical. But while she takes them to paint the fields and tea parties on the ceiling, their father is less happy. Can it be made to see beyond the end of the nose? Ok, so this movie is really little more than an excuse for music and dance numbers. Still great! The plot is thin paper, and you miss his site in the midst of some of his fantastic scenes. Of course, part of this is because the film is based on a book that is nothing more than short stories. Still, this movie is more fun than anything else. And it has that in spades. What kid does not have fun imagining that they can do all the things that Jane and Michael do in this movie? They say that Walt Disney poured everything he learned to make this movie, and it shows. Many of the special effects remain remarkably well today. There were some that I had not even discovered until I attended this special edition. And the music! Any Disney fan knows these songs by heart. And you can not stop humming ""A Spoonful of Sugar,"" ""Jolly Holiday,"" ""Let\'s Go to Kite,"" or ""Chim Chim Cher-ee"" for days after seeing it. Those who want to own a great DVD of this movie will not be disappointed with this two-disc set. Disc one presents the film in all its glory on wide screen. I can not see how that\'s better. The soundtrack has many different options, but the home theater mix will amaze you. It\'s fantastic . There is also a commentary track with Julie Andrews, Dick van Dyke, Karen Dubice (Jane) and Richard Sherman. Sprinkled are comments from other archives, including Disney himself. Also included are some pop-up facts to read along with while watching the movie. Disc two features a new documentary about the film, a deleted song, and more about music with Julie, Dick and the composers. And be sure to check out the animated cartoon ""The Cat That Looked Like a King,"" a tale adapted from one of the later books in the series. One thing that comes out loud in this setting is how much everyone had fun doing and how much they respect Walt Disney. The fact that this film lasted 40 years is a testament to its genius. With this set, it will be appreciated by generations to come.'",1
"b""I would not go as far as the previous reviewer in saying it's some kind of liberal conspiracy movie (and if it is, I hate listening to what people say about movies like Ferngully and Once Upon A Forest). I doubt that the fact that most humans care little about our impact on the environment is news to anyone, nor the fact that some of us kill other living creatures for a mirad of reasons ranging from fun to need real. That said, however, I can not give this movie a better rating. CG animation is * much * lower quality than the cover makes it look (more in line with a Saturday morning cartoon than a real feature film). I do not think I found a single funny joke in the whole movie, and more than a few scenes were so rude that I preferred to look away rather than watch them. The image is often dark and disturbing (the woman trying to behead a cat with a chainsaw comes to mind), and the peaceful outdoor scenes seem very fake. The animation has several parts that are remarkably poor when compared to a good CG movie (or even decent). In addition, humans are distorted almost beyond recognition. In short, there are many good CG titles, but that's certainly not one of them.""",0

Playing & quot; Savage General & quot; Peck's role is that of an incoming commander with rigid military discipline beliefs to get the most out of his men and bring in what they lacked with their previous commander. The script itself is fun with philosophies and non-stop suspense. I would recommend this movie very strongly as a training video for people in professions where leadership is the key to success. Notice carefully how General Savage incorporates strict temperance discipline into his interactions with his men. With the gain of respect, he also gained the confidence of the troops. This form of leadership is almost non-existent today. However, it is literally, & quot; proven combat & quot; .""",1

"b'This film begins with a simple question from Richard Lobb of the National Chicken Council: ""In a way, we are not producing chickens, we are producing food. What this does is produce lots of food in a small amount of space at a very affordable price. Let someone explain to me what\'s wrong with that. ""Well, this movie explains very well what\'s wrong with that. The first point is that it\'s not good to treat animals as if they were mere objects."" You will see chickens and knee-high meat in their own excrement. You will also see chickens in their cages, not being able to carry their own weight. The animals are kept all the time in the dark, inclusive for us. It was very difficult for the filmmakers to get some footage from inside these chicken coops. The second point, connected in a way to the preceding one, is that our food can be easily contaminated with E-coli due to the excrement of the animals. continue your skin. This is how food poisoning can occur in the slaughterhouse. Barbara Kowalcyk, mother of a 2.5-year-old child, has experienced the most horrible experience anyone can suffer: the death of their child ... The reason: eating a hamburger ... ... `` We put faith in our government to be protected, but we are not being protected at the most basic level, \'\' she says. This is not an inconvenient truth - although this film was produced by the same company that brought us the documentary with the same title. This is an ugly truth. Can we do something about it? Absolutely. ""You can change the world with every bite."" Switch to organic. Better yet it would connect again with the source of your food, what you are eating, what you are putting in your mouth! The best thing to do would be to get involved with a local farmer that you know and can trust.'",1
"b""The release of Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbound by Criterion has a small flaw. 74 minutes in the film, we have a picture of J.B. (Gregory Peck) holding a razor blade while listening to Brulov's screen (Michael Checkov): 'Is that you, Mr. Brown? 'We then cut to Brulov for the next line' Oh, I thought it was you. Simple, is not it? Well, the Criterion DVD cuts the blade very early, and then has the footage of Brulov singing his second line while overdubbing his! st Then we take the second line correctly. In other words, the filming of Brulov's line 'Oh, I thought it was you' is united twice! ! So far I do not know if the Criterion disk is the only version affected. If you do not mind the flaw, then the Spellbound version of Criterion is the version to be collected (great extras and image quality). And if you can still find it somewhere (since it 's now sold out) do not hesitate to buy it, it' s still a very good album and these extras really make this DVD a true collector 's item.

"b""I love the Murder She Write Series and I really hoped the show was released on DVD. I have the 1st and 2nd season. I love watching episodes, but I'm very disappointed in the quality of the DVDs themselves. I understand that this is not happening with all DVDs, but many of the sets (including mine) have DVDs that skip and stop. I have to skip entire chapters of the shows just to get to the next episode. The problem is to use both sides of the DVD to store the episodes. If any research had been done on two-sided DVDs before putting this wonderful show into the cheaper two-sided format then we would not have as many sets of DVDs jumping. I really wish they had gone to the best quality route and not the cheapest route.""",0
"b""The Sons of Paradise, by Marcel Carne, succeed on so many levels that deservedly deserve to be called one of the greatest films of all time. Carne filmed the film gradually during the Nazi occupation of Paris. His film was officially supported despite the occupation, since the Nazis wanted to show that they were friends of the arts. This created the ironic situation in which Carne was receiving money from the government to support a film during the day and to tap aid to the French resistance at night. An actor was supposed to be a Nazi collaborator. He disappeared mysteriously during filming and had to be replaced. Despite all these obstacles, Carnival managed to recreate the Paris of the nineteenth century magnificently. In this way, the film itself is a triumph of the creative spirit. The title refers to the poor, who could only afford seats so high in the theater that they were almost on the rafters ... and yet these were the actual audiences. the actors performed for. The story is a series of cross-lives that, one way or another, revolve around the world's bohemian and tired Garance (played in the Mona Lisa style by Arletty). In addition, the film also revolves around the theatrical life of 1840 in Paris: the actors, the audience and all others. Garance is almost a courtesan: she moves conveniently between four men who love her, apparently unaffected by any of them ... in the end, she falls in love with the mimic Baptiste (Jean-Louis Barrault) ... but Baptiste is married to another woman after losing her chance with Garance years before. Are they going to be together? In the end, we, the viewers, are either the Sons of the Gods, or Sons of Paradise, that the title refers to the theatrical audiences of the film. In fact, opening and closing credits are played against a theater curtain. We are the spectators in the Gods, and the actors are presenting themselves to us living their lives: loving, living, dying ... feeling pain and joy. The Carne movie lasts more than three hours, but it's never late. The stories intersect and can not be adequately described in a simple review like this ... Four men love Garance and, in a way, all their lives intersect in and around the theater. The cinematography is incredible. There's a crowd scene at the end of the movie that resists anything ever filmed: it's simply magnificent. Batista is lost (in many ways) in a burgeoning mass of movement of mankind. Only this scene is reason enough to see the movie. I suspect this is a movie that people love or hate. The long duration can drive away many people, but this is a shame. The movie is not for those who want instant gratification. Instead, it is something to be enjoyed and enjoyed. If all this makes it look very serious, make sure it is not. Children of Paradise is a tragedy in some respects, but it is also a comedy in the Shakespearean sense. This was a movie made for a company like Criterion, and they do it justice in their DVD edition. The two halves of the film are presented on individual discs, so the film never experiences compression failures or other problems. The restoration is perfect: you would never know that this movie is almost sixty years old. The audio is mono, but very clean, no hiss or static. Criterion also included some supplements, inverviews, filmographies, trailers, etc., but the real treat is the movie itself. It is timeless.""",1
"b'I want to start by saying that this is the best Blu-Ray version I\'ve bought so far. The packaging is marvelous with its hard-shell ""souvenir"" aesthetic, and additional bonus features make it worth the meager asking price. Watching real scenes from Linda Blair (not less complete) on the set is invaluable and definitely outweighs any extras from previous releases. Regarding the important things .... THE MOVIE. I have to say that this has become my favorite movie of all the times. I am by no means a terror fan. I have some favorites of the genre ... but I opt more for the comic and / or fantastic. I like being raised with laughter, or drawn from reality completely. You ask, ""So why on Earth would you consider the Exorcist your favorite movie? ? \'\'. It\'s a modern parable and it\'s one of those rare films that really produces the intended effect in every frame. Labeling ""The Exorcist"" as a horror movie is a bit myopic. It\'s a spiritual drama, a psychological thriller and a supernatural tale ... all together. A billion years later, it still retains its own and is as relevant today as it was then. The difference here is that we now live in a society that is, as Blatty states in the documentary ""Fear Of God"" ""totally tired and depraved."" Nothing here seems to shock and 14-year-olds now see this movie as ""laughable."" It\'s a shame, because there\'s so much more than pea soup and spinning heads here. It\'s really all about the terror of the unknown ... the fear and trepidation involved in all things metaphysical and spiritual. It is about the mystery of faith and your ability to succeed. Visions, sounds and history ... everything merges here. It\'s incredibly well written by Blatty. Friedkin\'s sense of documentary realism serves the plot well. The acting is top notch by a cast that could not have been more perfect. Dick Smith\'s makeup is groundbreaking, not only with Linda Blair, but with Max Von Sydow, who was in his mid-forties. Owen Roizman\'s use of varied light textures and, of course, his magisterial and iconic photo of Merrin\'s arrival is also noteworthy. I was fortunate enough to see the Fathom screening on Sept. 30 and while watching this movie a large screen with digital sound was fantastic, I still have to say that it plays better and provides more enervating sensations when watching at home ... in the dark. This is the truly scary angle within this movie ... it reminds us that no matter how safe we \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bthink we are (even in our own house with all the lights on), there is nothing that the real evil does not do nowhere do not go to manifest.'",1
"b""Let me start by saying that I love & quot; Oh My Goddess & quot; and I was really looking forward to the DVD release of the series.

That being said, I am shocked and disappointed to discover that they have split the series into two DVDs, each for separate sale. The episodes are very short, totaling just over an hour per DVD (I believe it's 82 minutes for Vol. 1 and 62 minutes for Vol. 2). No extra features included. Yikes! This is a lot for two and a half hours of viewing. I find it hard to believe that Animego could not do more justice to this excellent series, or provide more value to its customers. The six parts & quot; Moldiver & quot; OAV has managed to find a way to a DVD with good prices. How disappointing that & quot; Oh My Goddess & quot; could not do the same. I am sad to say that this is a great series for renting (but not for buying).""",0
"b'Ripe is not an Lolita sex exploit film as supersaturated key art may suggest. Instead, it is a challenging and unusual exploration of feminine sexuality and maturity, with imagery directed and well represented by its three protagonists. The script sometimes becomes rocky and coarse as in many indie films (too many curses are a curse on independent scripts). , but the film is visually stunning, and the accumulation of little moments is delightful - when Violet discovers the adult magazines, for example, or when the stern man carrying the sisters has to explain the menstruation to her. And the final scene with the two sisters is devastating, a strange amalgam of suspense, family drama, and psychosocial implications. A wonderful soundtrack by Anton Sanko (ex-Suzanne Vega Band) extends this aesthetically excellent film, curiously moving and ultimately very somber. .'",1
"b""The Iron Giant is a loose adaptation of a wonderful book of the same title, by Ted Hughes (written in the late sixties). In the book, the giant's origins are unknown, and he is initially buried under the ground before being attacked and finally being helped. The enemy in the book, who becomes a common enemy for both the humans and the giant and the cause of his alliance, was a gigantic dragon-like creature (as big as Australia !!) that the giant ends up overtaking. , set during the Cold War, and featuring a wonderful picture of the 1950s atmosphere, the enemy is the American - and our tendency to fear what is strange, and shoot first and ask questions later. I think this is, in the end, deeper. Of course the original author may have had some such allegory in mind when he wrote the original book, as the dragon from outer space ends up destroying and enveloping a large part of the planet in the darkness, almost like a world war. But in this case does his alliance with the giant supposedly signify an alliance with military technology to prevent a world war? In the movie, the robot is just a cool robot from outer space, that humans can choose to make a friend or establish as an enemy. Either way, this is easily one of the best animated films coming out of the UK. States in the last decade (and one of the others is from the same director, Brad Bird).""",1
"b""I can not remember the last time I was so entertained by a movie I watched three times in 24 hours. STILL CRAZY took me out of my somber, somewhat starched middle-aged existence and carried me back to my college years in the seventies when I was in a disorganized part-time band. Make no mistake: this film unites the chaotic, weird, self-absorbed, arrogant and irresistibly dysfunctional behavior of rock musicians. The characters' antics - even in middle age, as they try to revive their careers - have brought back a multitude of memories. I can also remember shows that went awry; band members screaming chords with each other during a song; the frequent & quot; artistic & quot; disagreements; improvised improvisation sessions in barns, garages, empty high school bandrooms; and the thrill of connecting with an audience (usually a drunken audience). Buy this movie ... rent this movie ... watch this movie. It is more than just a comedy; there is a very real human component that transcends even the tumultuous world of the music industry. You will laugh, you will brush an occasional tear, and you will be completely entertained. The flame still burns. God bless rock 'n roll!""",1

This movie ended as a horror movie. It is a terrible example for any black woman who may be watching. This kind of aggressive and sadistic behavior is what you can read in the news, not in a romantic comedy or drama, or whatever that melodrama should be. I hope black women do not watch this movie and think the ending of the movie was good because it was quite sinister. Black men also seem unusually weak, while black women seem dominant. No man really wants a dominant woman with a loud mouth, no matter what Tyler Perry says. This movie gave me nightmares.'",0

I finally upgraded to DVD and was completely disappointed. This ALICE DVD is a clipped and censored version of the movie. Ten to fifteen second pieces were lifted here and there, leaving chopping heels in their places. And near the end of the movie, a whole scene was eliminated. Cropped images are all scenes containing full frontal nudity and / or the most brutal violence. The cuts are obvious - no attempt was made to make them flow with the movie ... the music and voice narration clipped awkwardly with each trimming instance The information about the runtime in the box is wrong ... in the box, the original ALICE runtime is listed: 62 minutes. But the DVD version only runs 53 minutes with all cuts. I've been a fan of Something Weird for years ... But now I'm disappointed with the company. They used to be a haven for unfiltered, non-PC, full-in-rave, horror, psychedelic exploration and simply a weird cinema ... things the masses would not want.

"b'Simplifying: Style over substance. There are some excellent sequences, but that\'s all this movie looks like, well planned and executed sequences - but without anything coherent, sticking it all together. The \'near-impact plane and the last-minute rescue\' is extremely impressive and the machine-gun ammunition crashing into Supe\'s chest, followed by the bullet in the eye, is magnificent. My chin was falling and I almost wanted to cheer. That\'s what Superman is about: seeing him defeat the bad guys in new, interesting ways - even fun. But that\'s when the fun ended. As Superman is not, it\'s children\'s love and ridiculous heroic jokes with kryptonite. I think both are so horribly implausible that both should be ridiculed. Like Brodie (skillfully played by Jason Lee in Kevin Smith\'s Mallrats), ""It\'s impossible! Lois Lane could never have Superman\'s baby. Do you think your fallopian tubes could handle your sperm? I assure you that when he comes during sex, he probably blows a load like a shotgun blast ... across her back. ""So, besides Lois Lane being alive after intercourse, you would have the impossibility of a human being conceiving and bringing the term of an alien\'s son to the term. Do not forget that just because Clark Kent looks and ostensibly acts like a human, he is an alien. He is a different species entirely. And totally different species can not mate. Just think of the chaos that would ensue in the animal kingdom if a lion falls in love and mates with a crocodile. Or a graffiti. The other issue that makes me shake with rage is the whole crappy concept of Superman being physically able to lift an entire continent of kryptonite into outer space. As the internet blogger dpogue21 speaks so proficiently (much better than I do - so thank you dpogue) in his review of imdb, ""my next big complaint is that Superman raises a continent made of kryptonite into outer space. He does not get the Simpsons comic book guy to point out what\'s wrong with that. I do not know how many comic books Bryan Singer has read, but when Superman is exposed to a small amount of kryptonite he barely has the strength to stand. Whoever has had the idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bmaking him fly on a big island, made up of his greatest weakness in space, has no business being associated with any other Superman-related project. The concept is as ridiculous as making a Dracula movie, where the title character has a stake in his heart and still manages to pilot a spaceship made out of garlic in the sun. Why does not only Superman eat kryptonite? He can eat it and then brush his teeth with it and then sleep in kryptonite pajamas. This is no more absurd than having him hoisting a continent of kryptonite into space and then falling helplessly through the atmosphere without burning into re-entry or spreading throughout the central park when it hits the ground. \'\' Do I need to say more? I do not think so. ** [...]'",0
"b'I was surprised that the editorial reviews of this movie treat as just another movie, which it definitely is not. I would describe this in several ways: like the movie that John Waters would give his left hand to do; like a tremendous drama of dramatic, intense and tear-drenched dance films, such as Red Shoes, which takes the hat from the concept of ""field"" without throwing the whole experience away just to maintain consistency with attitude; like a comedy that, if you understand the joke, will make you foolish to laugh sometimes. There are times when I was not sure which movie I was in, as the plot listed towards Flashdance and then Cinderella. But that\'s the kind of movie it is; embraces the operatic emotion and the high melodrama and, although it recognizes the common one, never becomes this way. And it beautifully communicates the essential madness of all inclusive and integrated subcultures. (The constant exhortations of the old guard so that the hero does not indulge in ""movements pleasing to the crowd"" are hilariously absurd and at the same time totally typical of such subcultures, where the most sensible question is always ""Who on earth made these above these rules! ``) It\'s a strange and intense movie, which contantly you unbalance, and wondering whether to take it seriously or as an elaborate type of dream comedy filmed (think of Rocky Horror Show photo). is that you never have to decide, you can enjoy new aspects in several views.'",1
"b""Ridley Scott's alien must be considered one of the best thrillers ever placed on celluloid. He is at the top with films like Hitchcock's Psycho and Tod Browning's Dracula (1931). Alien is basically a haunted classic movie, but instead of an old and scary Victorian mansion, we have a dirty old space freighter and the endless darkness of space. The stranger rises above his credentials in movie B - - this movie is actually a B movie in the heart - with a very tense and clever script, and exceptional direction by Ridley Scott. From the long opening sequence of the Nostromo filling the screen, audiences know they will be treated to an exceptionally filmed film. Ridley Scott has always been known for his art direction and the biomechanical appearance of the scenarios in Alien helps to heighten the sense of dread and horror. This helps that Scott and his team decided to hire the famous Swiss surrealist H.R. Giger to project the appearance of sets and creatures. Anyone who has seen Giger's work can easily see his influence on the scenario for the Alien. Giger's final design for the main creature will be one of the best creations in movie history. So far, everyone knows what to imagine when someone mentions the words Alien and films together. The group of actors chosen for the film is excellent from top to bottom. Tom Skerritt's Capt. Dallas is a solid base upon which the rest of the characters revolve around. The slow descent of Veronica Cartwright's character to hysteria - fully suited to the situation with which she and the rest of her teammates are confronted - is like a barometer for the growing fear that permeates the entire film from beginning to end. . The highlight of the cast has to be Sigourney Weaver. The fact that this was her first major role in the movies bodes well for what the public could expect of her as her career exploded. His character of Lieutenant Ellen Ripley is practically the antithesis of Cartwright's Lambert. Where Lambert slowly descended into a paralyzing hysteria, Ripley slowly took control of the situation and became the de facto leader after Dallas. The overall tone of the film owes much to the past scifi horror / thrillers. But instead of constant scares and red handcuffs, Scott slowly increased the tension and feared with long, slow strokes of empty hallways and cargo holds. For a movie that is considered one of the best horror movies ever made, Alien does not have many dark areas where the monster suddenly jumps. The monster will jump from well-lit and spacious areas. Scott also used Spielberg's trick to prevent the monster creature from appearing on the screen for just a few quick glimpses. It's not until near the end that we see the Alien creature of Giger in all its glory. This newest of the many editions of Alien DVD has finally come with re-edited scenes that add more shock and horror to the film. I have to agree with Scott's reasoning to exclude themsevles scenes. It slows down the roller coaster, accelerating pace in the latter part of the film. But in the comfort of the home theater itself, these re-edited scenes are easier to understand. The original director's and director's movie look has been remastered and looks great, especially when viewed on a progressive scan DVD player and a dedicated widescreen HDTV. Sound and music also received a 4-star remastering treatment to make better use of home theater systems that are growing in number. The alien is the most superior entry in the Foreign Quadrilogy, although Aliens is a more exciting film. Alien takes the horror scifi genre and sets a standard that many still need to achieve today.""",1

"b'The latest assault committed by a professional thief and his team goes terribly wrong, and the clean plan organizer gets more than he expected. Agents and mobsters chase after him, but he keeps his cool under pressure, thwarts the other party\'s plans, and can always get rid of the mud. This is a standard story format for the action movie. It looks clich\xc3\xa9. d predictable, but works well with good pace in action and the director\'s safe guidance. But `` 7 Seconds \'\' does not have them. Wesley Snipes plays the thief named Jack. Jack\'s unsuccessful robbery in Bucharest, Romania, leads to a new problem because his girlfriend / partner in the crime is abducted during the shootings. He holds a hostage by a NATO military police officer (Tamzin Outhwaite after his British accent) after the chaos (and saving her life too), and engages in the pursuit of urban cars with family scenarios. The story does not make much sense (why steal money from casinos in Romania?), But the earlier part of ""7 Seconds"" is fun with decent stunts on cars and a bit of humor. The actions are confusing, and you do not know where those cars are going, but at least the acrobatics themselves are not bad. Then in the middle part of the movie, boredom sets in, which interrupts the actions and begins to introduce superfluous characters, as well as an unnecessary plot or twist. We do not need to see Wesley Snipes walking in the station and putting a briefcase in the coin cabinet there. Or, in fact, we do not care what the folder actually contains; and we do not even want to know if anything in it (whatever it is) is real or not. We want excitement and action, or funny dialogues. Except for a few brief martial arts acrobatics and slightly amusing jokes between Snipes and Outhwaite, ""7 Seconds"" does not have much to show, particularly in its second part where the movie has another stunt sequence involving street cars but is hampered by unstable editing. We often hear complaints or criticisms about direct films, but in fact some of them are very good, offering 90 minutes like the films of Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren. Unfortunately, despite all the good acting of the stars, ""7 Seconds"" by Wesley Snipes is not one of them.'",0

"b'The Crucible, based on Arthur Miller\'s play, is a fun, though not always accurate, version of the 1692 events in Salem Village. Having read numerous books on the subject, I still can not say with certainty what led to the events that so many men and women were accused of witchcraft and so many young girls seemed to be afflicted. It may be questioned why it was only the Salem females, and not the males that seemed afflicted with shouting, catatonic states, hallucinations, etc ... Anyway, one conclusion I could not draw was that of a despised woman in this Case Abigail Williams played for Winona Ryder whose advances are declined by the married John Proctor (Daniel Day Lewis). The Proctors are also much younger in the film than in real life. John was sixty when he was hanged. Elizabeth would be in her forties at the time of the trials. Pregnancy saved her from hangman\'s tie. The film retains a good deal of precision in the treatment of the Tituba slave and her part anyway, as well as the accusations against some of the ""trouble-makers"" cities such as Good Nurse and Giles Corey who was pressed to death for refusing to witness. The courtroom scenes were the most dynamic and exciting, and brought to the attention those period paintings from old books, depicting trials with stern and puritan judges pointing to accusing fingers. The film also did a good job capturing that stifling and repressive scenario of the seventeenth century and the costumes were first-rate. The best performances for me came from those men who played the various ministers and judges, particularly Bruce Davison as Reverend Parris and Paul Scofield as Judge. Danforth. Although not a totally accurate film, it still does a good job of capturing one of the seminal events in American history. Reviewed by Tim Janson'",1

"b'This movie starts quickly and quickly immerses the viewer into a very strange world, with dialogue and action that accelerates, hindering the accompaniment. The important thing is to stay there and the pieces will start to fit together. The film is based on a novel by Philip K. Dick, who is known for his highly original imagination and who came up with ideas for stories unlike any other person. This is one more of those original stories and takes the viewer to a wild ride. Fortunately, the pieces begin to fit together and do so with the dramatic use of the surround speakers and plenty of onscreen action. The basic premise of the film is a technology developed that allows the visualization of a crime before it actually happens so that the police can intervene and stop the crime before it occurs. Just as this crime prevention system is ready to happen all over the country, something happens and changes everything. The character of Tom Cruise, a police officer named John Anderton, is suddenly plunged into a situation that threatens his own life. He must now use the crime prevention system called Precrime to discover the truth and find out who is out to frame it. His quest for truth provides the basis for this exciting action movie. I encourage the viewer to give the film a chance because, although it may seem confusing at first, it quickly turns into a good science fiction movie.'",1
"b'Some people in Germany have accused this film of trying to ""make harmless"" the crimes of the Third Reich. This could not be further from the truth, and I will explain why. Bruno Ganz plays Hitler as the man. Hitler, the man who loves his dog, who is cool to his secretary, who loves his friends and spits on the people he thinks betray him, who tells those he cares about saving himself as he prepares to take cyanide, if kill and then be burned. This is a guy who, as long as he is not talking about the Jews or the domination of the world, would not be so difficult to live with. WHO, this is still Hitler\'s monster. Being vegetarian does not exempt you from being directly responsible for the deaths of millions or for launching the whole world into war. Hitler, the two-dimensional monster, is inseparable from Hitler, the three-dimensional man, and that\'s what this movie reminds us every time it makes you feel sorry for him, even though he knows, and the movie recalls, that he was a monster. All the monsters in history - past, present and future - have been and are and will be human beings. We liked to imagine Hitler as a kind of inhuman monster, but he was only human. Very human. That\'s why this movie makes people uncomfortable; it reminds them that any leader of men who looks like a good companion can become a monster if the right questions are never asked or if ideas are never questioned. The warning is uncomfortable: you can not trust any ideologue about face value. Not one single, ever. And / or / is the real import of this movie, if `` Never Again \'\' is to have some kind of real. that is, next to a slogan. If I were a history teacher, I would show this film followed by Schindler \'s / List. Both are equally true and equally important sides of history: all this horror is of simple human beings born.'",1
"b'I absolutely love this DVD! Along with a healthy daily diet of 1200 calories, I have been practicing this DVD every night since May 22, 2007 and to this day I have lost over 30 pounds and 12 inches from my waistline. I started with ease and worked my way to following Suzanne during the session. My back has never felt stronger and is ultimately gratifying looking forward to doing a relaxing but rewarding workout every night. However, I would like to know what kind of Yoga Suzanne is practicing so that I can add some more difficult poses to my routine. I would also like to know, since I am counting calories, approximately how many calories are burned during this 45 minute routine? I would love to know, too, if Suzanne has a Power Yoga DVD.

"b'I was and still am a faithful fan of Xena and Gabrielle. Let me remind those who liked the end of something. Real life is full of sadness, misery, loss and tragedy. We watch TV and movies to escape reality. Xena was a tragic figure early in her life. She killed for little or no reason. But she saw that she was wrong. She changed her ways and fought for justice. There is no way to bring the dead back to life. But Xena repented and dedicated her life to fighting for good. She risked her life many times to save the lives of countless others. (Let the sinless cast the first stone) We need a heroine like Xena. We want to see that ""white hats"" win and the bad ones of ""black hats"" lose. I know that reality does not work that many times. But Xena was different. She is special. I think it\'s more difficult, very tragic and pathetic that Xena has to die. And if dying was not enough, decapitating it made my stomach turn. I own the whole series. But I will never, ever watch the last episode again. I gave it two stars because Xena\'s tragic and unnecessary death puts a stain on the entire series.'",0

The biggest difference between the movie and the video game is the reset button. I kept looking for one at the theater. You'd expect a second-class performance from Tara Reid, but not from Christian Slater or Stephen Dorff.

"b""From the myriad interpretations of this game I've seen on stage and screen, this is the best - a strong statement, considering the many excellent actors who have been drawn to powerful characters from Tennessee Williams (eg, Katherine Hepburn and Sam Waterston). John Malkovich seems to have been born to play Tom, the artist divided between family duties and desire to travel. The intense and percussive style of Malkovich is an ideal combination for the play of Williams, in which the text and its poetry dominate. His performance in this role is the most convincing of all I have ever seen, and he avoids the trap of allowing Tom to become too grumpy and selfish. Joanne Woodward is also perfect as Amanda, who, though deluded, narrow and even moronic, keeps her family together for her unique blend of courage and despair. Karen Allen and James Naughton also capture what I think Williams must have intended in the characters Laura Wingfield and the caller sirs, and the two generate real chemistry in the crucial scene with the glass unicorn. This is a must see for anyone interested in American theater.""",1
"b""The wooden box is a bit mushy, but it is the most important thing, and what is inside this wooden box is indispensable for all serious Morse fans.

Colin Dexter's stories are well written, and the characters fit the screen well thanks to the excellent performance of the late John Thaw. Morse is a character sometimes sad, but always admirable. Kevin Whately, as the often naive and naive Lewis, is the perfect contrast to Morse's intellect and love of culture. The individual plots offer the usual plot of twists, twists and red jokes in order to keep you guessing, but the stories are not pretentious in their complexity. If you like solid detective dramas with a good dose of English culture, then this series is in its alley.""",1

"b'I vaguely remember the game in which this movie was titled and was a fan of some of the old films of Christian Slater, so even after knowing that it was a horrible movie, I decided to rent it. I have a strange affection for bad science fiction movies because it\'s fun to see how ridiculous writing is and how bad the special effects are, not to mention that all the unnamed actors are trying to pretend they can act. Unfortunately, this movie was not fun in any way, form or form. Christian Slater is a good actor and the film seemed to have a decent budget for the creatures, which were very lively, but beyond these two points, this film did not even qualify for a direct channel for Sci-Fi. \'\' launch . There was no fun in this movie. The story made no sense at all, the supporting actors were very tough and none of the characters seemed to care about any of the other characters. At one point in the movie, Christian Slater mentions ""I just killed my friend,"" just as you would say, ""I just poured my coffee into a smeared pants I was about to throw away."" . I think I could summarize the whole movie. The actors did not seem to care, the director did not seem to care, the editors did not seem to care, in fact the only prople that actually seemed to do decent work in the middle of the way were the entertainers who cheered the audience.

This is a movie that I would normally give a 4 or even a five star, but the WB pumped this thing without even bothering to check the sound mix, or maybe they have edited it somehow incomprehensible to me. For whatever reason, you'd almost be buying the VHS better, as it will have the full soundtrack and will probably be almost as good.

"b""It looks like good movies inspire remakes. As to whether they are & quot; inspired & quot; remakes are always open to questioning. Both versions of The Italian Job have unique features that make them interesting but for sheer acting and fun (with the exception of Ed Norton in the remake, which looks like he's stuck in a movie he does not like), 1969. s The Job Italian is my personal choice of the two. Mark Wahlberg can not hold a candle (and not a very frank actor) to Michael Caine in the original film. There are almost so many things that make this classic movie work like there are seconds on a clock. The plot focuses more on escape than the caper. This unique twist turned the shape on his head. The fantastic cast (including the late Noel Coward in his last screen appearance and, among all, Benny Hill!) Features the wonderful Michael Caine in the lead. He gives a great performance and helps the group prepare for the occasion. The late Peter Collinson directs with energy and intelligence bringing to life what might have been, despite his twists in the plot, a routine film. Collinson is a kind of cult director who died relatively young before fulfilling his promise as a director. I would also recommend his classic psychological thriller Straight On Till Morning, which became available last year on DVD. Although hampered by some visual and editorial conventions of the mid-1970s, Morning has more than her own with the explosion films of the time. The movie set-up is a track of comments that features the original producer of the film as well as number of enjoyable extras. It's great to have this secondary classic finally restored in its proper proportion. The transfer of the DVD is very good and although the print quality varies a bit, it is really good overall.""",1

Although it is gone and Lois moves to another man, love is definitely still there. So, of course, there\'s the ongoing battle between Lex Luthor and Superman, so it\'s like having two great stories in one movie! There is emotional chemistry in this film that is undeniable.

"b'Director Jon Reiss and producer Tracy Wares take us on a graffiti world tour in ""Bomb It"". The film is more favorable to graphite than against it, but interviews individuals whose mission is to rid graffiti and graffiti quarters on 4 continents. There is a chain that questions who should decide what we look at in public spaces, a provocative question, but it is not really the focus of the film. ""Bomb It"" covers much of the history and scope of graffiti art, but with good results, since we are able to see that graffiti artists are not all the same. Graphite has evolved over time, and its purpose is different in different cultures and subcultures. ""Bomb It"" begins by interviewing Cornbread, a Philadelphia whose campaign to mark everything with his nickname in 1967 can make him the first modern graffiti artist. The film avoids the ""who did what is first"" debate, but follows the progression from simple marking to more elaborate lyrics that have led to the transformation of graffiti from a subclass counterculture movement to one that encompasses a broader artistic movement. New York graffiti artists in the 1970s and 1980s talk about their exploits before the city began to aggressively clean up graffiti on public property. Other cities whose artists are presented are: Paris, France; Amsterdam, The Netherlands; London, United Kingdom ; Berlin, Germany ; Barcelona, \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bSpain; Cape Town, South Africa; S\xc3\xa3o Paulo Brazil ; Tokyo, Japan ; and Los Angeles, USA. I always thought of graffiti as a frustrated, energetic, but mostly irresponsible youth medium that attacked what they perceived as the status quo. Now I\'ve learned that graffiti has different meanings in different cultures. In South Africa, graphite was a tool for political change. In Los Angeles, he is part of the Chicano movement and has taken the trap of a lifestyle in some sectors. In some cultures, the emphasis is more on putting works of art in public spaces than in counter-culture. Not surprisingly, these artists have a less contradictory relationship with communities and the law. The fact is that graffiti and vandalism have a profound effect on the rate of more serious crimes. And many of the artists interviewed are faced with extremely important people who inflict their spleen on others because their lives are not as they would like. On the other hand, it can not be denied that graphite is sometimes an improvement over discouraged, decadent buildings, or that artists are talented, or that some of the opponents of graphite are politically philistine. ""Bomb It"" provides an introduction to graffiti and its controversies, showing us the art, ideas and differences of opinion. The DVD (Docurama 2008): There are 3 featurettes and a feature commentary. In `` Behind the Scenes \'\' (14 min), director Jon Reiss talks about the genesis of the project, filming in different countries, setting the film and some themes. ""Extended Time Lapse Sequences"" (15 min) are 3 sequences, 5 minutes each in England, Brazil and Japan, where we can watch the art being created in an accelerated time. There are also ""Extended Interviews"" (26 min). The audio commentary by director Jon Reiss and producer Tracy Wares is constant and informative.

"b""You will not regret ! If I had known how fun and clever this movie was, I would have taken my son to see when he was at the movies.

Disney sets aside sentimental sentimentality in this film to emphasize humor and humor. A great example is the portrait of Pacha's pregnant wife at home alone with two young children who cleverly use their children to thwart antagonists. Surprising and extremely funny. As banal as it may seem, this movie & quot; works on many levels & quot; providing intelligent adult humor with great visuals and jokes for kids.

"b'Most movies are about Christ or Paul or Joseph or Moses. This film is not just about Jesus the Christ but tells the personalities of the apostles themselves. It makes the observer understand that they have the same strengths and weaknesses as the apostles. Doubting Thomas. Peter and his temper. Mateus . James and John, sons of Zebedee. It is also about each apostle as much as about the Christ. The version of the Last Supper and what each apostle must have thought when Christ announced that one of them would betray them is extremely touching. This made all these people very real and human. for me .'",1
"b'Early Hackman, very early Melanie Griffith. Cohesive and provocative script that will keep you in good position for repeated viewing. Interesting photography, particularly the underwater photos.

A good movie, solid and well done. The director should be commended.'",1
"b""It seemed like for years you did not even need to be a tabloid junkie to follow Britney Spears. Their antics were not scattered all over the cover of the magazine, but they hit the national evening news! You also do not have to be a genius to find out that half of the stuff in these magazines did not look quite right, though. Finally, Britney shows us a bit what it's like to be the most famous celebrity in the world. Some critics say that this does not really explain everything. (Why did she shave her head?) How did this guy take control of her life?) She touches most of the high points, but the poor girl's life is public enough - we can at least allow her to keep SOME secrets to herself? You're probably a fan of Britney if you're looking at this, so I doubt I have to convince you that her song is incredible. I recommend this DVD not only because it is important to the fans, but it is definitely a historical video that has led to one of the greatest returns of all time.""",1
"b'For the plot outline, see the back of the DVD box: ""Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) is a private investigator specializing in unexplained supernatural phenomena. Their cases plunge into the dark corners of the world, seeking the truth in the hidden remnants of ancient civilizations. Now the greatest mystery of his past is about to become the most dangerous case he has ever faced. With the help of his ex-girlfriend, archaeologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid), and his bitter rival, government agent Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff), Edward is about to learn this just because you do not believe in something that does not . t means it can not kill you! ""According to the character of Carnby, the fear of the dark is what keeps us alive. Unfortunately, however, the fear of bad movies does not stop us from renting them. Despite the awful reviews, I decided to give in to the temptation to rent Alone In The Dark (I had a free lease, so I figured there could not be much loss). It was even worse than I expected ... On the one hand, creatures that are released from the depths of darkness - or whatever the clich\xc3\xa9 of horse feces is scattered throughout history - are pathetic CGI dinosaurs. Anything interesting, scary or just ""cool"" about them? Do not . Only nonsense computer-generated monsters that can not entertain the public in the simplest way. For two, the acting is horrendous. Seeing Tara Reid on the DVD\'s top credits made me roll my eyes, but seeing her trying to act as an archaeologist in a science fiction movie made me laugh. The only decent performance midway is given by Christian Slater, but still not enough to cover up the rest. And for three, the film is terribly boring, with few action scenes. Oh, of course, some unknown bumps here and there, some creatures flashing on the screen, and a little blood is included. But the real action? Very little . The small amounts of action he did include the reason why I gave this stinker two stars. I hate watching a movie suffer, but this one deserves it. In conclusion, do not make the same mistakes that most of these reviewers did by renting the movie, knowing how awful it should be. Just rely on the ratings of this one. You will save your money and your time.'",0
"b""I bought this because I'm a big fan of cowboys and I thought it would be fun to learn some of the DCC routines. I read a bit negative reviews from other customers, but I'm not in the best shape so I thought it would be fine for me. WRONG! First, the DVD is short, about 45 minutes from start to finish. You only have one dance routine, which is divided into four parts. I was expecting a bit of fun dance music (similar to what cheerleaders do), and it was a techno-type track. I also found that some of the girls' voices were particularly annoying. I did not feel energized or as if I had burned any calories. All in all, this product was a big disappointment to me.""",0
"b""I bought the Cut from this film for Director Semeste with great expectation. I loved the theatrical version of Pitch Black. It's one of my favorite science fiction films, no doubt. It's a waste of money. The additions to the film were so few and so subtle that I barely noticed them. The part without evaluation? More violence? Not visibly. More cursing? More naked skin? No, none of these. And the extras? They are almost non-existent. There is nothing on this DVD that I did not get in the first, except some propaganda about the continuation, and even that was not very convincing. Seriously, if you already own this movie on DVD, do not waste your money on this reprint. If you do not have this DVD movie, see if you can find the original release. At least it has the theatrical trailers.""",0
"b""I can not tell a joke well. A bad joke is not funny, no matter who says it, but a person like me can make a bad joke. A story also needs to be told well and, in the case of a movie, filmed well, to be interesting. The problem with AntiTrust is that it is a tale that is not counted or filmed very well. It is lovely to look at, but it has no electricity or soul. Milo [Ryan Phillippe] is a computer genius. Outside of college, he plans to start a business with some friends out of a garage, just as his computer heroes did twenty years ago. They plan to make their mark on cyberspace. One day, seemingly out of nowhere, Milo and his best friend are approached by Gary Winston [Tim Robbins], who wants them to come and work for their giant multinational company. It seems that Winston is about to launch a computer program that will revolutionize communications, but he needs some good geeks to get him up and running. The friend, a wise young man, decides to keep his original plan, but Milo is sucked. Along with his girlfriend Alice [Claire Forlani], he packs up and moves to Portland, Oregon, home to the Nurve Corporation of Winston. It will not be long until Milo suspects that Winston will literally kill to get what he wants. Advances in the programming of the new product always seem to happen soon after the mysterious death of some brilliant programmer. One of the problems of the film is with part of the cast. Tim Robbins is just like Winston, making him look and act as much as Bill Gates which is a bit scary. Ryan Phillippe, however, I can not buy like any kind of genius. He has done a good job in the past, playing roles as a sociopath [Cruel Intentions], a psychopath [The Way of the Gun] and a party-goer [54]. But a computer whiz? I think not . Rachael Lee Cook is just as unbelievable as Lisa, a fellow programmer. Claire Forlani, who may be a star soon, is just as Alice is but a part that is below her capabilities. AntiTrust belongs to the paranoid suspense genre. This is the only one in which only the hero has discovered a diabolical plot. By the end of the movie, the rest of the characters are almost always blind to the truth and tend to believe that the hero is simply stressed. Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window is a classic example of this type of film. To succeed, the film must make the audience care for the protagonist. Must relate to him. This does not happen in AntiTrust. Milo is simply insipid and lame to keep our interest. It's one of those cases where, if we relate to anyone, it's for the villain, Winston. At least he's insightful and somehow humorous. You know a movie is in trouble when we start cheering on the villain.""",0
"b'This is a very well made and well filmed sequence. The opening sequence and the sequels with the sniper firing indiscriminately at the fleeing crowd were very memorable and well executed. However, I was completely undecided about how simple it was for the father to access his wife, who should be in some sort of quarantine. I know there are often lapses in logic and suspensions of disbelief in many movies and I am guilty of succumbing to some of them. But this was very glaring to me. By crying out loud, either the US Army was completely incompetent or the filmmakers did not think it would be so glaring to the public. Who in good conscience does not put the mother in quarantine with at least one guard at the door, let alone a nurse or a technician monitoring it? ? ? ? ? ? Instead, the installation was deserted. It was too simple for her father to access it with a pass card or not. If a person were still alive 28 weeks later without symptoms in a quarantine zone in the real world, that person would be locked and the video monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, if not weeks, because they want to know how she survived and as she was ""immune"" to this virus. Such precautions would never be taken lightly, especially when you are dealing with a virus that has nearly wiped out a whole country! If they did not have strict protocals, we would have been eliminated like a race a long time ago. The suspension of disbelief in this film really prevented me from enjoying a movie well done.'",0
"b'Clint Eastwood takes on the role of director and actor here, starring Walt Kowalski, an old grumpy racist who changes his mind in ""Gran Torino."" Walt\'s journey is just one of several that make up the film. It begins with the funeral of Walt\'s beloved wife, whom we never see, but somehow meet a kinder soul than Walt, and probably a positive influence in that it keeps his most unpleasant character traits at bay. In the days after the funeral, we see Walt alone and bitter, estranged from the rest of his family and seemingly unable to make emotional connections. One of the things that make it so bitter is that its neighborhood is becoming more and more Asian. North America is changing, and places that were once almost exclusively white are now more multi-racial or, in some cases, dominated by a particular ethnic group. This neighborhood has a growing number of Hmong (a Southeast Asian ethnic group), and it is safe to say that Walt was not too happy to see its increasing numbers over the years. At the beginning of the film, he is a racist, not just ""old and defined in his ways"", not just ""narrow-minded"" but also racist. The fact that the film does not try to sugarcoat makes the character transformation much more powerful. There are two main interpersonal \'pulls\' in the film - one is Walt being pulled against his will to the fabric of the neighborhood, the other is a Hmong kid of about 15 (I estimate), Thao (Bee Vang) - Walt is the neighbor on the side - being pulled against his will to a street gang dominated by Hmong. He is the cousin of one of the gang\'s bosses, and therefore, as the gang expands more and more from its traditional strongholds to the suburbs, Thao is invited to participate. In the classic gang style, it\'s an offer he can not refuse. Then, little by little, he is being sucked into that lifestyle he wants very much to avoid, but he seems powerless for that. His feat of initiation in the gang is stealing the classic car of the neighbor Walt, Gran Torino. When he is caught red-handed and the other members flee, his family decides that his punishment is to \'help\' Walt with yard work, housekeeping, etc. for a short time, as atonement. Walt is not interested and refuses the deal, but Thao is forced to try to make amends anyway. Shortly thereafter, an incident occurs in the neighborhood involving the gang, and Walt becomes the neighborhood hero by expelling some gang members. To Walt\'s horror, this seems to encourage the neighborhood\'s Hmong community to ""adopt"" him, arriving with gifts, baskets and food, always saluting him warmly, apparently oblivious to the fact that Walt does not like them much. . Of course, despite his hostility toward Asians, he never met anyone outside of his experiences in the Korean War where they were on opposite sides (he seems to have many memories of Koreans as enemies, but few of the South Koreans as allies on your side). As he is involuntarily drawn to the community, his feelings towards his Hmong neighbors slowly begin to change ... This may sound clich\xc3\xa9d or artificial, but absolutely nothing in the movie comes out that way. Each characterization and interaction - good or bad - seems very genuine. During this time, we see Walt trying and not reestablishing some kind of connection with his biological family; we also see him very shocked at himself for being so close to his \'new\' family, particularly Thao and his older sister Sue (Ahney Her), for whom he seems to be filling some sort of uncle. paternal role Meanwhile, the other pull is still happening - the gang\'s determination to recruit Thao, apparently motivated mainly by the fact that they are offended at the idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bsomeone refusing them. Thao is increasingly determined not to follow this path, but this seems only to make the gang more insistent. Gran Torino gives a good picture of the hard place that someone like Thao is when he is targeted for recruiting like this by a gang who can do anything if he does not agree with them. It\'s a situation your family sees, and that Walt also recognizes. The film becomes extremely intense in its final stages, building a tremendously powerful end. What is most unexpected is all the humor and, for want of a better word, ""heat"" that starts to get in about a third of the way. These elements do not clash with tension, but provide a counterpoint. And, as we see in the film, things can go from very ""happy"" to very, very somber. The ability to deal with seemingly disparate tones and universally excellent performances helps make Gran Torino a great movie at all levels. For a skillful blend of drama, tenderness and vicious suspense, you can not go better than this.'",1
"b""This movie is mandatory - one that you can watch at least once a year. It's fun with great performances by Sig Weaver and Melanie Griffith. Although Melanie is a very average actress, her style works in this film. The type of character required, that is. Ditzy blonde, meant that she could be herself really. Also, your baby voice works for the role. Working Girl is a beauty comedy focused on an unlikely rise to the top, but when you think about it carefully, it shows that anyone can get anywhere, if you have determination and courage. This is a good message to convey, I feel. Working Girl might have made Melanie a big star, but she did not open the doors she thought it would be. She may have gotten more roles after that, but none of them were worth watching! I mean failures like Bonfire Vanities, Stormy Monday (simple, of course!), Shining Through, and one with ex-husband Don Johnson - the title escapes me. I think Melanie's inability to get rid of that baby voice really killed her career.""",1
"b'I think this is a horrible video. The first 57 minutes teaches things like: - what is vibrato - how to do hammer ons, pull offs, trills - A (G) major arpeggio (it plays - with no explanation as the root, then the 3rd, then the 5th, now I repeat it ""or something like that, he just plays an arpeggio.) Big-boosted and chordless chords (he plays them with very little explanation other than one has a fifth plane and the other has a fifth stratified - no. he says that if you want to know more you should go buy a book!) -A George Van Eps lickOK, here\'s the thing ... These are all EXTREMELY BASIC.These are things that anyone who plays guitar there is more than one year or two should already know, most of the time.Maybe not in and out, but he does not teach in & for most of the above, he gives only one example with very little explanation. Gypsy jazz.Oh, but in the last 2 or 3 minutes he plays a Gyps jazz song He could have picked up exactly the same video and played a song from Yngwie Malmsteen at the end and called the video & quot; neoclassical flooring & quot; and would have been exactly like & quot; valid & quot; like calling it a gypsy jazz video! Now, I imagine someone who wants to join Gypsy Jazz already knows how to make hammers and pull them out. If they do not, they need to continue practicing for many years before attempting to tackle gypsy jazz. So who is this video for? Paul Mehling really know? There is no theory in this video at all. ANYTHING ! He does not tell you when to touch the scales and trills, etc. what it shows you, or how they relate to the chords, or anything. There is no rhythmic placement examination of notes when solos (that would be the SWING part of the guitar swing gypsy). There is no examination of which scales django prefers on which chords, none of that. Here are some basic techniques that any beginning guitar student should know, now see me playing a Django song without any explanation. & quot; There is no dissection or ripping of the Djangos style, as suggested by another reviewer. Nothing like that. Nor is it a primer on jazz improvisation in my opinion. The sad thing is that this video could have been so much more. Paul is obviously an excellent player and knows the style. He does not teach well though. There are many excellent guitarists who are not good teachers. Paul seems to be one of these. Someone should tell him! I am now going to eBay to sell my video to someone else.

I have a strange affection for bad science fiction movies because it\'s fun to see how ridiculous writing is and how bad the special effects are, not to mention that all the unnamed actors are trying to pretend they can act. Unfortunately, this movie was not fun in any way, form or form. Christian Slater is a good actor and the film seemed to have a decent budget for the creatures, which were very lively, but beyond these two points, this film did not even qualify for a direct channel for Sci-Fi. \'\' launch . There was no fun in this movie. The story made no sense at all, the supporting actors were very tough and none of the characters seemed to care about any of the other characters. At one point in the movie, Christian Slater mentions ""I just killed my friend,"" just as you would say, ""I just poured my coffee into a smeared pants I was about to throw away."" . I think I could summarize the whole movie. The actors did not seem to care, the director did not seem to care, the editors did not seem to care, in fact the only prople that actually seemed to do decent work in the middle of the way were the entertainers who cheered the audience. After watching this movie I felt very sad for Christian Slater. Your career must be completely over now. I\'m depressed . Time to watch Madagascar and cheer up.'",0

"b'As a parent, I really enjoy watching Thomas shows and movies. I prefer trains and Thomas is the standard for children\'s train movies. However, this film is a dramatic drift and has a thoughtless storyline decorated with absurdity. In short, Thomas accidentally descends to an island five miles off the coast of Brendam. Despite the FIVE MILE submarine tunnel linking Sodor to Misty Island and the proximity to the coast, none of them have seen Misty Island. Thomas meets new trains on the misty island (Dash, Bash and Ferdinand) who were sent into exile on the island for not being really useful and together work hard to exploit an endangered tree to build a rescue station. Everything works out in the end, but they waste valuable time in history, for logistical reasons, to find some of the people who were out finding Thomas before he rescues himself (if that makes sense). It must have at least made sense to the writers that this was a horrible story. Also introduced in this story is the captain (a boat) who is the only one who has an English accent as all the people who frequent the sea have English accents. Finally, Hit Entertainment, which brings together the films of Thomas, makes the film another logistical challenge, removing the function of the menu button, thus avoiding the previous ones, it is only possible to press the ""jump"" button a million times.

The third season features Medusa, a caveman, flying Dutchman, abominable snowman, a fire-breathing dinosaur, a two-headed dinosaur and a beetle whose bite makes you sick! Logic, continuity and characterization go out the window. Sleestak and Chaka talk, Enik does stupid things in the name of ""logic."" The only thing better this season is the acting.

"b""After being greatly disappointed by Spirited Killer, I set my expectations much lower for this movie. Unfortunately, it's even worse than the Spirited Killer. The story is not worth going over. Basically, there's a guy who knows where a valuable stone is. An evil general and his men want the stone and are trying to get it. There is also a group of good guys trying to find the guy who knows where the stone is. This is the story. Tony Jaa plays one of the bad guys and looks very well in his two fight scenes, but all the other fights are very bad. Some of the acrobatics are good, but not on par with most of the other Panna Rittikrai films. The good guys have a Rambo guy on their side and he drags the movie because his moves are very slow. But overall the main reason for this movie being so bad is because there are not many fights. I can handle a bad story as long as the fights are good, but this movie does not predict that. Even the grand finale is not worth staying around. There are some decent blasts, but nothing to get excited about. This movie really makes you appreciate how much effort has been put into 2 Panna Born to Fight movies. The picture quality is surprisingly good (good, good for Videoasia). There is a HORRIBLE dubbing track in English, but fortunately there is also an original language track and subtitles. The only reason this 2 disc DVD gets more than 1 star is because of the special features.4 Minute interview with Tony Jaa talking about Tom Yum Goong.

Good things here, but nothing you have not seen before, if you're a fan of Jaa. 22-minute interview with the producer of Pechpanna Films and a director / actor of the company. Incredible interview! They talk about some really cool things, like a new Thai movie called The Brave. It's not subtitled and the dubbing is really tacky, but it really makes it nicer (for me, at least). And there are some good action scenes mixed up in the interview.3 Tony Jaa interview. It looks like they're just trying to stack the special features with this. The only thing to talk about is a 1 minute demonstration that they show at the end of the interview.

Then we see the contrasting impact of the encounter on the scene. two boys - Jamie growing up in self-confidence and Ste struggling to reconcile her sexuality with her status as ""one of the boys"" and afraid her father and brother would find out.

The main actors are not bits in the Hollywood sense. They are sweet - really cute - but fairly common k ids in looks and aspirations, which makes it an easy movie for gay teenagers to relate to. Also note the suggestions that Sandra has a gay side - her closest relationship is not with her boyfriend Tony, but with her work partner Louise. is a sexual predator and presents himself as a pet and with a hint of sexual ambiguity.

Patricia Neal was the name of Fannie, but when she started acting, the name was obviously taken away, so her father told her to come up with a memorable name. The Fannie Flagg is nothing but memorable. She's a very funny woman ... and an excellent author. The movie is worth seeing again.""",1

What you have is a realistic war story that deals with men who risk their lives and become obsessed with the fear of not coming back. Greg Peck gives a great performance, strong and also vulnerable in the end. Considering that this movie was made in 1949, it is certainly one. If you love war movies with a lot of action, a bewitched girl and a vision of HOLLYWOOD, do not watch this movie, it's simply beyond you.""",1
"b'The ""Prisoner of Zenda"" of 1922 is surely one of the best silent movies ever made. Its main actors knew better than to exaggerate and, obviously, had a very competent director in Rex Ingram. Even if the plot, the costumes and the scenario are taken from an operetta, the players generally appear natural, demonstrating that good acting was not something that somehow emerged with the advent of sound. Even Ramon Navarro as the villainous Rupert of Hentzau shows up much more than just a cute face as he turns his role into a fun, animated tour. The tour begins at the mansion of Englishman Rudolph Rassendyll, the camera zeroing in on the eyes extremely handsome Lewis Stone, now a 43-year veteran who, in most other respects, looks like a fairly normal middle-aged man in good physical condition. But of course, there is nothing in common with Stone\'s histrionic talent, and he has all the charm that made him as dear as Judge Hardy, about 15 years later, in the Andy Hardy series. Rassendyll decides to attend the coronation of his cousin, Rudolph of Ruritania [whose twin brother he could be] and thinks his relative is a dissipated mess. Lewis Stone plays the two parts, needless to say. The feeble future king has an ambitious but evil brother, Duke Michael, who plans to take the throne for himself and kill Rudolph in the process. On the eve of the coronation, the duke causes his brother to be drugged, so that he is not in a position to attend the ceremony. Therefore, the king\'s legalists persuade the British Rassendyll to take their place for a day and prevent Michael from doing so. The Ruritarian Rudolph has a beautiful bride played by the luminous Alice Terry. The couple does not have much use for each other, but she is a popular princess that would serve to reinforce the unstable position of Rudolph. Meanwhile, Rassendyll and the lovely girl meet at the same time, and sensing an unexpected change in their intention, the princess no longer sees her role as the future queen as a simple duty. Of course, the plot thickens and there is another woman involved, played by the seductive but less natural actress, Barbara La Marr. Rudolph Rassendyll can not go to England after the coronation, but must continue to help rescue his cousin in extinction. There is a lot of skull and sword play as well. Everyone makes a fascinating movie and it\'s a great revelation to see how effective a younger, more corollous version of old Judge Hardy is in the love scenes. Very sexy! Probably not by chance that the actor who played the double role in the next ""Prisoner of Zenda"", Ronald Colman, looked a lot like Lewis Stone.'",1
"b""When I first saw the trailer for & quot; From Hell & quot; I was understandably ecstatic. Based on the graphic novel of the same name, written by Alan Moore, I had high hopes for this. Judging from previous ones, it seemed the Hughes brothers could do it justice. But unfortunately, when the film adaptations of the books usually go, they massacred it. Let's start with the character of Johnny Depp, Inspector Abberline. They transform him from an honest, hard-working detective who slowly develops some feelings for a young prostitute, into an opium-addicted clairvoyant who falls madly in love with the prostitute mentioned (Heather Graham). And speaking of Heather Graham, could they have made a more horrible choice for a 19th-century prostitute? The other prostitutes in the movie look, well, as they should (ugly), but Graham stands out like a sore thumb. As for the story, this carnage is typical of the great Hollywood movies. The book focused on the character of Jack the Ripper, more than any other in history. In fact, it was revealed in Chapter 2! That was what made it so fascinating: the book entered the murderer's head and tried to explain the motivations for his murders, in addition to the obvious ones presented in the film. He deconstructed and analyzed a truly distorted mind and attempted to convey how, in Alan Moore's words, & quot; The human experience was to the limit ... then it went beyond & quot; . The movie transforms into a typical whodunit, keeping you guessing until it is revealed at the end. Anyway, I remember long enough. Watch the movie if you want - for pure entertainment, you'll probably enjoy it. But if you want a richly textured and fascinating, yet fictional, story about one of the most notorious serial killers of all time, read the book.""",0
"b""I remember as if it were yesterday. I was 24 when this movie came out and lived in Miami, Florida. I had long hair (very long) and was dating an absolute hottie. So over the weekend that this movie came out, I was dragged into this movie by my girlfriend. In fact, it was a group of us, three couples and all the guys were dragged by their girlfriends. 24-year-olds, long-haired guys in heavy metal are not the type to fancy a girls' movie, so none of us was really happy to be there. To make the film a bit more enjoyable, we were in a slightly altered state. '' But this little movie has conquered us! And none of us were single at the time either. I also really related to the character Matt Dillon because that's exactly how I was living my life back then. I can not add anything more than what others have said, since the film works so well because it's not silly. , it's not forced, it's not clich\xc3\xa9, and it's not tacky. There was just something so honest and natural about the movie. And even though at the time I was seriously annoyed with the advent of grunge music killing the precious heavy metal I loved so much, I ended up enjoying the music too. This was the real grunge, before music companies turned grunge into the top 40 of crap, and before designers / garment manufacturers turned the clothes from the second-hand shop into extremely expensive designer clothing. This really piqued my interest in Seattle and I remember wanting to change them for a few years after seeing this movie (I never did). As my title says, this is a girl movie that even the guys will like because it escapes all the classic traps of the typical girl movie. Acting and writing are top notch, as is music and the city of Seattle. Since then, I have seen the film in an unaltered state and has lost none of its charm, originality and innocence. This film captures a period in time that was fun, innocent, carefree, fresh and exciting, before the dot-com bubble before September 11, before record gas prices, and before the implosion of our entire economy. Not only does the 20s of today do not have a movie like Singles to call their own, they do not have much future to look forward to as well.""",1
"b'An aged stripper exerts great powers on others with the help of a mysterious amulet on sin, his sinners. The word ""aging"" seems to be a gentle way of saying that. It appears that Mama\'s 30-year-old middle-aged contract is about to expire soon, although this does not appear to threaten her dominance over entrepreneur Dave and his daughter. Neither do the saints preserve us, which prevents it from crunching and beating every 15 minutes or more. Dave, Mom bought and paid for a boy toy, is his manager and bongo companion when it exercises its second office as a spiritualist amuleta that specializes in robbing the rich. Dave is also horny for his daughter, and his 20-something daughter is horny for Dave, but neither can he irritate a hormone while Mama uses the amulet. Even though Mommy, saints preserve us, move and tremble in her bikini with the bangs on top, this is not really a blue movie. Besides being horrible, I do not know what it is or how to explain it. The second trinket this dvd, the reason why I caught him in the first place, is the scripted movie and starring Lenny Bruce (the only real film in which he has been) DANCE HALL RACKET. This is about a dance hall that deceives your client and the girls dancing in the lounge. Bruce is a revered by standing comedians as a pioneering genius, topical, pioneer of the first order. This may all be true, but his first script-credited script does not confirm. Without standing, no jokes, no ha-ha in this. This stinks. It does not help that the impression of transference was in a bad state, and sometime between 1953 and today someone took all the brief nudie shots in the girls\' dressing room. Losing quick glimpses is no big deal, but it messes up the soundtrack and dialogue and makes some conversations even more ridiculous than I imagine they would be otherwise. Two stinkers for the price of one. Not recommended as entertainment, although this is probably the best chance you have of seeing a floor and talking to Lenny Bruce. If this is not done for you, avoid this DVD as the plague.'",0
"b'Adam Sandler performs well in this follow-up to ""Magnolia"" by director Paul Thomas Anderson. Emily Watson is equally good.

"b'While ""Singin \'in the Rain"" of 1952 is definitely the most complete musical film, I think this 1949 classic seems to be the best that MGM produced during the golden age of Hollywood when the talents were at their peak. Co-directed by Gene Kelly and 25-year-old Stanley Donen in his directorial debut, the film has a consistently propulsive energy thanks mainly to the remarkable choreography of Kelly and Donen, the perfect blend of Leonard Bernstein\'s familiar music with the original compositions of the studio Roger Edens, and the pure effervescence of the artists. Written by the esteemed team of Betty Comden and Adolph Green, the frayed storyline is simply about three sailors - Gabey, Chip and Ozzie - on a 24-hour license. New York and the women they know and romance. Based on a subway poster, Gabey, a womanizer, falls in love with Miss Turnstiles and spends her time looking for her. Phobia Ozzie finds romance with Claire anthropology student, while Chip, who is timid, is focused on sightseeing, despite the persistent attentions of hilarious taxi driver Hildy. The closest that the story comes of dramatic tension lies in the misunderstandings around Miss Turnstiles, who is not the big celebrity who Gabey assumes she is just an aspiring ballerina named Ivy, who has to work at night as an exotic dancer in Coney Island. is obviously at its best when focused on musical sequences - beginning with the actual locations used for ""New York, New York"" in establishing the energetic arrival of sailors, continuing with the elaborate ""Prehistoric Man"" number at the Museum of Natural History and jumping through the title set of songs with all six directors singing and dancing descending from the top of the Empire State Building. Everyone has the chance to shine, though like Gabey, Gene Kelly clearly dominates with his graceful athletic ability. Like Chip, Frank Sinatra mostly overshadowed singing to Betty Garrett, who admirably contains her subtlety as Hildy. Though hardly credible as an academic type, Ann Miller starts beating impressively during `` Prehistoric Man \'\', and Jules with rubber-faced Munshin mainly provides comedic relief as Ozzie. When she dances instead of acting to deceive Gabey, Vera-Ellen dazzles like Ivy, of ""Miss Turnstiles Ballet"" loaded with fantasy, for her superb duets with Kelly on ""Main Street"" and ""A Day in New York Ballet"". \'. The only bitter note is the paternalistic attitude toward Hildy\'s strident roommate Lucy (played with good sense by the original Gladys Kravitz of ""Bewitched"", Alice Pearce). Harold Rosson\'s saturated color cinematography was maintained quite well in the transfer of print on the 2000 DVD, although the only extra is the theatrical trailer that is now being attacked.'",1
"b""My kids love this movie and watch in their dreams with their friends. Don Knotts plays Luther Hegg, a timid typographer in a small town in the Midwest (Rachel, Kansas). Supporting actors are foremost: Skip Homeier, Dick Sargent, Ellen Corby, and so on. Joan Staley, who plays Alma, was the center of PLAYBOY in 1958! Vivian Vance 's ex - husband Phil Ober interprets the killer and the old ladies of the boardinghouse are hilarious. Reta Shaw is very funny, since the head of the Psychic Society and the sound track of Vic Muzzy are scary. When this image was first released in cinemas in 1965, it was a big hit in small towns in the USA and very representative of the small American city of 1960. Fun!""",1

"b'My expectation from this film was that it would be more or less a compilation and reinforcement of information I had gathered from seeing the ""Fast Food Nation"" eye film several years ago and having just finished reading the excellent books. `Animal, Vegetable Miracle \'and` `In Defense of Food\' \'among others. However, this movie is more than the sum of these books and that movie. Food Inc. is an extremely well-made documentary, in part because of the personal stories told by the interviewees as well as hidden camera images. I was especially impressed with what is happening to the farmers. The material is so well researched and presented. Various aspects of food production, marketing and consumption are covered. There is no ""time out"" in this movie, it\'s one hit after another. All the shocking and important information that citizens need to worry about.

"b""The adventures of three girls in show business. ZIEGFELD GIRL is an immense musical behind the scenes, in which MGM has poured tons of talent; also marked the first mission of Pandro S. Berman with that studio after his years of success in RKO. The reason why Jimmy Stewart got the best billing for this rather patchy but fun movie is a mystery - his role is virtually minor. Robert Z. Leonard directed these two and a quarter hours of struggle, triumph, pain and music, but the two major production numbers, MINNIE FROM TRINIDAD and YOU STEPPED FOR A DREAM, were the work of the legendary wizard of motion choreography, Busby Berkeley. Judy is dear as Susan Gallagher and her scenes with her Irish Pop (Charles Winninger) are realistically performed. I felt that Lana Turner's performance is somewhat artificial and unfit in her acting technique; She plays Sheila, who succumbs to the bottle. Like Sandra, Lamarr is surprisingly beautiful, but her acting hardly stays in someone's memory! Jimmy Stewart would join the Army before this movie was premiered; he would not make another film until 1946; was a sleeper (jokingly) entitled IS A WONDERFUL LIFE.""",1
"b""This review is for the DVD edition of the Criterion DVD. The original title of the movie in French is & quot; Du Rifiif Chez les Hommes & quot; which translates to & quot; Problems with men & quot; The movie is very good and it is about several men who plan to break into a jewelry store, open the safe and escape - all without triggering the alarm. Several of the scenes were imitated in other films: notably Mission Impossible and the remake of Italain Job. Many scenes are quite exciting and the break-in scene is very exciting. This half-hour scene also does not contain any dialogue, making it one of the longest if not the longest elapsed time, without dialogue in a dialogue film. This is definitely one of the best break-in movies I've seen and is certainly worthy of a release from Criterion Collection. There are also several special features. There is a theatrical trailer, production stills and notes, a video interview with director, Jules Dassin, who also personally reviewed this edition, and drawings of the sets by Alexandre Trauner. There is also an optional English soundtrack for those bothered by foreign languages \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bwith subtitles. Anyway, this is a movie that no fan of assault movies should miss!""",1
"b'This is a dark, scary, mysterious film in which the writer has not gone far with the plot. Often, in films like this, writers make the ultimate mystery solution incredibly complicated and unrealistic. This film, on the other hand, is just complex enough to make it intriguing, while still at the top of the realism index. As much as I have enjoyed this movie, I will say that Sean Connery is one of the main reasons. Without it, the movie would probably lose a star. This is one of your best performances. F. Murray Abraham is also at his best, as the incredibly evil inquisitor. Christian Slater is not bad. The other actors in the film seem to have been found at an itinerant freak show or they had the best make-up artist of all time. What a strange-looking bunch! The film does not outnumber the blood and portrays little violence. Torture and murder usually happen off-screen. The Catholic church definitely has a black eye here. All monks and clerics (in addition to Sean C.) are shown to be at least 3 of the following: evil, active, sexually active (heterosexual and gay) and generally very dumb. However, I like to think that much of this is due to the century (14) in which the mystery takes place and, therefore, things were much more primitive. Still, Catholics may be offended if they are no longer desensitized by all the other films portrayed by the Catholic clergy. The mystery itself is a good example that should keep you guessing. Sean Connery is the only logical person in the movie and he is your guide to the solution. I liked the movie, as I think most will. Just manage your expectations, because this is a good movie, but not one of the best.'",1

I found Hugh Grant\'s performance a little toomannered, but Alan Rickman was excellent - as he is in almost everything he does - from the bad guy in "" Die Hard & quot; for ObidiahSlope in the BBC production of & quot; Barchester Towers & quot; But the outstanding performance is that of Emma Thompson, holding all this emotion.

It\'s just beautiful. The whole movie is also great, but the last scene before the final number on the real Lana Turner steals the movie. In this scene she is fatally ill and leaves the theater while Tony Martin is singing ""You came out of a dream."" In his trademark, at the top of the staircase, without any dialogue just music, she thinks of being that beautiful girl of Ziegfield again and down the stairs The music builds and then it collapses Oh what a dramatic scene This whole movie will make your heart beat and just wish Hollywood could produce something like that again.'",1

"b'`` Elvis: That\'s The It It Is \'\' captures King Presley at an interesting crossroads in his career. With his true talents largely wasted after many years in Hollywood, Elvis was usurped as the ""King of Rock and Roll"" by names like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. This documentary, filmed in the summer of 1970 as he prepared for an engagement at the International Hotel in Las Vegas, finds Elvis ready and in prime condition to reclaim his throne! The documentary shows him at 35, in shape and taste, and having a great time! To see Elvis having fun - this in itself is a joy! Elvis had a good sense of muscianship and his craft. He expected a lot from the people he worked with; and he knew exactly how to get the best of them all. It\'s obvious here that Elvis loved working with his band and back-up singers; and they loved working with him. Elvis made criticisms in a kind and funny way. When his band struggles with the Midway section of Bridge Over Troubled Water, Elvis comments, ""If that\'s the way it is, that\'s the way it is, but we need not emphasize that. `` The very recording of the show proves that Elvis may well have been the hardest working man in show business. It also proves that Elvis had ""him"" - that undefinable, often indescribable X-Factor (or, in his case, factors) that marks the difference between an artist and a superstar. Elvis was a superstar with an uppercase ""S"" - possessing a potent combination of charisma, sex appeal, musicality and charisma. The charisma of Elvis, in particular, burns the stage enough. Elvis does everything he can to please his audience. During a long rendition of ""Love Me Tender,"" he goes out into the audience, kissing so many women and shaking hands with as many men as possible. He sings a Greatest Hits Medley largely for laughter (changing the lyrics to ""forget the past, before I kick his a ##"").

Filled with shiver, edge of his seat suspense, & quot; Night of the Living Dead & quot; is a masterpiece of emotions and horror that will leave you afraid to turn out the lights. This is a great movie. If you are a fan of zombie movies, this is the movie for you. Appreciate !'",1
"b""I also danced all my life and I have no problem picking up routines. I had the worst time trying to follow your combos though. When it breaks, it does not use the same beats it uses in rhythm. When she repeats a combo the second or third time, she does not exactly do the same moves again. I do not believe she was a professional dancer. The biggest reason I do not like this is that it's high impact. Not for an old lady like me, definitely not with my hard floors. On the other hand, I also have the DVD, and I really like that.""",0
"b'If you\'ve never seen a movie coming out, this is the one to pick. One of the most critically acclaimed gay movies is a sensitive, caring, sweet, sweet story with a great Mama Cass track. The film was also acclaimed for being a good representation of the working class in British society. The film directed by Hettie McDonald and based on the script of gay writer Jonathan Harvey portrays the relationships of people in a large housing complex located in East London (I was physically there). Especially for low-income Brits, the film revolves around three families, all broken homes. Ste, coming from an abusive father and a family of brothers; Jaime, a mother and a family of boyfriends; and Leah, a British Black girl with her mother. The story is the development of a gay love relationship between two boys, Ste (played by Scott Neal) and Jaime (played by Glenn Berry). Both live side by side. They are both 16 (also in real life to maintain accuracy). It is also the story of Leah, sometimes drug user, troubled, abandoned teenager. She is a catalyst with her obsession with Mama Cass, constantly singing her songs and making a lot of noise around the apartments. I read messages in this chat room about her without understanding why she is the movie. His character contributes to the grandeur of the film. He is beaten several times by his father and brother. He takes refuge in Jaime\'s house. Jaime\'s mother, Sandra (superbly played by Linda Henry). She loves Jaime a lot and left her husband because of physical abuse. She is a strong, nonsense, caring and loving woman who runs the local bar / club in this apartment complex. She feels sorry for Ste and takes him in. Ste has to sleep on Jaime\'s bed or on a couch. Then one thing leads to another, Jaime kissing Ste.There is a trip to a local gay bar, more kisses in the woods. Sandra learns that her son has lied to her about her love for Ste. She is told by the school principal that Jaime is being teased and called ""fagot."" \'\' And the film comes to the last moments. Playing Mama Cass music late at night as she was high and almost falling off the balcony of the building, and Ste discovering that Sandra knows about them. While Sandra has been offered a better job managing a pub in another area of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bEast London, she says goodbye to her boyfriend and prepares to go out at night with the girls. Ste, Jaime and Leah getting ready to go to the gay bar again. The final scenes of the film show Ste and Jaime dancing (with a hint of Mama Cass\'s music) in an open area of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bapartment buildings, while tenants gather to watch every thing, some in bustle. Sandra steps out onto the porch next to Leah, watching what was happening below. One of the best scenes I\'ve ever seen in a movie of any kind is the extension of Leah\'s hand to Sandra (the symbolism is so powerful). By the way, Sandra and Leah fight like dogs and cats throughout the film, they mend in the closing moments. Both joined Ste and Jaime in the dance, and Sandra finally accepts the sexuality of her son. This is a very powerful film and the title is very appropriate. Both Glenn and Scott claimed in interviews that they received thousands of letters after the movie asking if they were gay. Glenn disappeared from the screen and Scott did some small things. The language is difficult to understand at times. There are websites with the slang dictionary used by the working class in Britain. Someone put a script for a sequel on the Internet, it\'s very good. This is a ""great""'",1
"b'They do not do that anymore. This is really despicable. In fact, sex far outstrips violence. And the many sex scenes are pretty graphic, bordering on hardcore. It is also unpleasant, most notably in the scene of the massage parlor, where a sadist hits a woman with a belt. A SCREAM ON THE STREETS revolves around the two cops\' fight against criminal thieves, a lurking tone and a serial killer crossdressing. , which looks HORRIBLE. And his female victims are not very smart, since he approaches them as a very unconvincing ""woman"", and they (including a female plain-cloth detective!) Do not even realize it! Like many police films of his time, SCREAM ... has an openly self-righteous stance. Stay tuned for the final scene, which also makes good use of the split-screen technique, which was very popular in the early 70\'s. As you probably guessed, this is not politically correct and because of that a lot of fun! The picture quality is very impressive. SWV did a great job with the transfer. As usual, the SWV DVD offers many extra features. There is, of course, the movie trailer, which includes images not shown in the movie. In all, there are a dozen trailers, both from US exploration and from old French crime films. My personal favorite among the trailers is THE GODSON, starring Uschi DIGARD (this movie will be released on DVD soon). An option `` play everything \'\' for the trailers would have been helpful. We also included five shorts, which I liked most about PROWLER. As a true crime fan, this 60s black and white instruction film for cops was a sight very appealing to me. Equally interesting is CRIME IN THE STREET, an instructional crime prevention documentary showing a young Chuck NORRIS (then a karate trainer). The movie is fun, but somehow pointless, because all the advice given is so well known and common sense. I did not like the other three short films. HARRY NOVAK, CRIME BUSTER is a kind of documentary, where a film crew visits movie producer Harry NOVAK. After playing with NOVAK (joking), he suggests that they visit a business partner, who paid with a missing check. NOVAK wields a samurai sword and a rifle to improve his arguments. Strange business customs ... Another short film is an extremely silly, boring sex beyond belief and due to the almost unwatchable horrible print quality. The last short feature is a black and white burlesque striptease. Boring, and by the way: You can not see something. Much better is Harry NOVAK\'s extensive film gallery. Buy the DVD, but it\'s best to skip the last three shorts on the extra features.'",1
"b""This is a movie that is more about redemption than about purebred issues. Kowalski lives in a dilapidated part of Detroit, where he is a retired worker and a veteran of the Korean War. He is a grumpy old man who despises everything and apparently everyone. His nieghborhood is totally Hmong, with the only exception being him. We see him with his family, and interacting with his neighbors and then as you saw in the trailers, his dealings with the local youth. He begins a relationship with Thao and Sue, young Hmong neighbors that he creates an affinity for. Totally politically incorrect, Kowalski vomits racial and ethnic slurs in almost every sentence. He's a bit of a loaner, especially since he became a widower, but he likes his car and his house and wishes his world has not changed so much. Kowalski calls everyone's names on their faces and he really does not care what kind of climb up, leaves people. He basically offends evryone, whites, blacks, hispanics, asians. But you see young gangs from a variety of ethical perspectives and their own racism. Tao and Sue are like the ones you hear in the news, children who have problems come to them simply because they live in these areas. Kowalski knows the Hmong and they know him. He defends his home, his property and his friends. Realism, while surreal, has our senses impacted when you see the results of the fight. Sometimes it takes more of the same. Kowalski, although he is a figure of redemption, it impacts everyone who knows him eventually, but the biggest impact is in the viewer of Gran Torino. The extras on the DVD are good, more about cars than about society. I wish there were more on the inner city and gang issues to complement our love affair with the big muscle cars.""",1
"b""I bought this thought that I would be getting a portion of one of my childhood favorites, Hollywood and the Stars. That is not. (Ah, the dangers of online shopping ...) This disc contains three chapters (called episodes), consisting of World War II related news images, but the resemblance to Hollywood and the Stars ends there. Instead of narration by the inimitable Joseph Cotten, we are treated with occasional comments from Eric Sevareid. Certainly, Mr. Sevareid is a legend among journalists, but he simply does not cut it if someone is waiting for Joseph Cotten (not to mention the beautiful theme song by the late Elmer Bernstein). If you have to buy this, do it on your website. own risk and because its content is not 'Hollywood and the Stars'' is of interest to you, not the list (I bought quite cheaply from a third-party seller of Amazon, but any waste of money is painful for me). Why worth it, I noticed that it is playable in all regions, but I do not know if it will convert from NTSC to PAL. My advice is do not bother trying to figure it out.""",0
"b'""Lost Highway"" is not so linear and therefore satisfies our narrative desire as ""Mulholland Drive"" because in fact it seems to be very difficult to be weird. But David Lynch is one of the only directors who understands how strangely dreamy cinema can be. Like Hitchcock, he exploits this situation with all his courage, but in the manner of the classic surrealists, and I think this film can be best experienced on the stage of a real theater. The terrain of this film is even more profoundly subconscious than \'Mulholland Drive\', because its ultimate theme seems to be the act of watching a narrative film itself as channeled through a model of truth in our society: crime. That\'s what makes it interesting. It is so open, however, that it allows each viewer their own personal interpretation because the ""surface plot"" is mixed with their own interpretive clues ... My opinion is that Fred Madison believes he was convicted of murdering his wife with based on the images contained in the last videotape that is delivered to him and Renee (Patricia Arquette); during the first act, the most crucial line is the statement that he does not like cameras because he prefers to remember things in his own way - not necessarily the way they happened. ""This whole first section of the movie is how Fred remembers his life before being imprisoned, and it happens in the space of a second - after he is beaten in the face by the policeman who arrested him. Believing in the mysterious tapes that preceded the murder is his way of trying to convince himself that he did not do it - that the Mysterious Man (Robert Blake as a killer of women - ironic, huh?) Really did. The second part, less effective due to its lighter tone, is Madison\'s way of escaping the reality of the electric chair. The light above your cell glows and vibrates as presumably someone is running, which triggers your fantasy to escape, physically becoming another person. However, even in the life of this younger man, Renee returns (as a double ...?) And he is free to start a life with her without the memory of his marriage but learns the sordid truth about his life ... Mystery Man again appears, this time helping him commit the conscious murder of his ex-pimp - and allowing him to be filmed to convince himself that this murder (which Fred may have committed before the movie began) was right. But who the hell knows ... The plot? I mapped this movie after I saw it for the first time, and there are many doubles whose nature we, as spectators, can not trust as physical reality or mental projection. Each interpretation points to the other - like the Moebius track that Lynch claims the movie incorporates. It\'s more like a puzzle structured around themes, especially a subtext involving photography - the photo of the twins, the porn movies, the scary videos that show up on your doorstep as evil phone cards. Be sure to get a letterbox version of this movie; Lynch\'s visual compositions are based on horizontal angles all the time, and there are many extreme close-ups in which the tops of the heads are truncated (for some evil intent, I\'m sure). Cinematography is great, and the soundtrack (not the music, but the atmosphere that Lynch always does meticulously) is as important as the pictures, as in ""Eraserhead"". `` And after watching a particular scene in this movie, you will be very careful around glass tables with sharp edges for the rest of your life ...'",1
"b'Yes, my first copy had the audio problem, but the replacement worked well, so do not be afraid to buy this good introduction to a neglected horror star. In his highly theatrical mode, Tod Slaughter was as agreeable as Karloff or Lugosi, and, as some critics noted, no actor ever had so much fun being bad (with a capital B)! FACE is probably the best of it and BARN is the first; both movies are eminently viewable with good picture quality. So give the Horror Man a try in Europe; If you like scare movies from the 30s and 40s, you probably will not regret it. I, for example, expect to see more Slaughter on DVD.'",1

"b'By the time this album came out, the Spice Girls were everywhere. They were on all magazine covers, they were in lollipops, books, they still had several sets of dolls as well as 5 # 1 hit songs. This album only added to it and until today has sold more than 15 million copies worldwide. Face it, they have sold more records than anyone since the Beatles and no one has yet to sell more than the Spice Girls. They are a milestone in pop music, a legacy and without them, there would be Britney or Christina. Spice Up Your Life (10/10) Yet another # 1 hit for girls, this song has great lyrics. And it was a smart way to market them. I was impressed with the video, it\'s very good. Great song. Stop (10/10) The only song that did not hit # 1 in the UK. I love this one . Geri\'s vocals are, in my opinion, the best part of this song. She looks so sweet and perfect in her verses. Captivating lyrics ... a perfect pop song. Too Much (10/10) One of my all time favorite songs. Just as 2 become 1. I love the message and the story behind this. When you have it, it\'s too much ... when you do not, it\'s not enough. LARGE letter. Saturday Night Divas (10/10) Another favorite of mine. I love the Melanie C piece on the bridge. Your voice here surprises me. Emma\'s verses are also perfect. Beautiful music with original and different verses. Love ! 05 Never give up the good times (10/10) Many fans agree that this would be a great single. This is great song with a great message for everyone. Especially for the girls. Be safe and do not get pregnant ... live young as long as you can. Move Over (8/10) Pepsi\'s music, but it\'s great overall. It\'s a kind of filler on this album, but its smooth rhythm and raw vocals make up for it. Although I prefer the other Pepsi song, ""Step To Me,"" about that. It is available in the Japanese version of this album. Do It (9/10) Another song with a great message! My mom did not find out when the first album came out, but I agreed with everything they\'re saying and I still do. `` The rules should be broken, do what suites you, not what they want you to do. \'\' 08. Denying (10/10) Reminds me of my ex-boyfriend denying that he was really gay. This is one of my favorites. ""You do not fool anyone but yourself. \'\' So true. Live Forever (10/10) Beautiful! Beautiful lyrics and melody. Saying goodbye to true love ... I can relate to it more deeply than many other songs here. This song really gives me shivers, it\'s amazing music. One of his best. The Lady Is A Vamp (7/10) Not one of my favorites, but it\'s different. And it\'s a great way to end the album as a concert ... ""Ladies and gentlemen, we hope you enjoyed the show! ""Overall, this album is as good as the original, with as much seasoning as the previous one. Geri, Emma, \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bMel C, Mel B and Victoria all have equal vocals in this one and they all sound incredible, however.

When she and Domingo were singing in the third act, it was magic. When she was shedding tears as she sang my heart palpitated to a renewed passion of why I loved Opera to begin with. My eyes and ears were glued to my home theater. For all I care, Marton and Domingo could have broken their voices and that would not have mattered to me a bit because people were lined up about the Met that night.

Many of the title cards are so dark that they are unreadable; It would certainly have been a simple matter to create new titles for this release - unless the Grapevine folks could not read them either. The contrast in a section of the movie is so high that the characters and objects are reduced to blank blobs on the screen. I completely agree with the other critic's comments on the film's acting and film qualities of 1922.

No, I say, I do not deny the possibility of a higher being. But I deny the church. This story clearly shows how organized religion has routinely destroyed the best messages but corrupting them with greed, desire for power, and cruelty. Groups of men made human choices and wrote human words to describe a system that would keep them in power, and that story goes deeper into that. He investigates the little-known facts about the so-called ""holy"" Bible ... the idea that what we now know as the Bible differed greatly from what it once was. And so on . I do not seek to destroy faith, nor this history. What it does is, hopefully, entice the viewer / reader to think for himself.

"b'I\'ve never written a review before, but after trying this video I felt compelled to warn others about how the title of the video is misleading. This video is very intense for anyone with neck or shoulder pain. I have a lot of pain in the neck and shoulders and this video only gets worse. Anyone with severe muscle tension needs yoga with a lot of stretching for those tight areas - this video is not it! The video starts with push ups and various weight poses, putting a lot of stress on the neck and shoulders (like plank and dog down). This is a very fast video - it\'s more a flow of yoga, definitely not something that will ""rescue your neck and shoulders""! ! ! ! ! It alternates between weight poses and very, very quickly and there is almost no stretching in this video! She does not explain the poses and moves too fast. This video is for advanced yogis and definitely not for beginners or for anyone who has any kind of pain. I\'m not a beginner, but I have a lot of neck / shoulder pain and this video is completely inappropriate. There are other reasons also because this video is annoying (but these are of much lesser importance): the song is annoying. of voodoo music), the background scene is nauseating and it is very false. If you\'re looking for a good neck and shoulder support video, try ""Yoga for Stress Relief"" with Barbara Benagh, it\'s great!

"b'Every year, when Christmas rolls around, I like to have some friends to enjoy a cup of joy (a potent Egg Nog recipe available on request), put on a nice Christmas song, light some candles, prepare some delicious and golden, and gather around my humble but enough cinema and watch a wonderful holiday favorite. This year I\'m going to watch Die Hard and for me Christmas would not be complete without it. John McTiernan\'s classic action (Predator and The Hunt for Red October) that has spawned three explosive sequels never seems to age. , no matter how dated the hair, clothes and portrait of California cocaine addicts. Die Hard follows John McClane (Bruce Willis) to his quasi-wife\'s Christmas party (Bonnie Bedelia) in a skyscraper on the west coast. He is a New York cop whose wife and children have moved west while she seizes a great opportunity and fits. Of course, they are having some wedding problems but it is underestimated just enough. The building is empty except for the group that is having the Christmas party on one of the higher floors. ""Terrorists"" led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) take over the building and chaos sets in. Gruber\'s plan would have worked very well if John had not fled and slowly began to take out each of his minions while warning local authorities. The feds soon arrive and the movie explodes in an action classic ... and also a Christmas classic. He has such a nice and compelling hero as you can get into John McClane and Bruce Willis behind the scenes of all the other action heroes making John not only clever and entertaining but easy to relate to with very little drama. It\'s an effortless performance that I can only compare to Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. Just little fearless remarks, coupled with a cynical look on his face, make John go from typical good boy to what every kid dreams they could become under these circumstances. It\'s fantastic and it\'s kitsch, but this is forgivable because it\'s a holiday movie and even more importantly, action is still the priority at Die Hard. On the other side of the coin, the grandeur of Die Hard is complete. by his formidable and accessible antagonist, Hans Gruber. Even after we discover that Hans is not there as a political terrorist, but simply as a thief, he does not lose any credibility when he responds to Holly McClane\'s criticism by saying, ""I am an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane and since I am I am moving to kidnap you, you should be more educated.Although we know that Hans is capable of devious acts, he views them as merely means to a greater and somehow justifiable purpose.Your disposition is almost humanitarian and you could imagine it as a gentleman out of the context of the crimes he committed in the arch of the Duro de Matar.In the end, however, Hans is a pure sociopath who even the public is led to sympathize with.I wanted him to escape if his opposition was Van Damme , Segal or Stallone ... maybe even Arnold .The supporting cast is another great force and it helps to highlight the humorous tone of the film.The cops and feds are all fun and rich characters, especially Reggie VelJohnson as Sgt. Al-Powell. Villains are purely chaotic thugs with enough variety to make them a little more than just John\'s body count. The performance of William Atherton as a reporter is also noteworthy, as is John\'s limousine driver, Argyle. Even the edited versions for television are worth it when the curse is replaced by wonderfully light little curses like * slug of the ditch *, * melon farmer * and * bad mother crusher *. These, of course, make it fun and affordable for all ages and Die Hard is one of the best examples of hilariously edited television movies. But that\'s not clear what makes it a great movie. I would actually say that Die Hard is the biggest pure action movie ever made. Yippie-ki-yay * muddy funster * ... and happy holidays.'",1
"b'Putting in my two cents: The girl who went through time was on my watch list for a while, but I never had time to check until yesterday. I (like most of the other reviewers) was not expecting much, but after seeing his new movie ""Summer Wars"" I decided to give it a try. I have to say that despite being a slightly older film, it overcomes the Summer Wars in almost every respect (except perhaps computer animation). There is literally no weakness in this movie. The quality of the animation remains high throughout. The characters are beautifully drawn by hand and the backgrounds are meticulously rendered (mostly hand-drawn as well). The use of computer animation is kept to a minimum and occurs mainly when we see a \'jump\'. The characters are strong and nice. Makoto is his typical awkward teenager. A chance encounter followed by an (almost) horrible accident allows her to ""jump"" in time. Instead of using this ability for the so-called \'evil\' (I would be jumping back and investing heavily in certain actions ...), Makoto uses the ability to improve her life and that of her friends. However, this begins to cause unforeseen and terrible circumstances. And that\'s about the point where the film changes from light and somewhat comical to totally dramatic and overwhelming. I do not divulge any event or damage any plot for you, but let\'s say I was moved by the end of the movie (though not with tears in the eyes!). The dubbing in Japanese is strong, especially considering at least 2/3 of the main characters are dubbed by a first voice actor. It shows how in Japan they take the voice seriously and make a good cast (instead of most American dubbing companies that have a core of 5 or 6 full-time actors that need to match a main character in each series. film - often not getting the best game for the character). So the story is strong with a bit of science fiction, the characters are nice and well portrayed, the dubbing is wonderful, the animation is beautiful ... why Have not you seen it yet? If you are not an anime fan, this might be a good movie to help change your mind.'",1

Add 15 minutes of filming new badly filmed with terrifyingly bad acting, writing and directing. Pour out the original soundtrack and replace it with a painfully amateur electronic dubbing. Add insult to injury by misleading marketing as the definitive 30th anniversary edition. Words can not express how terrible this edition is. Really, this is bad. I've seen student films and amateur fan editions done better. The new footage is so poorly written and acted it would be almost funny if it were not cut in this classic movie.

"b'This is an oddity - a supernatural, low-budget western with a good cast, an eye for winter landscapes, and, most notably, a genuinely scary atmosphere. Sadly, the direction and editing are regrettable, particularly in the earlier Civil War battles, and after the long ascent of the Demon Mountain, there is a real sense of anti-climax. The journey is not helped by this version of Synergy DVD, which is technically laughable, a devious video recording transferred to the digital medium with the high degree of degradation of sound and image. To make matters worse, the holes in which the ""bad"" language was excised and, even more damaging, blood and blood were less than surgically removed, which may explain why this version lasts 90 minutes while the original print is from 114.'",0

"b'What I loved the most about this movie is the lack of & quot; message & quot; or schedule. Another then telling a great story this movie had nothing to do & quot; prove & quot; . There were no tearful speeches for the AIDS victims, no anguish about the pain of coming out, just great characters engaged in a funny out-of-the-ordinary script (with dialouge as good as any other by Neal Simon) that works. There are many complicated plot elements that come together very well and this is not easy to do. The way the writer connects the main characters strive to finish his song with the rest of the plot is brilliant. I also disagree with criticism from a previous writer who stated that the two characters had no chemistry and would never be together in & quot; reality & quot; . One can see from the admirable performance of J.P. Pitoks that the character was more than a simple steak. In fact, I thought they made a real couple really cute not in spite of, but because of their differences. The final scene of them walking down the street said everything ... Gabriel could not keep his mouth shut and Mark could not speak. But we laughed in the right places. A great movie. The fact that it does not & quot; message & quot; it is necessary to show that the gay community may be starting to feel more accepted.'",1

His incredible tip, his instructions and the exercises work wonderfully well. This video is no exception. Working the enire's body, Karen focuses on specific areas, but keeps the entire body moving throughout the video. Although the background is a bit dated, as well as the flowery leotards, the workout is not.

My experience has been that high definition mastered DVDs look identical to the Blu-ray version (on both a Blu-Ray player and an upconvert DVD player). Ultraviolet is no exception. In addition, the film's appearance seems to soften the details, which really knocks the Blu-ray point off. In addition to not improving the appearance, the Blu-ray version has no more special features than the DVD, and the DVD cut extended seven additional minutes. Go with the DVD version in this.""",0

"b""The classic tale of demonic possession of all time, based on William Peter Blatty's bestseller. Linda Blair is Regan MacNeil, a twelve-year-old girl who manifests herself in a truly evil spirit. His mother, Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), an agnostic, seeks the help of a young Jesuit psychiatrist, Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller, God rest his Irish soul!) Who has his own demons, and is plagued by his recent death. of his mother, and his loss in faith that he sought refuge. After confronting the demon within the girl (and himself), Karras, though skeptical of demonic possession, is given permission from the church to assist during the exorcism. The priest chosen to perform the ritual is a mysterious and elderly Jesuit, Father Lankaster Merrin (Max Von Sydow), who has seen such devilish work. While the two clerics confront the devil, a police detective, Lieutenant William F. Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb) finds some links connecting the girl with a cryptic death and desecration in the local Catholic church. William Friedkin brilliantly directed, and Blatty adapted the script (receiving an Oscar for his efforts) and produced. The cast gives extraordinary and sensitive performances (Burstyn, Miller and Blair all nominated for the Oscars) and the special effects are breathtaking and still bring a punch, with veteran Mercedes McCambridge providing the voice of the evil entity. (The movie also won for Best Achievement in Sound). The underlying theme of much of Blatty's work is self-evident, his philosophy being, if there is all this evil out there, why is there so much good? Metaphorically, everyone fights their own demons, and even in their last moment of self-sacrifice, Karras finds his faith again and heroically gives his life to save this innocent child. How much more significant can it be? A truly terrifying, captivating, and ultimately moving, film that deals with human faith and frailty.""",1

"b""This story caught my eye immediately and kept it all through the movie. The film is based on the life of John Nash. He was a brilliant mathematician who became famous as a young man for his work in economics. The film spans several decades and begins when John Nash arrives at Princeton University. Russell Crowe does an excellent job in the role of Nash. The part demanded Nash's transformation from a healthy young man to an aged schizophrenic. Alicia, Nash's wife is played by Jennifer Connelly. She is very convincing as a smart and strong woman who comes to realize that her brilliant husband is very upset and lives in another world. A particularly lovely scene stands out in my mind, where Nash and his future wife are staring at the stars. He tells her to think of different shapes or animals and he is able to look at the night sky with its millions of stars, and link them in whatever form she mentions. I wish there were more such scenes and maybe a little insight into Nash's family and childhood. John Nash was finally awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, which is a consolation, but the tragedy of his talented mind is being assaulted by delusions was something I do not forget. I came out of this movie with tremendous compassion for John Nash. Schizophrenia is really a horrible mental illness. This movie is worth seeing and I believe it will stand the test of time.""",1

"b'I felt compelled to write a review of this movie for several reasons. Firstly, because this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I never get tired of watching this movie several times and sharing with others who have not yet had the pleasure of watching it. I also wanted to write this review because many younger movie fans immediately discard old movies and especially black and white movies. And finally, I wanted to put my two cents after reading the critical `` professional criticism \'\' ... mis-cast? ? ? How could there be a more perfect and better movie? ? ? Gregory Peck, whom I came to revere as Atticus Finch in `` To Kill A Mockingbird \'\' (he is the reason why I wanted to become a lawyer when I was a child), and Audrey Hepburn has the perfect blend of innocence and fearlessness for his role as the rebel princess. Even Eddie Albert as the comedy kick was ideal. This film follows a princess who, at first glance, lives an enviable life of wealth and fame and glamor. I\'ve always found it hard to find any sympathy for similar people\'s complaints, either in real life or in the movie, but somehow Audrey Hepburn does it and it\'s not hard to cheer her up because she experiences such basic things as deciding how her hair should look be cut and eat an ice cream. While Gregory Peck is undeniably suave as the American journalist, he is also able to remove the weakness necessary to make his paper acceptable. You have to be able to understand that your initial motivation does NOT come from a ""good place"", but merely from greed and selfishness. but then you also have to believe in your change of heart and your subtlety. And this works. He does not wake up suddenly and has a change of heart. You can see its transformation or relevancy in the course of the movie. As a romantic closet I have to say that I always secretly hope there is a better ending (and by ""better"" I do not mean in terms of movie quality. I mean in terms of a classic ""happy ending""). The final scene is to cut the heart, but the only plausible way it can end. I\'m always wondering what happened next, even though I know the answer very well ... and it\'s not necessarily what we\'d all like to imagine. But I respect the fact that the film does not spell it and does not involve everything in a lovely bow. Still a sad ending, but exactly as it should be. Please watch this movie. You\'ll want to own it later, I promise. And do not be fooled, it\'s not just an old-fashioned movie. \'\' It\'s just good. Oh yes, and that * sigh factor * ... HUGE! Enjoy and share with the younger crowd, so this classic is never lost to modern blockbusters.'",1

"b'I must agree with the reviewers who say that the production of this concert footage is very poor. If you are looking to watch Evanescence live, chances are you will not find it here. This looks more like any video clip than a show. It has been edited to a nth degree and rarely focuses on a single shot for more than two seconds. Fortunately, the DVD has a few redeeming factors, including the exciting videos from ""Bring Me to Life,"" ""Going Under,"" ""My Immortal,"" and ""Everybody\'s Fool."" The backstage bits are a little bit fun, if nothing else. It is good to be shown that this band has a lot of fun on the road, giving the impression that they will not leave the business anytime soon. While the video aspect of the DVD is poorly done, the audio is much better, which is why, if it were possible, I recommend you buy the concert CD instead of the DVD. Anyway, Amy\'s voice is pretty familiar in concert, which I was not sure; Do you know how some singers sound completely different live than on a recording? Well, she does not. Her voice falters during some of the fast-paced songs, but this is expected when she is running and jumping on stage. I was particularly impressed with the ballads; his powerful vocals combined with his beautiful piano playing were chilling, especially during Breathe No More and the band\'s hit My Immortal. I was surprised to find that I really liked `` Thoughtless \'\', the band\'s cover of a KoRn song. I\'ve never been a KoRn person, or an alternative rock heavy metal person of any kind, but I was impressed by how this song was performed by Evanescence. The audio CD also includes an unreleased track called `` Absence of \'\'. Much like the other ballads of the band, this song is smooth, with good vocals and painful and beautiful lyrics. In conclusion, Evanescence sounds very, very good on this CD. It is a real pleasure to hear; it\'s just the DVD that, well, sucks.'",1

"b""After his son is implicated in the murder of his girlfriend, parents Streep and Neeson disagree on the course of action to be followed.

The slogan of how far would you be? go protect your own flesh and blood promises much more than surrender. In fact, he can never increase the tension, even in scenes that by right should be the most interesting of the film, as the revelation of what really happened between Furlong and his girlfriend. All performances are intact and correct; this is exactly the kind of paper that best fits Streep (even though she was much nicer in 'The Wild River'), Neeson is equally very good in a role, unfortunately, stereotyped and although Furlong is often typecast as the troublesome teenager He plays better than anyone else. However, the main flaw is that something that promises excitement never reaches the boiling point and despite the names of the stars you can not help but think everything looks a lot like a TV movie.

Not only was it great action for the TV-Y7 rating, but the plot was very mature and resembled a Toonami-style drama with some breathtaking and thrilling moments, and this made this series be awesome. It may be the best Marvel cartoon ever made. It is disappointing that this show does not have a second season, hence the name `` The Complete Series '' instead of `` The Complete 1st Season '' as it should have been. I just hope that in the future, we'll know what happens after the series end.""",1
"b""The miracle worker is an impressive account of the life of Jesus here on earth. Forget the description of Jesus' editorial comments as shocking (do not think they watched the movie) Jesus is portrayed by Ralph Fiennes as he lived. He was happy with the message he had to share! This movie does that. It also shows how Jesus was human, how he struggled with the very things we fought. That was the main point of God to send him here and this movie really captures him. My son & amp; her husband also loved it. It is more biblically accurate than any other account of the life of Jesus I have ever seen, including the greatest story ever told.""",1
"b""Long ago, a caretaker named Cropsy was horribly burned by a bad joke that went wrong leaving him disfigured. Five years later, he returns to the same camp where he worked and now seeks revenge with a huge pair of scissors that he uses to cut his victims to pieces, but can campers survive the vacation in hell? Fun and bloody for the max slasher movie that is one of the most neglected horror movies ever! The makeup effects of Tom Savini are impressive even by today's standards, as I think he is the master of all make-up artists. The film is co-starring Holly Hunter and Jason Alexander prior to their major film careers, there is an incredible graphic violence, such as the infamous sequence of rampage massacre with more of the blood that was cropped and restored on this DVD. The score is also pretty scary, not for the faint of heart, but should be for fans of Sleepaway Camp and Friday the 13th. The DVD has some nice extras like two featurettes. especially on the makeup effects of Tom Savini, photo gallery and a trailer.""",1

"b""& quot; Return of the Living Dead & quot; is a hilarious horror / comedy inspired by the classic George A. Romero & quot; Live dead & quot; movies. I saw this movie when I was just a small child and I loved it. This is as much like Camp 80 as horror movies. The premise of the film is a good tribute to Romero. Apparently, the movie & quot; Night of the Living Dead & quot; was based on a true story, and was overruled by the US government. The bodies of the zombies were sealed in scattered oil drums. Two workers at a medical supply depot find one of these drums, drill the accident and release a gas that brings the dead close to life. Luckily, the warehouse is right next to a graveyard. The rest is written, and the movie has some of the funniest moments in horror movie history: A corpse running in the warehouse, a zombie head being thrown out of the park with a baseball bat, a zombie ordering & quot; more paramedics & quot; like he's asking for pizza. And above all, a hard rock soundtrack from the '80s. This is one of my favorite party movies because it makes everyone (even non-terror fans) howl. It's a bit bloody, but comedy dazzles the elements of terror. The DVD in question is a bit light on the extras except for a documentary that is fun but warm. But the great privilege is the best picture and sound quality I've ever seen in this movie. The DVD really makes a difference. Grab a copy and see what I mean, you will not regret it.""",1

"b""Since this movie is sold out, it took me a few weeks to locate a copy. However, once I did, it seemed that I had found the holy grail of the horror film. The story revolves around a scandalous case had for a bored housewife (Julia Cotton) and her brother-in-law (Frank Cotton). Julia and her husband move to Frank's former home after Frank's sudden disappearance. Of course, Frank did not really disappear. Instead, the pervert brother-in-law has found a cube-shaped puzzle. The puzzle, when opened, opens a portal to the world of Cenobites. The Cenobites offer the greatest pleasure, but at a high cost. To escape the world of the Cenobites, once a drop of his brother's blood has been spilled on the floor of the house, Frank returns as a walking corpse, needing body parts. of living beings to be completed again. Frank uses his previous relationship with Julia to persuade her to bring him new victims. With each victim, Frank becomes more complete, but also more impatient. There are several prefigurations, praises the mantis with Julia when she goes to bars and picks random men for slaughter. Of course, eventually her actions bring suspicion on her stepdaughter and her husband ... The film introduces the introduction of Cenobites, which are some of the scariest cats in horror since the Alien Xenomorphs. As the movie progresses, we learn more about these beings, their origin and purpose. Of course, the ending leaves everything open, which leads to several sequences. I highly recommend this movie to those who enjoy watching old horror movies made by those who are now considered masters of the genre.""",1
"b'For the big fans of Manhunter, I advise you to avoid this DVD if you plan to own ... What was advertised as & quot; Theatrical & quot; version is actually a poorly mended version that awkwardly edits two scenes that had been in the theatrical version, including one of the most crucial scenes, and still has in it some of the most banal scenes restored from the cutting room floor. These cuts are poorly made and do not make sense to them, since they do not represent the theatrical release and destroy what was a finely edited film. I do not know if it was ignorance or arrogance, but this is the worst hacker job I\'ve ever seen trying to get by product. Whoever was in charge at Anchor Bay was an idiot, and if I were Michael Mann, I would call my lawyers. & Quot; Director\'s Cut & quot; is even worse in that it includes & quot; Non-Theatrical & quot; launch and so-called & quot; Director\'s Cut & quot; - a compilation of some interesting and not so interesting takes. As a companion to a true theatrical release, this would have been a fascinating addition; But here again, Anchor Bay finds a way to ruin what should be a good product. The entire film that has not gone through video post-production is stained and foggy, as if it had been transferred from a VHS tape - and a worn tape. ""It\'s simply amazing that someone might have the audacity to offer this kind of price for the hard earned money. I saw this movie when it first came out in the movies and considered it one of the best of that year; and I ran to buy the LaserDisc version when it came out. When DVD Director\'s Cut was released by Anchor Bay this year, I was on the waiting list - ready to receive the enhanced THX widescreen version. Being intimately aware of the film, imagine my disappointment. Do not waste your time. Wait for a better version to leave. As for those people who want to compare the Silence of the Lambs to Manhunter, they usually favor one over the other and their minds are very well made right now. I\'m good at the Hunters\' Camp. For me, I liked Silence, but I could never take it seriously since I found Reader\'s portayal both caricaturedly superhuman and therefore unreal and unsuspended. However, Manhunter\'s Reader is a creepy but more realistic portrait that surprises me every time I see this in how an evil genius manages to manipulate events out of his cell through the simple apparatus of a telephone. This Reader is surely behind steralized bars - and yet it manages to be a strong presence for TBE told with.I hope every fan and future fan of Manhunter gets to see it the way it first appeared, a beautiful piece of handicraft which was slim and elegant, and yet it flowed elegantly. Siskel and Ebert rated it as one of the best films of all time, years after he left. But for now, I\'ll hold my LaserDisc.'",0
"b""I saw and loved all three of those movies, so I did not roll to read the reviews. I should have .

"b""All 3 movies are well seated at the tip of your seat, but most people already know the story lines. The first of three films, The Bourne Identity, has excellent video and very discreet audio channel tracking. The sound mixers did a great job of using all the surround channels and did not let the soundtrack hide the various foley effects on any of the front or rear channels. Of course, in all the excitement, your subwoofer will have a good workout. The video transfer is very good with no video noise, aliasing or artifacts. This movie started the whole franchise and was a super start. My only question was how Bourne being shot in the back brought his amnesia in the first place. This was never really answered, since amnesia usually originated from severe head trauma and not from two bullets in the back. The Bourne Supremacy, the second film in the trilogy, made much more use of the portable camera, and while that was happening, it did not bother me, I remember a friend and professional photographer mentioning that he got seasick. The video transfer on Blu-ray was excellent in all respects, but I also noticed much less use of directional audio. Rather than putting money into a more understated sound editing, the producers augmented the soundtrack that enveloped the entire sound stage, front and back. It's not that the soundtrack does not fit the film, it certainly does, and it creates the excitement that the Bourne movie requires, but a greater focus on the 5.1 sound stage for foley purposes would have been good. The last of the Trilogy, the Bourne Ultimatum, completes the pack with the same force in the video transfer. I did not see any weakness in any of the video downloads for the 3 movies, but again, in the Bourne Ultimatum, you'd think with all the excitement going on, that using the front and back sides would be more prominent. I was disappointed that, like the Bourne Supremacy, they simply increased the audio levels of the soundtrack that would obfuscate any foley effects. I'm not saying that there is no use of discrete in either of the last two movies, but not where as much as what might have been or how it was used in the first Bourne Identity. To save $, they just raise the soundtrack level and that's a shame. During the fight scene, there are things being played, glass breaking and all sorts of chaos that could easily have been directed left or right, forward or backward. So, in this respect, I was disappointed. Nevertheless, this is a great collection to have, and the excitement and rhythm of the three films is simply outstanding. There are many deleted scenes and other short 'making of' scenes, as well as comments, with no wasted space for previews and announcements from other films. It's worth the cost. I hope this review has been helpful and if so, please check the 'Helpful' button so I know I'm on the right path with my reviews for you. Thank you .""",1
"b'Every once in a while a film comes up that has had almost no publicity, not even a decent release for the general public, but the purgatory of limited films and art films. However, in the case of Equilibrium, I am more impressed that it has never received a wider release. Upon seeing the film, I honestly did not have high expectations, other than seeing some cool shootings and martial arts as the star of the movie. Although this factor has been fun, the real star belongs to the finely crafted script that honors such novels as ""Brave New World"", ""1984"" and ""Fahrenheit 451"". History puts the viewer in the post-apocalyptic world of the future. Having suffered the consequences of World War III, the survivors were banished together to form a new society that would rid them of humanity\'s greatest faults and emotions. Controlled by a drug that nullifies such meanings, the future is a war-free utopia, but enslaved by those who hold power and the created establishment. Art, music, literature, all this is forbidden and the penalty for committing such mental crimes is death. The most feared of the establishment guards is the Cleric. A group of men trained in mind and body to be the perfect killing machines and the hindquarters of their ideals. One such cleric, who even executed his own partner to read a book of poems, begins to see the world in a new light when he loses his regular dose and experiences a barrage of emotions he had never felt before. In attempting to maintain his duty, he finds the cruel sadism of his assigned task almost more than he can bear. In a desperate search, he tries to find resistance and put an end to the madness he has safeguarded. Christian Bale, playing the Cleric, is incredible giving depth and excitement to a role that required none. In this he makes the film even deeper. Film style and editing, borrowed from filmmakers like John Woo and Tsui Hark, bring enough freshness while adapting these styles. The art direction fits into creating a claustrophobic world of dark lies. Although the city scenarios are not so impressive and are obviously CG effects. Music that is sometimes obscure and tied to a conflict of foreboding and then is a fast-paced techno that sets the pace of the shooting without losing the rhythm. In all Equilibrium is a dream of science fiction fans, but it is also a movie that can be enjoyed by fans of classical literature as well. While the ending may seem simplified, I actually found it to have a deeper meaning as well as an interesting commentary on mankind in general. But most will be thrilled by the ten-minute shootout with an impressive sword duel. Balance contains strong violence and language and is recommended for people over 17 years. For once the style and substance collide on the celluloid.'",1
"b""I can not rave about this DVD anymore! ! ! ! I think they did the best they could with incorporating music with phonetics. I swear, my 6-year-old son in first grade has had a dramatic improvement in reading and spelling after watching this video. At the beginning of the school year, she had an average of 3 out of 8 on her spelling and her first report card, the teacher said she needed more help with reading. I called this video a few times during the week for a few weeks for her to watch and every time I started in a different chapter. There was a dramatic improvement in his reading and spelling. Now she got an 8/8 in her spelling. She started coming home with stickers every day from school, which she said she managed to do a good job of reading. She said that this phonic video taught her to read! ! ! Just a few weeks ago, we were barely going through Dora's phonetics series and now she's reading books for me that she picked up in the library that are on a second level. Awesome video! ! ! !

"b""This is one of the films most loved by the affictionados of the scene of the foreign cinema. Tati provided a brilliant connection between the better than the silent film era and modern cinema had to offer. It is a relatively simple tale of a clumsy man on vacation off the coast of France. But repeated visions, especially over the years, increasingly open up treasures that have not been recognized until now, like a classic novel. I'd be surprised if anyone gets excited about this movie the first time they watch it. I certainly did not. But repeated views over the years will give you an appreciation of this cult-serving film. Every member of my extended family loves this movie, and everyone has a particular reason. Some love their ability to perfectly capture a foreign time and place, allowing them to feel as if they themselves had escaped to the French coast during the afternoon. Some adore Hulot's awkward but enjoyable attempts at the best novel. Many love the bright jokes that are funny, no matter how many times you've seen them. But regardless of what the viewer loves most, everyone will feel a bond with the character of Hulot (and, in turn, M. Tati), who will last a lifetime. With this DVD, I can finally feel safe to borrow my beloved and grainy copy on VHS. A classic film by all the meanings of the term.""",1
"b""When I was ten years old, my mother's uncle gave me his copy of Cornelius Ryan's book A Bridge Too Far. This was a very special gift from him since he was deported to Germany to work for the Reich during World War II and never mentally recovered from what had happened to him. By the time I got the book, he lived in a small village a few miles west of Arnhem on the south bank of the River Rijn. Obviously, I was young to read the book back then. Over the years, my interest in World War II and Operation Market Garden began to grow, and every time A Bridge Too Far was broadcast, I watched. The scenes depicting the parachute falls and the Waal River assault were the most remembered. That, and the great musical score of John Addison. I finally bought the DVD and watched it a few times since. I must say that every time I watch, the movie gets better and better. Especially with subtitles: first those that specify where we are. Without this, it can be confused where the viewer was brought from one scene to another. Secondly, since English is not my native language, I have been able to better understand some of the dialogues. (Finally I understood what Liv was trying to say in Dutch =) The widescreen option is fantastic. You actually enter the battle scenes and see all the extra images ... for example, when John Frost's battalion is entering Arnhem, you see people riding a bicycle in the background, you do not see in the pan and But with a great like the DVD, and also with the 25th anniversary of the movies last year, MGM and United Artists missed a big chance. It's a shame that the only extra is the original theatrical trailer. I would really like to see more behind the scene images included in a second disc. The Dutch Broadcasting Company (NOS) must have a lot of filming, I remember the news often spending time filming the film, such as re-enacted excrement. Also, the studio should have extra pictures as well. They could even produce a new documantary in the filming of this film, including interviews with leading actors and Sir Richard Attenborough. What about the original footage and notes about the battle how it happened? Despite this lack, it is still a must buy if you are into war and / or classic movies. After 25 years, it still holds its own, and it's still a thrill to watch. Buy it, and meanwhile keep waiting for a special DVD edition. I give this DVD 4 stars, but if they had included the extra stuff, it would easily get 5 stars!""",1

So when I settled in to watch the movie, my heart broke. Someone, in his infinite wisdom, has decided to censor almost all nudity, and many other scenes have either been shortened, or are entirely lacking. I suppose this version of the movie may seem a bit more complex because the missing scenes may have slowed down the movie a bit, but the most recent scenes were all PRICELESS. The ineptitude of this film is what made it special, and editing it as ""professional version"" is a limited blasphemy. After seeing this edited and censored version, I wish I had never bought it.

"b'I am just writing this review so this movie does not have the regrettably misleading 3-star rating of the only other reviewer. There are a handful of truly great Vietnam war films, and they usually cover their own solo. Full Metal Jacket is a kind of exception in that it covers the other three all do separately. Platoon covers the real combat, the sensation of hell that produced in an individual experiencing the fight, the jungle, the trauma at the moment the O deer hunter covers the post-war trauma, the long-range effect on a veteran\'s psyche. Apocalypse Now covers the psychological (and poetic) heart of war, that is, the heart of what war means, which is hate, fear and the merciless nature of the universe. After all, it\'s based on \'Heart of Darkness\'. Overall, it may be the most terrifying and irresistible of all. In turn, Heart of Darkness and this film are based on a long line of literary background called ""katabasis"" in Greek, that is, the descent into the underworld. It is epic, punctuated by scene after scene that becomes somber and distorted, and the protagonist is self-compelled, advancing to hell without knowing why - because, as evil exists, he feels attracted to him, or if he can not, become part of it. Transitively, ask him to try to understand the evil. If I no longer owned this, I would definitely buy it instantly for $ 6, as anyone who sees this page and has not seen the movie should do.'",1
"b""I never got a chance to go see this movie when it hit the theaters. I rented it without knowing what to expect. After watching it on DVD, I can say that I would not have minded paying the price of the movie ticket to watch this movie. It's not all that glamorous, but what a good and respectable good movie. Gabrielle Union does a good job of playing a rude, hateful, hateful sister by the name of Eva. Sometimes she takes it to the top, but that's acting and that's what she's paid to do. Eva is keen to take care of her little sister, who leans to her for advice instead of her men. Sister Eva love and hear her as if her word was the gospel. Men, on the other hand, hate their courage and want nothing more than to see her leave town. She often interferes with her sisters' relationships and insists on leaving the men of her sisters crazy. Thus, in order to bring the proper order to their respected relationships, men plan to take Eve out of their lives. So, the need for Ray (LL Cool J). Ray is a soft-spoken player with a serious game. The men tell Ray to date Eve to get her out of their lives. Ray agrees, and so the story begins with two people falling in love with each other who should not fall in love. That's when things get confusing for Ray and Eva. Some parts of the movie were a bit outrageous and the ending was not the best, but after all, it was a really good movie. I read some of the comments about this movie and other movies as well. My thing is, if you want real life situations, go watch a drama or a real life story. This is comedy ... the comedy should not be real. It is really an escape from reality. Do not we all need it now? Anyway, in addition to the ending, this movie was well done with the supporting actors doing a great job in playing their respected roles. Also, the women in this movie are fine. Also, LL did a great job playing Ray. I have a lot of respect for him as an actor. He did not play his part anymore, but he made that believable. All in all, I give this movie a B +. The ending was a little clich\xc3\xa9.""",1

The cast is quite ineffective too, with Robert Carradine making an impression of Jack Nicholson, Nicholas Bell being properly British and boring and Stacy Haiduk trying to exude sexuality but not accomplishing it. The subplot involves, what else, a group of foolish college students who choose this resort location as a hunt for new promises.

What makes this movie so amazing is how it is able to present this window to the lives of this group of people with such acumen and insight, sadness and honesty; ultimately resulting in a film that is tender and uplifting and hopeful. The acting is simply incredible. No other words to put. Everyone from Brenda Blethyn to Timothy Spall to Marianna Jean Baptiste to Claire Rushbrook all take turns in robbery scenes in such natural performances and to the point that sometimes it does not even seem like they're acting. This is the true performance that cuts right to the heart. The screenplay is wonderful as it provides so many little details that no one would think of including in a movie. Just the smallest things that somehow bring the characters to life. A wonderful movie that will never be acclaimed because that's all about the actors. No special effects or sex scenes. No way - this is an actor's movie. And they steal the show. If you have taste in REAL cinema, do not miss this gem of a movie. IT IS SIMPLY WONDERFUL.""",1
"b'As other reviewers have said, I was eager to watch an authentic adaptation of H.G. Wells\'s classic Romance. At the same time, I was aware that this film was made on a modest budget with the expected results. Well, this movie was worse than I expected. The special effects seemed quite caricatured, especially compared to the state of the art (Spielberg). Worse, the use of colored filters in many scenes came to be extremely annoying after some time. Even the overall quality of the print was, at best, mediocre, with saturated color and only sharpness. And the acting receives no Oscar nomination. Also, I\'m wondering if the original 3-hour version would be better for watching the storywise. In this 125 minute version, there are many jumps from one subframe to another without proper scene development in my opinion. The Martian ""red weed"" appears briefly in some scenes without any explanation. On the plus side, I thought the tripods and manipulation machines looked really cool, the sound effects are very good, and the music score is beautiful. Unfortunately, this is not enough to overcome the poorly executed production. If only CGI were the state of the art and color filters were eliminated, it would be a good movie, but not great. If only ... ..'",0

"b""G.D really is almost perfect. I never get tired of it. At the same time, I think most people miss the point. (By the way, I have not seen the special edition.) I'm fascinated every time watching the totally self-centered Bill Murray captured in this wonderful time paradox, living the same day over and over. It goes through different phases: fear and confusion; euphoria, when he realizes that he can do anything without consequence; despair, when he realizes that life has no meaning if the person pursues selfish pleasures without goals; and finally a peaceful self-realization when he engages in self-improvement and the humanitarian goals that his situation gives him the opportunity to pursue. It takes a pause to consider what each would do in a similar circumstance. Oh, it's really funny, too.""",1
"b""1) If you want to see a loose creature in a museum rent relic. Whatever your thoughts on Relic, it was 100 times better than the first 30 minutes of this movie2) I really like Christian Slater but I really hope he does not do more work on a low budget and spoils his career 3) Tara Reid does not can act ! Either that, or the director and / or script was so stupid that it made her look bad. 4) I think what has improved for me was this attractive woman with her baseball cap back (what is it ?!) and makeup done and she specializes in communication to some secret government agency (no dress code?). She remains beautiful and trying to look tough as she presses buttons and gives updates to Stephen Dorff when he can see for himself what's going on. Really dumb! ! 5) The director can not create a suspicious scene for his life. They relied too much on special effects and less on finding a better director. Overall: not worth renting. Even if you're a fan of Slater / Reid / Dorff do not do it! !""",0
"b'Pull and pull, is she playing twins again? We do not need a remake of The Parent Trap, and we need it even less. I do not care if the guy has tortured one - or both, if that\'s the case - of the girls because Lohan is so exhausted that it is nauseating. Her personal image off the camera, she looked terrible in this movie, but the movie sucked too. What were they smoking to put that disaster in theaters? Hmm, it sounds like a bad trip ... Lohan has that raucous, raucous voice that gets on your nerves, like your cousin Miley Cyrus, and it stays on your last nerve very quickly, like a creaking knob. You have no idea what\'s going on at the beginning, and then it turns out to be worse than the most horrible offer Lifetime has given us over the years. Terrible casting and lousy dialogue are all boosted by a stupid title that does not make it seem true. Too bad he did not go straight on a cliff. Add to that the annoying Julia Ormond ""joking"" about a mother who happens to let her daughter come up with a boyfriend and raise her brain too high. Oh yeah ? I do not care who you think you are; amnesia - or whatever - would not be enough for me to let my children indulge in carnal pleasures under my roof. You do not like any of these characters and you do not feel sorry for them. That\'s the key to a great movie in ANY genre - feeling compassion, or at least empathy - for at least two people in a movie. There is none of this here, and we are treated with tons of bloody scenes that do not even come up with the intended effect. When you get to that, the best actors in IKWKM were the blue rose petals. In short, two hours have been dismembered from my life that I will never go back.'",0
"b'This film is in English and its main star is American. However, it is a Japanese collaborative effort. As essentially a Japanese horror film, it has some things in common with ""The Grudge"". ""Here, once again, we have a haunting that conveys shivers as his face is cut with his hair hanging. I do not know why hiding an apparition behind hair strands is such a scary effect - but it is. In addition, the premise of driving down a lonely road at night is sinister by itself. And when you have a dead body in the trunk of your car - the ride becomes doubly fraught with danger. The acting is usually made of wood. The actress who plays one of the main love interests is Japanese, with a very limited mastery of the English language. With so many actors eagerly available to appear in movies, I do not know why they do not find better talent. So this movie is not memorable. But it is not a complete waste of time. This will make you think twice the next time you put a corpse in your car and head towards the nearest lake to discard it. You will realize that you may have some night terrors along the way.'",0

"b'I agree with the first guy. This movie pack was not so good. I bought it in hopes of seeing some actual combat scenes (or any other footage) taken from the Vietnam War. instead, each VHS that supposedly specifically targets a US fighting aspect in Vietnam (ie the Marines, Bombers, Navy, Helicopters, etc.) shows the same footage over and over again. For example, every video shows a dive helicopter firing rockets and B-52s throwing bombs, which is cool the first time you see it, but after 10,000 times it gets old and you realize you lost your money.'",0

Compared to Baby Beethovan, Baby Mozart keeps his attention continuously. There are some parts of the Baby Beethovan DVD that have pictures of animals and my son did not like that. He prefers to see the animals move than to see a picture of them. Hey, that's what the books are for, right? He also loves Baby Eistein Language for the same reasons.

"b'I\'m trying to get back in shape. I can do the 2 mile walk from Leslie Sansone no problem, but after about 20 minutes of this DVD, my heart rate was very high and I was starting to sizzle. This is a good workout and something to build, but very discouraging for a true beginner. Also, everyone on the DVD is very suitable - there is not much incentive here for someone just getting started. Also, ""jump"" included, which is just recipe for an injury on the beginner. I think beginners should avoid this training.'",0

"b'This small, bizarre cinematic exercise from low-budget schlockmeister Bill Zebub owes much of his inspiration, I imagine, to the South Park team\'s (vastly superior) team epic. After a long comic ""confrontation"" at the beginning of the film, the ""plot"" essentially tries to parody many Hollywood, political and religious, and inject as many disturbing images of sexually mutilated Barbi dolls as possible. Actiing is provided by a variety of \'action figure\' toys that are manipulated (awkwardly) by hand and through overlays of green screens. A little of that is fun, but ultimately the concept runs out of gas, and Zebub\'s macabre preoccupation with the voracious images of sadomasochism perpetuated on female dolls is kind of scary. Still, there is some intelligence in the basic concept that makes this satirical flik more enveloping than many of Zebub\'s seemingly most serious efforts. I would recommend just buying this (if at all) at a discounted (discounted) minimum price, as the content probably would not support multiple views.'",0

"b'Ah, Gargoyles, finally getting a well-deserved DVD release. This series is really excellent and has the honor of being one of the most animated animated series of Disney until today. The series revolves around a group of live gargoyles, which are stones during the day and meat at night. Due to a curse on them, a small group of these creatures are frozen in stone for a thousand years before being awakened in Manhattan in 1994. Like all supernatural beings in Manhattan, they naturally decide to fight crime. It may sound cheesy, but in the hands of a splendid team of writers, the series becomes much more than just another story of ""non-human crimes fighting superheroes."" Instead, Gargoyles becomes an interesting story with engaging storyline and good characters. This series is aided by its ability to take risks - the first episode ends even with what is essentially a mass murder. The program also addresses issues such as gun control in a very mature and realistic manner, while at the same time not being overly moralistic or prejudiced. For example, the episode of Gun Control \'Deadly Force\' (shamefully omitted by Toon Disney in its series due to the presence of weapons and shootings, despite its strong message against the inexperienced game with such weapons and fortunately restored uncut at launch of the DVD) conveys his message without having the characters standing up saying ""weapons are bad, mm\'kay?"" The series also has a stiffness of continuity rarely seen in American cartoons; actions in earlier episodes later affect the episodes have a well-defined order - unlike some other Disney toons at the time, Gargoyles episodes usually had to be displayed in the correct order to make sense. episode of the second season contains, of all things, a joke of Kafka that I did not get for * years *.) Gargoyles is actually one of the cartoon series more interesting and original in the Disney safe. This DVD is a great buy for longtime fans and highly recommended to new curious people about what it all is. The first season beautifully creates the rest of the series and gives the viewer an idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bwhat this series is all about. I\'m already looking forward to future releases of the rest of the series.'",1

"b'If anyone doubts the temporal quality of fame, think of Douglas Fairbanks to bring the matter home. In its time, the fame of Douglas Fairbanks was unpublished. He and his wife, Mary Pickford, were considered the royal family of America. Today, his wonderful action movies are not watched except by moviegoers, and his face and name are lost to the younger generation (if Jay Leno\'s interviews are indicative, our younger Americans seem proud not to know the name ""The Mark of Zorro"" is a good example of the kind of film that Fairbanks specialized in at the end of the era. from the silent movies, and was very popular because of the dynamic presence of his star. watch Fairbanks jump on the tables, jump on the walls of the chest to ride a horse, jump from a table to a cornice near a tee to, etc. And it was not only because he was able to do these feats, it was that he did them effortlessly. The pure grace of man was truly moving. He never seemed to strive for anything. I sensed this as I watched the Mark of the Zorro during a scene where Fairbanks lifts one leg and dismounts a horse running at full gallop to land as easily as it was coming out of the ladder. He made it seem so easy, I came back and watched the scene again to make sure I saw what I thought I\'d seen. Yes, he had done it - smooth as silk. Then there is his acting. In this film, Fairbanks plays a dueling role: Don Diego, a young noble fanatic, and his masked colleague, Zorro. His interpretation of Don Diego is subtle and effective. Your body looks formless and soft. Her manner is distracted and indecisive and vaguely lost. He hates fencing and is constantly wiping his face because of his great ""fatigue"". ""When his love interest declares"" He is not a man - he is a fish! \'\' it hits the nail on the head. However, when he wears the mask, his body and his manner are reborn. His body looks agile and full of movement, and his smile, that tremendous radiant smile that radiates pure happiness, is almost as devastating as his sword. Finally, there is the artistic design and sets of this film. Fairbanks loved these pieces of the period and spared no expense of research and detail. Their care, financial investment and dedication to craftsmanship really show. Everything has a beautiful, deep feel. As a side note, this review is based on the Kino DVD release of this movie, and as with all Kino releases, this edition looks just great. God bless Kino for being one of the best companies that preserves and markets silent films. If you bothered to read this review, please purchase this movie. If you do, Douglas Fairbanks will be popular and famous again, at least in your heart.-Mykal Banta'",1

"b'MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT multi-movie packages are very reasonable and of good quality. These twenty unrestored transfers of films in the public domain range from very good to sometimes fair - none is ever unattainable. The ""legendary detectives"" in this DVD package are all series of derivative films of the 1930s and 40s. ""The Shadow"" was a half-hour radio series broadcast for the first time on 7/31/30. Originally only the narrator of mystery stories, in 1937, ""Shadow"" Lamont Cranston (now played by a young Orson Welles) has become an integral character in each episode shown. The 24-year program ended the day after Christmas in 1954. The three Shadow films were first seen in 1937 at the height of the radio program\'s popularity. The `` Bulldog Drummond \'\' was created in 1920 by the British writer Herman McNeile, who published under the pseudonym `` Sapper. Drummond\'s stories were directly influenced by noir detectives, then popular in American fiction, and are considered the forerunners of James Bond. The half-dozen movies in this set that characterize this character are all from the late 1930s. ""Dick Tracy"" was a comic book fighter brought to life by the pen and imagination of Detroit artist Chester Gould in October 1931. Gould worked on the strips until retiring in 1977. Other artists are still producing the stories 76 years after the series began. In comics, Detective Tracy courted future wife Tess Trueheart for 18 years, finally marrying her on Christmas Day 1949. During that time, Tracy\'s square chin faced legendary bad guys like BB Eyes, Jones Flattop, Pruneface, Haf and Haf, 88 Keys, Mr, Crime, Sphinx, Pear-shape and Faceless Redrum. Dick Tracy\'s radio program aired from 1935 to \'48. In the films Tracy was portrayed mainly by Ralph Byrd (from 1937). Byrd stayed with the series until it ended after a brief run at the start of the television. ""Sherlock Holmes"", the most famous detective of all fiction, was the creation of the Scottish writer and doctor Arthur Conan Doyle. Holmes\'s stories have been published in several British magazines since 1887. Over the years, Conan Doyle has tried more than once to kill the character, but public outcry has made him reconsider. Doyle wrote four novels and fifty-six tales starring Holmes and Dr. John Watson, his friend and adventure cohort, until the death of the knight-author in 1930.

To avoid conflict, all feelings and feelings are suppressed by constant monitoring and injecting drugs. People who violate the dictated rule are hunted by ""clergymen"" and eliminated by incineration. The character Christian Bales is one of the ""clergymen"". ""He is a single father of two children whose wife was burned. He is a top cleric, but as the film progresses, he begins to have doubts about what he is doing. Ultimately, he seeks underground resistance leaders who are literally clandestine, forced to live in a secret room. full of a mix of paintings, books, antique toys and bric a brac (not unlike a modern teenager\'s room). Inspired by a young girl he has in custody and a cute puppy, he joins the resistance.

I\'ve seen this film approaching 70 times, and I know where the beats are, from top to bottom. I was looking for changes and could not detect any. Even the slight cut like ET indicates that the cabinet as ""home"" is restored. ILM\'s original animation of the in-flight bikes is back. The passage of the strings during the final hug is exactly where it should be. All terrible trapers were removed. The transfer of the original 35mm elements is as perfect as possible.

"b'This will be referred to as a classic horror in the years to come ... a horrible classic example of how Hollywood money can destroy a very good story. The plot, what\'s in it, bears no resemblance to Shirley Jackson\'s psychological horror story. They\'re bits of nonsense, and dead ends. There are many special effects and CGI, which would undoubtedly make up for the missing story. They do not. Nothing here is scary, unless you think the thought of hiring hilarious wooden cherubs is scary. Scenarios for the house were the best part, being completely bizarre and unreal and therefore worth seeing. Liam Neeson seems to have been blackmailed to take the role, and Owen Wilson, with a fixed smile like the above-mentioned wooden cherub, acts as if he\'s been in a comedy from the beginning. The women, Lili Taylor and Catherine Zeta-Jones, manage a little better considering the material given to them. Zeta-Jones certainly looks good, colorful and all, but nothing is given to do except stroll around to look colorful tarty. Bruce Dern and Marian Seldes seem to be enjoying themselves in their roles as janitors, but they were probably happy to have such small parties. That does not make it a ""good"" bad movie, and it really would not be worth hating, except for the fact that it\'s spooked a scary and clever book.'",0

"b'""The Highwaymen,"" by Robert Harmon, is a thrilling quick ride that grabs you in the first frames and does not let you go until it shakes your brains 81 minutes later. Like Rennie, Jim Caviezel gives another poignant performance as the haunted husband who watches his wife run down a successful driver and spends years running after the guy. Caviezel\'s role is not as demanding or as satisfying as his performance as Catch in `` Angel Eyes, \'\' but it\'s well done. Colm Feore of `` Chronicles of Riddick \'`` Paycheck\' \'and `` Chicago\' \'is menacing as the disabled driver whose only pleasure in life is to terrorize and kill women with his car. I watched the film with an occupational therapist who had several comments about the portrait of the disabled. Rhona Mitra, a TV star who shone brilliantly in ""Party of 5,"" ""Gideon\'s Crossing,"" ""The Practice,"" and now ""Boston Legal,"" does a great job chasing, scared and fighting back. She shows several levels, in fact more demanding than her appearances in ""The Life of David Gale,"" ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" or ""Get Carter."" ""Frankie Faison, who plays the traffic inspector, has 4 movies this year and is a very busy actor (White Chicks, Cookout). Your police detective is a little slow to realize the gravity of what is happening and becomes a complication to Rennie\'s quest, but ends up becoming an ally in the last farewell attempt. Andrea Roth as the blonde Alex does a good job, but brief, before being incorporated into the windshield of the Eldorado Cadillac. Yes there are some holes in the plot and some jumps in editing, but despite all this it is a great tour of a movie. Appreciate !'",1

"b'Unlike most other films reviewed, the comments for this movie are actually quite accurate. The film details the rise of Ziegfeld\'s three-girl stardom; Judy\'s character rises to stardom, Hedy\'s character retreats to a comfortable married life, while Lana\'s character ""is a cultivator."" The plot is too long, and Lamarr\'s plot in particular is banal and uninteresting. It\'s the numbers on one side, and Turner\'s on the other, who make this movie. The story of Lana\'s rise and fall from stardom is the only one worth seeing. This fleshy role was the role that narrowed Lana\'s stardom. Also, the numbers are stellar. Some may say overproduced, but I say spectacular - more particularly, the number ""Out of a Dream"" has the most glamorous clothes ever seen on the celluloid. I\'ve never seen such feminine beauty in my life; beauty floating down the ethereal stairs, the ethereal music sung by Tony Martin. You will want to watch again and again. Here are a few mistakes to watch: 1. In the ""Minnie from Trinidad"" number, right after the mule is seen, you can see a dancer coming out of the set in the background - very out of sync with the song. The first time I saw this, I could not believe that the publisher had missed this. Notice Judy VERY closely as she descends the stairs in the number ""Out of a Dream""; you can see glimpses of nudity as she approaches the bottom of the stairs! 3 In the ""Out of a Dream"" number, all the girls are smiling ... except for Hedy Lamarr. This contrast is shocking. Hedy Lamarr\'s teeth were out of alignment in real life. She is an actress who was much prettier when she did not smile.'",1

It is difficult to see the kata being performed clearly and, due to the lack of audio in the clips (the only sound is the narrator and the funeral scene at the end), the breath can not be heard. The video is blurry and dark. and visually & quot; noisy & quot; . The funeral scene at the end is so dark that it's hard to see anything. Do not waste your money""",0
"b""In the 1960s, when filmmaking was still an art form, master puppeteer manipulator George Pal created what was considered a true classic, The Time Machine. Selecting as his hero, handsome and courageous Austrian actor Rod Taylor, playing Herbert George Wells, the director accurately portrays the adventurous but moody, Victorian as a gentleman, who plays with inventions and yearns for a more peaceful century to live . . Using what has been hailed as the best special effects of that date, Pal launches Taylor in the future. Stopping only to observe the changing eras where war is waged with better and more sophisticated weapons, Wells finally arrives at Eloi's land. Here he meets the beautiful and sensual Weena (Yvette Mimieux) and his people. During their brief time together, Weena lets Wells know that despite her idyllic paradise, it is not without perils. In this future, it is the Morlocks who have become the masters of the world and have stolen the Wells time machine. Condemned to spend eternity in the future, Taylor engages in battle with the Morlocks, resulting in a story that he later will relate to David Filby (Alan Young) and his Victorian friends. The film is superb and although it has been redone several times, it has never been matched. Mr Wells would have approved. *****""",1
"b""I loved the Minority Report. The movie deceived me early and took me on a fantastic ride. The story is complex, but in a small paragrah I'll tell you a bit about it. John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the head of Pre-Crime in Washington D.C. and is charged with future murder. The movie then goes on a wild goose chase where he is trying to prove he did not do it. Tom Cruise is great in the movie. This is one of his greatest performances ever. He plays the character well. You feel for John Anderton as you watch the movie unwind. You feel for him because of the good acting that Cruise does.Colin Farrel is good in the movie too. He plays Danny Whitmore, a federal agent who is trying to see if it works before the crime. He ends up chasing Anderton in the movie. He plays the character so well. Farrel does such a good job of making you hate him. I love that sort of thing. The special effects of the film are some of the best of all time. They bring some scary ideas into the movie that could be possible sometime in the future. Roger Ebert said & quot; Minority Report reminds us why we are going to the movies & quot; and I could not agree more. This is a cinematic and compelling masterpiece for any DVD collection.""",1
"b'I watched this DVD again the other day. I had not seen it for about two years since I started. I was having trouble getting rid of a resentment I had against someone. I was so uncomfortable with my feelings that I could not sleep. So I had the thought \'why not touch it? ""I put the DVD to refresh my memory in simple technique. In a few minutes, I was ringing and feeling relief. Before I started playing, my anger was about 8-9 on a scale of 0-10. After a few minutes, it was for a 2, and then as the night progressed, my anger completely disappeared. I like and recommend this DVD because I have the look that a book (no matter how well written) does not provide. This is really amazing.'",1
"b'Ok, quickly and without hesitation, click the ""Back"" button on your browser as often as necessary to stay completely away from seeing anything that has to do with this movie. If you did not pay attention to my advice above, then you\'re obviously watching train wrecks, ten stacks of cars and little kids frying ants with your magnifying glass. In other words, you\'re a cinematic sadist. If you\'ve ever seen this movie, you\'ve probably lost some self-esteem. If you plan to see it after reading this review ... you are just a masochist. Bloodyne is horrible. Besides horrible. Ben Kingsley made some bad career choices in his day, but this one takes the cake. Michael Madsen, who used to be considered respectable, if not large, is descending his career downhill faster than a landslide in California after a monsoon. Michelle Rodriguez, who has openly stated that she wants to be a gypsy actress, a free spirit, is the most unspoilt, simply because you\'re going to limit yourself to that kind of professional decision. That does not get her off the hook of this farce. I can not imagine anyone as rebellious as she stood, still as that pile of garbage was being thrown around her like garbage in a landfill. And then there\'s Kristana Loken ... well, you can see her naked. This is about highlighting your role. And what the hell is Meatloaf doing in this movie ... and credited by his COMPLETE name? ! Has he chosen this atrocity to decide that he wants to be credited with two names instead of one? THERE IS ? ! Everyone is unknown, which surprisingly does not leave many roles for the unknown. It was incredible how they accumulated this group of actors named by something so horribly bad. It\'s not just the actors, it\'s the dialogue, the F / X and even the plot ... that escapes me at the moment. I think I\'m trying to remove this movie from my memory. So do yourself a favor and stay away, stay away, away. Trust me, it\'s for your own good.'",0

"b""The Italian work of the 1960s is well known to the British public, for whom the film is as common on the Christmas TV show as the James Bond films The Great Escape and the Queen's speech. Negative reviews of American viewers result both from the lack of a cultural context and from the ignorance of many people in the cast. The film has aged well and offers a fun snapshot of the British culture of the 1960s. The cast includes Noel Coward as Mr. Bridger, the crime leader, and Michael Caine as the failed Charlie Croker. The British public will recognize a number of well-known actors in special roles, including Benny Hill and John Le Mesurier. The stars of the film are undoubtedly the cars. Curiously, the 1960s supercar variety, including a Lamborghini Muira, E-Type Jaguars and Charlie's Aston Martin, are being overshadowed by the three Mini Coopers who lead the Italian police in an incredible car race in Turin. Remy Julienne and his stunt team produced one of the most incredible and known, at least for the British public, car chases in the movies. Undoubtedly, it is still considered one of the best car chase sequences and even more so because acrobatics were actually filmed in Turin (and Coventry in the case of sewage scenes) and in cars with minimal modifications. There are many memorable moments. in the film beyond the sequence of the Mini Cooper. Caine's 'blew the doors', Benny Hill's obsessed woman, Professor Peach, on the tram in Turin, and the end of the 'hanging', in my mind. The DVD's extra features are good, but not truly remarkable. The documentary 'Making Of' provides several interesting insights about the film. The track of comment overlays is a bit flamboyant, but worth listening to. There is only one scene deleted, the incredible ballet 'Blue Danube' on the ice. In summary, this is a true British classic with a great cast, soundtrack and plot. A good snapshot of London from the 60's, a fantastic (at least for the UK public) and the superb car chase scene make this the first to buy. The remake of Hollywood, although not a bad movie in its own right, shares only the title, a plot based on a gold theft and the BMW Mini updated with the original. And for anyone asking about the original of the Mini, they really are small and lots of fun to drive.""",1

The actors were super slow with the fight scenes (as if they were practicing) and the dialogues were stupid. Waste of talent for Ben Kingsley (which is always good as we all know).

"b'28 Days Later is a film so well treated in terms of suspense, acting and meaning, that every time I watch it I become more convinced that it will become a classic in the horror-science fiction genre. It is not so with the ""sequence,"" which Fresnadillo may well be directing, but is not well structured as narrative, and does not lend any valuable ""message"" to the public. 28 Weeks Later often incurs the error of insulting our intelligence. How can you explain that the survivor\'s husband who is detained in a security health facility can gain access to the room without finding a guard, no doctors, no soldiers, no surveillance personnel at the scene? There are no cameras even in a situation where the reappearance of the virus is feared and it is possible after the diagnosis made by the medical staff of the female survivor. In fact, this is the main event that causes virus violation. In addition, the film is so focused on bloodshed, bites and vampire races that no meaningful dialogue is possible, preventing anyone from making any sense of the chaos. And what can you say about the helicopter used as a deadly saw to decapitate dozens of vampire zombies? The least I can say is that the scene is the height of sensationalism. And insisting on the meaning of the film, why such a valuable element in the story as the possibility that the female survivor or her children hold the key to curing the virus is just a waste in favor of leaving the public with a final terrible, pessimistic and fatal? Is this the bait for another sequel, parallel to the ""Alien"" series? Meanwhile, we get a ""sequel"" that does not properly honor 28 Days Later, no matter the fact that Boyle is among the producers.'",0
"b""It's a shame that Bruce Willis is not able to produce more movies. John McClain is probably the greatest action hero in all of movie history and this installment has a lot of action and humor. McClain is invited to bring in a suspicious hacker to be interviewed by the FBI. The actor who plays this hacker is the guy who does the commercials of Apple McIntosh. It's interesting to note that he seems to prefer a Mac in this. Anyway, McClain appears as soon as the hacker is about to be hit by the bad guys. If it were some other movie, it would be a guy with a magnum or piano wire, but being a Hard Killed movie, villains come with ultra modern machine guns. Of course McClain is able to take some of them and temporarily run away with the hacker. Thus, we have the result of a great partnership as good as any other for the films of Lethal Weapons. The movie gives you applause everywhere, especially when McClain insults the bad guy in the head when talking to one of his top members and then tells him I'm coming. Kevin Smith has a great turnout as Warlock, a live at home with his mother computer hacker. It's a role that seems to have been made for him. This is the best Die Hard since the first movie!""",1
"b""I had no idea that Ganz had in him to be so great until I saw him here as Hitler. Alexandra Maria Lara as her naive young secretary is also very good. The cast is excellent. Director Oliver Hirschbieger cleverly pulls everything together and will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way through - though we all know how the tale has ended. The film gets under your skin and it pokes at your psyche long after you've seen it - and this is some trick. How did the creators of this movie achieve this? By avoiding the usual approach of making Hitler and his thugs SS thugs as two-dimensional cartoon characters, instead, they show their lot to be what they were: humans. Mass murderers mixed up, misguided, fanatical, barbarian, cold-blooded - and all in search of power (which they never attained), but humans nonetheless. What is sad here, as far as I am concerned, instead of encouraging your nation to concentrate all this energy on making the world a better place, because the Germans, the German people, gave us much more than good cars and excellent lenses of beer and camera ... Hitler and his henchmen had their people squandering all this potential in causing destruction and chaos, misery and pain ... for nothing. I realize that some Germans did not care about Hitler and his crazy notions ... but there was not much they could do about (once he came to power and they saw where he was actually taking them ... straight to hell ). Any German who opposed the dreaded SS and the Gestapo ended up dead or somewhere in the country somewhere to suffer the consequences. I've always wondered what it must have been like for Hitler and his people in that bunker during the last months / weeks / days. .. This powerful movie shows what happened - and then some.""",1
"b""Anyone reading these reviews will see the TV production and know it from the inside out; therefore, I will limit my review to the quality of the DVD image - or rather, lack thereof. It's a shame that what used to be a beautiful and memorable TV movie has become a worn and faded shadow of your old self. It is painful to see something occupying a special place in your heart be treated so meanly. For years, the only version that millions saw on TV had colors so faded and low contrast that it almost seemed to have been filmed in black and white! If this is what you are accustomed to, & quot; restored & quot; The version of this DVD (and the one shown on TV in the last 3 or 4 years) looks a bit better, but it is hardly restored. Just look at a deleted music in the extras section to see how the original production was beautiful and bright: crisp, clear, immaculate, with highly saturated colors. Time and money must have been spent to bring the rest of the film to that standard. It is morally wrong to put a defective product on the market, so have the courage to charge money for it. As many of our parents probably told us when we were young, & quot; It pays to do anything worthwhile! & quot;""",0

"b'I just watched this movie. It\'s slow, yes, but it also does not have any REAL plot, PERIOD. The actors have no skill except the leader Jasmine, who may have potential over time. The scenes did not connect and were extremely busy. It is my strong opinion that the other criticisms MUST be connected to the producer / writer / actors in order to give any kind of positive review. This film is truly sacrilegious, blasphemous and disrespectful to the Church and God. I am not a ""sacred roll"", but I feel there must be some things that are respected and not ridiculed.

"b""For the most part, I enjoyed most of the things that Paul Anderson did; nothing amazing, but still some decent things. So I was not ready to condemn this movie before seeing it in the theater. I was hoping he would do a lot more with this franchise than the movie, but I still found it nice enough to buy the DVD and now Blu-Ray (I certainly think it's a better movie than the second Predator) and 3rd and 4th Aliens.) Blu-Ray includes the unrated / director cut and the added scenes help to explain a bit more of the story and is definitely the best version to watch. The acting is pretty blah (with the A & P-out -acting most humans), although Ewen Bremner is funny. But the action is really about what this movie is and there is a lot of action here and what I thought was a pretty good ending. As for the transfer of Blu-Ray, it is very good; the image is very clear and the dark scenes (most of the film) look very good. The soundtrack is also cool and the extra trivia feature is cool.""",1
"b""This version of Jane Eyre is one of my favorites. I excitedly pre-ordered this DVD a month ago when I discovered it. Unfortunately, I can only give this DVD two stars. This is a better star than the last `` remastered '' version I reviewed ... the extra star is due to the fact that THIS is not at least missing a whole scene. Far from being remastered as alleged this release is, if you can believe it, even worse than I reviewed. First, it is dark and muddy - I had to raise the brightness of my TV almost all the way to see any detail. Second, the image is almost always filled with long scratches (sometimes in the middle), black and white drop-outs, and a hair or fiber that appears at the top of the screen during the front credits. Thirdly, the color floats several times throughout the film. Fourth, in some scenes, the sound is a bit scratchy. And, above all, the launch company (VCI Entertainment), not content to lie on its packaging, had the GALL to insert `` This Special Edition was restored digitally to their current condition '' before the movie. There is 'truth in advertising' for you. I can not figure out why it's so impossible to get a good version of this movie. But I'm tired of releasing companies lying about remastering. Do not lie to my leg and tell me it's raining.""",0

And Anthony Hopkins is also miscado as a Jewish teacher with a hard blow, secret past. While he remains one of my favorite actors, he can not escape his ""britanicity,"" which is even more unbelievable when you discover what your character\'s past is! The real discovery of this movie is the absolutely amazing turnaround of Wentworth Miller as teenager Anthony Hopkins. Ultimately, the movie is worth being seen only by Wentworth Miller.

But they will be confronted by ancestral tribes who oppose them, for they will interrupt the dream of the green ants.

"b'For starters, I\'m a lifelong bodybuilder and fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger, so even though he\'s strictly a co-star on that, I\'m obviously partial. That said, however, I absolutely love this whole movie! One of my favorite parts is the way some of the best advice I\'ve heard about friendships and relationships in general is dispensed with throughout the movie, sometimes you did not even realize that you were learning something. Examples: Joe Santo (Arnold) is putting Craig Blake (Jeff Bridges) in training and advising him: ""You can not grow without getting burned! `` and we realize how deep it was when Joe repeats these words as the two dispute the reason Mary Tate Farnsworth (Sally Field) left Joe for Craig. In addition, there is Craig\'s uncle, Albert, whose voice is heard earlier, sometimes reading letters to Craig, telling him: ""No matter what you do, as long as you do something, and do it relentlessly.

Dean Cain, he of Superman\'s fame, shakes his way through the mess, chewing his chewing gum and shuddering after he is shot in the leg. Scott Wiper, who plays his envious comrade mercifully vanishes when he leaves, but the movie never tells him what happens to him. The movie starts with Cain and Wiper (looks like a law firm, does not it?) Facing some really nasty guys who are obviously attacking women in this underwater mining plant. Nothing is explained because they are doing it, but Cain kills them all but one, a nasty guy who plans to take revenge. Meanwhile, many of the crew are committing suicide, and Cain is investigating. (Excited yet?). Of course, all of this culminates in a kind of HIGH NOON underwater when the thug who promised to return, does so with two other henchmen, and pursues Cain for the plant for a while. There\'s nothing exciting about it, because the steering is made of wood and the action is abysmal.

"b'I saw this movie about a month ago at the local cinematheque. About eighty minutes I looked discreetly at my watch and was disappointed with the realization that the film was not even halfway. Celine and Julie go by boat? There was not a body of water, much less a boat, in sight so far. Where was this bizarre story with scenes being repeated several times, and when would it end? I am a patient movie viewer, but that was too much. A number of film critics, whose opinions I usually respect, have practically built religions around their appreciation of this film. I wondered if this could just be a case of the ""emperor\'s new clothes""? Almost two hours later, it was all over and I left the theater thinking I might have seen two real cinematographic masterpieces in the time I wasted on the Rivette movie ... But somehow, it was not really over. The effect of the film remained. It was not just an intellectual conundrum I needed to deal with, the movie had affected me. Scenes kept repeating in my head like a strange dream. Her pace was unlike anything I\'d encountered before. Celine and Julie have never adapted to any of my expectations - and neither does Jacques Rivette. In two separate scenes in the film, Celine and Julie introduce themselves to the men, who unconsciously think they are meeting the other woman. In each case, the two women completely subvert the worlds of men, opening gaps in their rigid conventionality. Throughout the movie, Rivette was doing the same thing to me. Everything about the movie, from the ""plot"" to the subtle manipulation of reality to the beat, forces you to abandon your expectations (or to feel unhappy in trying to hold them). You have to relate to the movie on your own level, as you would with a child. Only then can you have fun. I do not know exactly why the movie had such an effect on me, but it says something about its power that, over a month later, I\'m still thinking about it. In recent days, I\'ve had this growing need to see `` Celine and Julie Go Boating \'\' again. The ideal circumstance for a first date with him is definitely in a theater or you might end up hanging up. Now that I\'ve gone through Rubicon, I\'d like it to be available in a region of 0 or 1 DVD so that I could lose another three hours.'",1
"b""& quot; Back to the Future & quot; it can be the most charming comedy / adventure that exists.

While sci-fi films less focused on the ideas of time and hardware paradoxes, & quot; & quot; Back to the Future & quot; focuses on wonder with open eyes, charming characters and very good humor.The story begins with Marty McFly in the year 1985. Marty is a hopeless lazy with two idiot parents and a mad scientist friend. Marty's friend, Doc Brown, perfected a pluto-powered time machine made from a DeLorean sports car. After a successful test, Marty is accidentally transplanted to the year 1955 and abandoned there, he left his extra plutonium in 1985. What happens next is a series of wonderful surprises when Marty interacts with the people of the city of 1950 while looking for the younger version of Doc Brown, but what's even more surprising and magical is Marty's relationship with his parents as teenagers. The film takes the perspective of a young man from his loser parents and makes him realize that his parents were as hopeful and fearful as he was. He finally meets his parents for the first time. The film also suggests the hopeful notion that you can go back in time and help your parents when they need it most, as Marty certainly does. While the film is a light hearted joke, there is plenty of action as Doc Brown devises an exciting scheme to bring Marty back into the future involving lightning, many visual effects and a high-tech race. & quot; Back to the Future & quot; is the most perfectly balanced blend of science fiction, comedy and adventure.

"b'""I Know Who Killed Me"" is a vile little horror game that was conceived as a kind of ""comeback"" vehicle for Lindsay Lohan in early 2007. Needless to say, the movie was unsuccessful in that effort. Anything but.Lohan plays Aubrey Fleming, an attractive but relatively naive high school student who is the victim of a serial killer crazy for tortures that manages to cut off some of her limbs before she miraculously escapes her claws. When she wakes up at the hospital, she believes she\'s a girl named Dakota Moss, a sort of fictional alter ego with a life of soft-porn dating - which provides us with ample opportunity for Lohan to wear lightly as she squirms in slow motion performing pole dances on a sloppy striper joint. It is Aubrey, herself a fiction writer, simply a victim of repression, a wild, free spirit so obsessed with being a ""good girl"" that she allowed her true nature to remain buried in her subconscious. years? And the trauma she has suffered is simply the vehicle through which this true nature can now surface? Or is there another explanation less purely psychological - say, symbiotic twins? - by this sudden change of identity? It does not really matter what the answers to these questions are, for this depressing incursion into sadism, dismemberment and supernatural spells is poorly written, amateurish, and utterly devoid of emotion or common sense. In fact, the story itself might have some validity if it had not forced the audience to dive into as many free wear as it. But as it is, whenever we begin to develop even the slightest interest in what is happening, we are subject to another round of sangria revving the stomach. Disgusting .'",0
"b'This 1914 film is considered the first full-length feature comedy of all time and as such is worth seeing only for this. The film, however, is less interesting. Of course, this is bullshit, but I personally found the character Tillie quite ridiculous; ridiculous, moreover, without being particularly amusing. It is invented to seem - and apparently acts as - - a trailing guy promising a fraternity. Marie Dressler, then 45, playing a character supposedly young as ""Tillie,"" is less comical than distracting. If you\'re going to take time to see this movie, in other words, you should be doing it simply to see a historically significant movie. So, no, it\'s not a movie you\'ll probably want to have and watch again and again, unless you\'re simply in love with anything Chaplin did. If you have not seen anything of Chaplin, do not start here! And if you\'re a keen Chaplin fan, you\'d be better served (if you mind being fun), experiencing some of your much bigger efforts. For the curious, I offer a brief synopsis of Tillie\'s pierced novel: `` What is it that he has - one of Ringling\'s elephants? \'\' So, watch the character of Mabel Normand (so to speak, in this silent film) as she spies Chaplin\'s \'City Guy\' arm with `` Built like a battleship \'\' Tillie. Tillie ""has a bankroll as thick as she does,"" explains the character of Chaplin to Normand, his former partner in crime. Then, once successful in raising Tillie\'s money, Chaplin runs off with Normand. Upon hearing Tillie\'s apparent $ 3 million inheritance shortly thereafter, he returns to her and begs Tillie to marry him as quickly as possible. Later they shout at many of the quests (with Normand working as a hired helper) at a commemorative party at Tillies\' ""new"" house, until his uncle - dead - returns to claim him back, throwing them into the street when he does it. A key police chase follows the entire town and waterfront along a boardwalk and then ends with Normand and (a soggy) Tillie agreeing that Chaplin\'s favor is not worth pursuing anyway.

"b'Having grown up with the original Thunderbirds on TV (even on B & W), I was hoping for something better. I suppose, since I\'m starting a little, pubescent teen angst does not appeal much anymore. I wanted to see the machines, the drama, the tension of the people dealing with disasters that took them beyond them, the triumph of decent people over the impersonal malevolence of nature and all those good things that the original had in abundance, along with a campiness and humor that does not take itself too seriously. The original was about the first adventure, with the incidental \'romance\', and that\'s an important point, quite lost in this film. This is a \'growing\' teen movie that uses the Thunderbirds as a cover. I really did not need the Thunderbirds, except for the sets. The plot is perfectly normal and can be seen anywhere. The degree of improbability involved is much greater than the originals and a little difficult to bear. The acting leaves a lot to be desired, but the 1960s dolls were far more real than the actors in this movie, and Ben Kingsley does not seem to be so bad, or even badly tempered. You want a teen movie like so many others, this is for you. If you want something similar to the original, do not bother with this movie. Wait until someone has the guts to produce an ""adult"" movie (rated ""G"") in the classic genre. Unfortunately, this is not a particularly memorable movie.'",0
"b""Watch American In Paris Blu-Ray and you'll know what's wrong with Gigi. The opening sequence is granulated. Transitions from scene to scene are bad. It appears that the printout returns to the analog for a fraction of a second before the cut. I'm very disappointed in that. If it were not for the extras, especially the 1949 Gigi from France, I would play it. Gigi is a great movie and one of my favorites but I was expecting a better Blu-Ray quality. My old widescreen VHS looks almost as good not the big Sony. And where is the Overture sequence?""",0
"b'Carole Lombard was a beautiful intelligent natural blonde, the highest female comedian of Screwball, the highest paid actress, wife of Clark Gable and one of Hollywood\'s most powerful women during the 1930s until her untimely death in 1942. This beautifully restored DVD gives us a taste of Carole Lombard and the effect she had on the audience of the 1930s. This was her only Technicolor film she ever made. So sit back and watch your natural beauty and your genius evolve on the screen. Fredric March, as his co-star, adds to this adorably humorous film. In summary: A Vermont girl, Hazel Flagg (Lombard), diagnosed to have radio poisoning (terminal). A hot shot from the New York Jounalist (March) reads about it in a newspaper and wants to use this event to increase the popularity of their magazines by sponsoring Hazel. Bringing her to New York City and presenting her with the ""Keys to the City"" and VIP status enhances public awareness. All the time using the public sympathy to increase magazine sales. Hazel discovers that she has been misdiagnosed and reluctantly continues with the fraud. In the meantime, March begins to fall in love with Hazel and he wants her to rest and be comfortable until the end of it arrives. As you can see, this has a strange twist on events, which is the main ingredient of the 1930\'s ""SCREWBALL COMBS"" proving `` nothing is sacred! \'\' ! ! Extras include: 2 early Lombard movies and Gable & Lombard home movies. This is a `` LIMITED EDITION \'\' collectible DVD.'",1
"b""First, let me say that, as a former military man, I am a huge fan of this film. I am also aware that when I write a review of anything here, there are many ad hominem attacks, not refutations of the review, which makes me reluctant to comment on anything. Having said that, I must admit that I am very disappointed with this Criterion of the Four Feathers issue. I always thought of Criterion's DVDs as the best, and I thought the blu-ray edition would be absolutely perfect, however, this is not the case. I own an MGM edition of the movie, and found it to be generally superior to Criterion. I do not know if I'm just unhappy and I got a bad copy of the movie, but I'll send it back to Amazon and stick with my copy of MGM. Issues to note: The Criterion edition, although sharper, has a very irregular color transfer, excessively bright in some places and some discolouration in others. There are no captions on the Criterion DVD, but the MGM version contains them in multiple languages. I noticed that in various parts of the movie the color comes in and out, and the backgrounds appear erased, as if the film had been colored. As I mentioned, please do not personally attack me for this review. If your copy of this movie is better than the one I wrote then it is good for you. I will still return the DVD to Amazon and leave it like this. This is just the opinion of one man.""",0
"b""I'll be brief and to the point. This DVD remastering is fantastic. You can see the pores of his skin, the follicles of his hair. The sound is beautiful.

Well done and enjoy!""",1
"b""I'm not a big fan of Ben Affleck or anything, but I thought this was a fun movie with an original story. I have difficulty understanding the really low comments others have given. Certainly I did not expect him to bring Oscar nominations, but it was enjoyable. I rarely write reviews, but the negative reviews compelled me to add my opinion. This should be one of those love or hate movies, because the rating on Amazon is in line with other places, including the IMDB.""",1
"b""This is one of my favorite movies. Its quality is typical of what I have expected from a rebuilding of the Criterion. Something along the lines of black and white HDTV. That's nice. The story itself is situated at the beginning of the Great Patriotic War of Russia (WWII). The story covers every inch of human behavior, including happiness, love, sadness, deception, manipulation, and heroism against all odds. The last quarter of the film is an amazing surprise, as it is based on a final scene that is nothing less than a great tribute to what makes us human. Even fans of hardcore war movies (like me) can expect blurred vision at the end of this movie. Not at all sappy, this movie will hit the viewers of any country and most generations. It is not a single display disk. I do not even know if there is a soundtrack in English, since the tone of the Russian soundtrack combined with the well-produced English subtitles offers a great connection to the film even for non-Russian speakers. Buy this disc, you will have more and more fun.""",1
"b""This movie has been one of my favorites since I first watched it as a kid. The dialogue, rhythm, humor and music made the package complete for me.

I'd like to know about the new soundtrack before buying this edition. Although it may work for those who have just discovered this movie, it falls flat on the face of this fan.""",0
"b""This DVD is an interesting collection of interviews and reports. That's what you'd expect. You'll see a young Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill.

I did not know what to expect when I bought this, but I was not totally disappointed. The Star Wars fan will love it, but the general public ... can get bored. There are no DVD Extras of note as well.""",0

"b'Spoilers ahead, but again, who is not familiar with Casablanca, even if he has not seen it? I have been to \'Casablanca\' several times since I bought the Special Edition DVD, and is there a movie out there that you can watch over and over without ever getting tired of it? And does any movie appeal to a wider audience? Just about everything seems to be as close to perfection as it can be. But what exactly is so special about it? Is it your great mix of genres, never matched by another movie? When we think of \'Casablanca\' first, we remember it as a romantic movie (well, most of us). But again, it\'s also a drama involving terror, murder, and flight. One can call this character study, focusing on Rick. And there are a few moments of comic delight, just think of the pickpocket (""This place is full of vultures, vultures everywhere!"") Or the elderly couple the last night before their emigration to the US (""What to watch \'\'.). But \'Casablanca\' is not only great overall, it\'s still at the top if we break it down and look at simple lines of dialogue, scenes or performances by themselves. Is there any other film that has a more quoteable dialogue? that \'Casablanca\'? \'Pulp Fiction\' is on my mind here, and \'All About Eve\' and \'Sunset Blvd.\' Come close too, but I still think \'Casablanca\' is at the top of everything. just the great dialogue, is inexhaustibly delivered, especially by Humphrey Bogart (""I was misinformed"") and Claude Rains (""I\'m shocked, shocked to discover that the game is going on here."") Many of the scenes have become part of the Die Wacht am Rhein \'and\' La Marseillaise \'is probably and one of the biggest scenes ever filmed (the only one I can think of that would rival him for the first place is Hynkel and Chaplin\'s world). Great Dictator \'), and the last scene is probably familiar to the few people who have never seen\' Casablanca \'. Am I the only one who is absolutely convinced that the movie would not have become what it is today if Rick and Ilsa had ended up as the lucky couple? On the performances: Much has been said about the uniqueness of the chemistry of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman as Rick and Ilsa, about the incredible turn of Claude Rains as Renault, about the performances of stealing the scene of Peter Lorre (one of the 10 greatest actors of all time) like Ugarte and Sydney Greenstreet like Ferrari and about Dooley Wilson stopping the show like Sam. I would love to emphasize here two other performances, one that is not mentioned so many times and one that is shamelessly ignored: Conrad Veidt as Major Strasser had a really difficult task here, since his character is the only evil but yet Strasser is not a character and it took more than 50 years until another actor gave a similar (perhaps even more) impressive performance than a Nazi, Ralph Fiennes on Schindler\'s List. But why does no one mention S. K. Sakall, who plays Carl, the cheery waiter at Rick\'s Caf? I am Ricain is beyond me. He definitely has more time on the screen than Lorre, Greenstreet and Wilson, and probably as much as Veidt, and he\'s a joy whenever he\'s on the screen. I simply love his reaction when the ""Vultures everywhere!"" Accidentally comes up against him, or the reaction to the ""What watch"" dialogue. Or as he says he gave Strasser the best table, ""being a German, he would have taken it anyway."" His performance is simply forgotten criminally. So, is there a weaker link in \'Casablanca\'? Each film, no matter how close to perfection, has a small flaw or two, so one can find them in \'Casablanca\' too if one really strives. So, yes, one might ask how much sense all the nonsense about the traffic bills does. It may be noted that Paul Henreid, though his performance is certainly good, does not come close to the grandeur of any of his co-stars. However, the film is so close to perfection that I\'m almost embarrassed to be desperately trying to find less than perfect elements. So any movies that will come, how many sequences will overflow on the screen, and how much trash we\'ll have to sit, one thing is certain if we\'re desperate to see a great movie: we\'ll always have Casablanca!'",1
"b'First, let me say that I loved the movie. I loved it so much I bought a digital copy to download and continue on my Kindle Fire. The problem came when, according to Amazon technology help, DreamWorks decided they were not selling enough in the DVD area, and blocked that from streaming content in what they called the blackout period. Which, in turn, caused Amazon to remove my purchased copy from my Kindle and block me from the streaming version. Amazon returned my money, but it left me very wary of future digital purchases. Just a warning for any purchase of Dreamworks digital movies.'",0
"b""This is the first Star Trek movie where people of the next generation are introduced. Also some of the original characters are involved. That's where it starts to go down.

However, they turn the 1701-D into a weak ship, causing it to be attacked by a single blow (not even a salvo, actually). from an obsolete wessel, delapidated bird of prey / Klingon scout class (as Chekov would have called) who was flawed while on duty. I realize they wanted a known set, but she should have died more. And Admiral Kirk's death was not enough to do him justice. This was supposed to be a transition film, but the first generation, though it did not come out with a moan, certainly did not leave with a bang. It was more like a moan.""",0
"b""Dumbo is a classic Disney movie, which is iconic in its images of pink elephants and the poor elephant with ears too big to fit into the elephant society. This is a very sad and bittersweet film as Dumbo is removed from his mother who yearns for his lost son. Dumbo has to find his own identity and find a way to not get caught up at all times. Originally released in 1941, Dumbo is 63 minutes long. The special features of Big Top Edition far outweigh the feature itself. There is a game that teaches kids about circus animals, a storybook, two sing longs, a music video, several Disney short films. Outside the comment trail and shorts, little here is of value or interest to the adult. The real problem with this new edition of `` Big Top '' is that it is not significantly different from `` 60th Anniversary Edition ''. There is a different video clip, the addition of one feature and the loss of others. The quality of the film itself is not dramatically different from the previous version. Honestly, Dumbo is a Disney movie that's worth having. But it does not matter which issue a purchase. Joe Sherry""",1
"b""It is an absolute waste of Travolta's talent, although he did a good performance, the plot is very predictable, repeated and lame.

"b'Mike Leigh\'s films are all improvisational; almost all are interesting. They are usually Oscar darlings, and ""Vera Drake"" is no exception. I did not mention the plot, because if you\'re reading this, you already know. Imelda Staunton is, in fact, magnificent. I\'ve only recently seen the movie, and by the time of the Oscars last year I thought she\'d win, because of the slug fest that seems to involve Swank & Bening, the only times they\'ve been involved. I thought the votes would be divided, as it often does. Imelda was graceful, glorious, sweet and realistic in this performance, a true amalgam of feat in action. Mike Leigh also used Brenda Blethyn to take advantage of ""Secrets & Lies"". A fantastic story and an interesting part of the story, this movie is wonderful, especially in relation to the other characters involved, all excellent. Mr. Leigh is brilliant and uses feminine characters well; I hope he will soon move away from this improvisational tool that requires women to whine and cry. Imelda\'s whimpers were annoying, but in ""Secrets & Lies,"" Blethyn distracted. Still, a wonderful showing of acting, and about a good person with good intentions who were, unfortunately, against the law. I am pro-life to some extent; I almost understood Vera\'s motives, especially in relation to rape. In the early 1950s, frivolous behavior was not as accepted as it was now, and Vera was there to be a friend. The movie is worth watching. Its historical importance in perspective is invaluable. The family was made to be so important. That\'s nice .'",1

"b'Sites that track positive and negative critics of top critics record a positive rating of at least 95 percent for Ratatouille, putting it clearly at the top of the 2007 films. Is it the best movie of the year? No, but it is the one that has the biggest appeal, since almost everyone will consider it a positive experience. Ratatouille follows Remy, a curious rat who aspires to be more than a thief. The keen sense of smell and appreciation for Remy\'s food lure him into the culinary arts. By stealing what he can from an appreciation of elderly owners for cooking programs and books, Remy becomes a devotee of one of France\'s most famous chefs, Auguste Gusteau. After Remy discovers that Gusteau died years ago and he was watching reruns of his television show, the mouse begins to be guided by Ben Kenobi by the spirit of the dead chef. Following the spirit eventually leads him to the old restaurant of Gusteau, which was taken over by an artless capitalist who uses the image of Gusteau to sell frozen burritos and corndogs. By using a young kitchen worker as a medium, Remy attempts to rebuild Gusteau\'s reputation and return his restaurant to his glory. The resulting action is an often charming tale of a mouse that is dedicated as much to meet as to reach its goal. Many laughs are found when his family comes looking for handouts, and the main antagonists (the owner and a food critic) create real dramatic moments of danger. Remy is truly a ""hero"" movie, someone dedicated to a cause that he believes will make the world a better place. Despite not having the heart of the Toy Story movies or the comedic brilliance of the first Shrek, Ratatouille continues the trend of revival of animation that provided some of the best films of the last decade.'",1

"b'Originally released for Christmas in 1935, this splendidly produced, atmospheric and magnificently acclaimed film showed the M-G-M\'s talent for filming literary classics - DAVID COPPERFIELD was released earlier that year - without cost savings; The assault on the Bastille sequel employed thousands of extras and was filmed on one of the biggest Hollywood sets of all time. Ronald Colman was initially reluctant to play the role of Sidney Carlton, that charming but dissolute lawyer who commits the ultimate self - sacrifice ... ... It took a lot of persuasion to make Colman shave his trademark mustache for the role of Carlton, but he delivered more than likely his best performance. (Later in his life, Colman admitted that this was his favorite of all his roles.) Charles Dicken\'s seething 17th-century classic of Paris and London and the events surrounding the French Revolution were filmed as silences on four different occasions - twice in Britain and America - and this remains the definitive masterpiece. Under the meticulous direction of Jack Conway, TALE OF TWO CITIES offers memorable performances from an outstanding cast including the wonderful Hammie Blanche Yurka, the scary Lucille LaVerne, the Edna May Oliver Vinegar, the despicable Basil Rathbone, the eloquent Henry B Walthall (he was the ""Little Colonel"" in BIRTH OF A NATION) and, in a radical change of pace, the tiny Isabel Jewell, as the pathetic seamstress who accompanies Colman to the place of his execution.'",1

His early albums mesmerized me and I\'ve never been without an incarnation of the top three ever since, whether LP or CD. When LORCA left I went with it to some extent, but I admit that I totally lost the thread from where Buckley was going through STARSAILOR. This DVD, which features a very good range of clips throughout his career, gives a new appreciation to all phases of an artist who pushed hard the creative envelope (achieving a quasi-commercial suicide in the attempt). When I watched the performances of the later era, I felt guilty for abandoning Buckley in its later stages, but it takes a maturity to appreciate this material that I did not have at the time.

"b'What can I say about this uninspired ""account"" of Bret\'s first novel? The film adaptation does not contain the scenes and the tone I thought made the book so scary and memorable. (The dead boy in the alley scene, the snuff movie with the underage girl ...) This movie really can not be claimed that it\'s based on the book - it\'s more that it\'s inspired by the novel. Despite this downfall, it\'s worth watching the movie for any fan of Bret Easton Ellis - even if it\'s to satisfy someone\'s curiosity. The film does not contain the one-sided phrases or the small characters that make the book so interesting and engaging (Sisters of Clay, Spin) The movie made it seem like Julian was the protagonist while I always felt the novel was about seeing the events unfolding through Clay\'s eyes. One of the most engaging parts of the novel is Clay\'s flashbacks of a better time before he goes to school. The film only talks about it at first, and the flashback is about Blair, not about his parents, who were the flashbacks I found most interesting. The lunch scene between Clay and his father is pure genius. The distance between father and son made me shudder physically. This scene is not included in the movie. The unfortunate thing about adapting movies from books is that you almost always miss something in the \'translation\'. \'American Psycho\' is really the only one of the films adapted from his books that I feel captures the tone of the book while simultaneously the compact in a watchable narrative without losing the style of Bret, and this is due to the fact that Bateman himself is the storyteller. Everyone and everyone, \'Less Than Zero\' is not a bad movie, actually. Just a bad adaptation. It captures what was both incredible and forgettable about the popular 1980s movie, and fits into any teenage drama of the era (including the extravagant use of cocaine by minors, New Wave, the future star of Where Are They? Now, James Spader). There are some exciting moments, but it seems that the film tried to find a conclusion that the book did not (and had a reason not to). After all, Julian does not die in the novel, and Blair certainly does not return to Camden with Clay (Morrissey would not be proud). What is so melancholic about the novel is what the movie did not get. also alludes to: how upset, apathetic, nd lost Clay is now that he has changed and gained a new perspective, while his friends, unfortunately, have not.A serious complaint: Where is the outdoor Disappear Here? It is an integral part of the pictures of the novel, and is absent in the film (unless I have lost it). Everything and everyone: If you are a fan of Bret\'s books, give this movie a chance. Worth watching once, but do not get upset if you hardly try to capture the mood or purpose of the novel.'",0
"b""Excellent GHOST movie works mainly because of f / x and refreshing direction of the horror legend Tobe Hooper. Although a bit of Spielberg is noticing at times, if it were not for the opening credits where they put their name on nearly every credit you could think of, there's no way any Tom, Dick and Harry realize. that he had something to do with this masterpiece. Its rhythm like a roller coaster. It never gets boring from start to finish. This is an honor! Lots of praise for Spielberg for developing such a vivid and imaginative script. Guess what part of JAWS's notoriety disappeared and his head swelled to the size of the Goodyear airship. Anyway, the movie is scary in every respect. Although I was struck by the fact that a film with such blood could somehow get underneath the MPAA's appraisers and achieve a PG rating. Wow . They must have thought ... Hey, if Spielberg has this movie under his belt ... why not try another JAWS! Except this time use Ghosts and Better f / x to improve the monster.

The computer gifted me with magic beyond your dreams. I could get this DVD and do a search for my queen. Queen Azura was played by Beatrice Roberts. The actress was born in Manhattan in 1905. As a young woman, she participated in various beauty contests, including the Miss America. She had a short marriage with Robert Ripley [Believe It or Not], and a long-term relationship with Louis B. Mayer [MGM]. She appeared in a number of B-grade films (perhaps C), often without credits. I still carry a torch for her. In fact she would be as old as my grandmother. On the screen, however, it holds a regal appeal. Beatrice Roberts has finally disappeared into obscurity and is apparently buried in Plymouth, Massachusetts, near my hometown. If I ever find her tomb, I stop and plant violets.""",1

"b'When I came across Across the Universe for the first time, it seemed a bit esoteric, even with the Beatles\' musical pedigree. But from the first minute, when Jim Sturgess sings ""Girl"" - it all makes sense. You have to really respect how well the Beatles\' musical legacy has been entwined in this effort. Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr made some of the best songs of the 20th century and besides being a good movie, Across the Universe really puts that in focus. The power of the songs comes to life at every turn. Vividly imagined with art direction and cinematography, Across the Universe cleverly weaves the Beatles into the socio-political context of the times when the songs were written. Let\'s take the hat off to director Julie Taymor and the crew who clearly found it very well, and the excellent cast that everyone sings better than anyone could expect. This is a great feat considering it could have been complimentary or badly done. The actor Sturgess reminds me of a young Paul McCartney, but that\'s where the resemblance to anything from the Beatles ends. It\'s a shame Across the Universe has not been successful in theaters as well, but I suspect the treatment was very clever. to the audience today. It is a movie that comes from the heart that every fan of the Beatles must watch and the curious about the music can check.'",1
"b'Amazon is still combining movie reviews. There are about half of the dozens of DVD versions of ""The Snows of Kilimanjaro"".

I bought the most expensive `` The Snows of Kilimanjaro (Remastered Edition) \'\' and the quality is terrible. It looks like the movie was shot in a dirty window. The DVD case has a black finish and shows Ava Gardner and Gregoty Peck sitting at a dinner table. Avoid this version! Now I\'m going to try to buy other versions of this movie from Amazon, I\'m hoping to find the only good one. I read all the other reviews and was not able to reliably determine the official release of the studio.

"b'First of all, I want to thank all the reviewers here. It\'s the reviews of this beautiful film that tried to buy me (this and the fact that the director also did ""Breaker Morant"" - one of my favorites). I\'m a big fan of that genre. I loved `` Dances with Wolves \'\' and `` Jeremiah Johnson, \'\' and I really enjoyed `` The Last of the Mohicans \'\' and `` Last of the Dogmen, \'\' but none of these great movies compares with absolute. realism depicted in ""Black Robe"". This is a simple story set in the early seventeenth century ... a story of a French Jesuit priest who was accused by his canoe superiors to an outpost of Huron to 1,500 miles away help of Indian scouts and an interpreter) and help to convert the Huronian Indians to Christianity, thus saving their souls. In this film the protagonist is not a superhero who does not make mistakes, shows no weaknesses, can shoot and leave in any man alive. On the contrary, he is just a young priest full of self-righteousness, ignorance, fear and doubt. But despite this (or because of this), his bravery is truly incomparable. This is a story of real people fighting for their lives every day against the harshness of nature and against other Indian tribes. This is also a story about the confrontation between two very varied cultures. This is shown with an unusual subtlety, but the effects are devastating. `` Black Robe \'\' goes where few movies have gone before, or ever since. It\'s a movie as Oscar-worthy as any I\'ve ever seen. Cinematography is dark, cold, and relentless, as is history. Between 1 and 10, I give this landmark a solid movie 9. It is truly one of my favorites.'",1

b'This is a blatant theft by Amazon playing about the current popularity of Bradley Cooper and hoping that no one will search after the 2 minute preview goes online to learn more about the movie. I later discovered that the film is an indie film that was made in 2002. The worst part was that they charged a HD quality price of $ 4.99 for a low-budget granular film. The protagonist is a young woman who grew up in a carnival where it is normal to create an illusion and rip out the suckers - and that is exactly what I feel happened here!',0
"b""That was the most painful DVD experience I've ever had. The music on the DVD was so stupid that it drowned out everything, making it completely incomprehensible. It was as bad as the music the producer seemed to want in video of himself in almost every scene. Not to mention that almost the entire DVD is made up of collages of images superimposed over each other, leaving none of them clear enough to even see correctly. I bought hundreds of books and DVDs from Amazon and this is the first. this motivated me to post a review. It's so bad. I can not even comment on what the producer said, I could not hear any of it. Stay away would be my advice, a total waste of money.""",0
"b""I like good Asian movies particularly when Takeshi Kaneshiro is in one, but he's not in this movie! I did not see Aaron either. I really would like to read the reviews before buying and from now on, just to make sure the characters are on the movie list. Now who would have thought that was necessary? Of course I could tell by the cover that he would not be the protagonist that was fine with me, but I should have realized that he is not the caliber of the actor who is no longer on the cover. Is it possible that when they say the film is from Takeshi, they mean what he produced? I'm so clueless and irritated with her misleading information that I could almost scream. If they had not lied about the cast I would not have bought it. It is obviously a very badly edited television drama with lots of action, wuxia wire action included, beautiful actors and a somewhat confusing plot. If it's a sequel, I suppose it explains some of the problems because people appear and the main characters know them, but we have no idea who they are or whether they are good or bad, even though we think they should be friends or enemies or both depending of their actions. At one point they are all together as a power rangers forming a giant sword and I have no idea who they were or how Wind even got there working to help the villain. I also did not realize that Wave was Cloud's brother (I think) until much later in the story. It would have been much more emotional if I had known it from the beginning, but maybe because I was so bored it passed through me somehow! ? When the wind becomes a demon, there is no explanation of how long or when it returns to normal or even how. He is with Mung, his wife in one minute and not the other, she adopts a boy and he never sees her again, until it is the tip to warn her inadvertently that the master has a cold back. It's just a miscellany of scenes played together that leave you wondering how he or she did it. I would not recommend this movie. It is filmed more like a soap opera, has that video and is simply edited horribly. I was bored waiting to see when Takeshi would appear thinking that maybe he was the nameless, but I could not even find out who the unspeakable was. Perhaps if they had followed with that, whoever they wanted as the unspeakable, could have punched another punch. A perfect way to waste time.""",0
"b'Lewis Gilbert\'s 1983 masterpiece, a sensitive and emotionally satisfying adaptation of Willy Russel\'s intelligent and insightful two-character set. Gilbert and Russell would team up again for the wonderful & quot; Shirley Valentine, & quot; but their work in this film remains unparalleled. Michael Caine makes one of the most memorable performances of an illustrious career, disappearing into his Frank character, and Julie Walters is magnificent as Rita / Susan. David Hentschel\'s music is perfectly appropriate, Frank Watts\'s cinematography is inspired, the script is both touching and honest, but the magic of this film lies in the interaction between the two main characters. This film captures the journey towards self-consciousness embedded in education, as the character Rita / Susan develops from hairdresser to student, intellectual, dilitante and, finally, in someone very different than at the beginning of the film, but still undeniably and solely ""Rita ""The greatest gift one person can give to another is the love of learning, and so I feel this is one of the greatest love stories ever made for celluloid.The ending may be"" as inevitable as tragedy, ""in the words of Willy Russel, but the relationship between Frank and Rita has made their emotional journey worthwhile, and we are all richer for their journey.'",1
"b""If Daniel Barenboim is not the greatest living classical musician in the world, he is certainly the most versatile. In a career spanning more than 50 years, his name is linked to many of the celebrated recordings of opera, symphony, small ensemble and piano solo. With the later half of his career marked by the distinction on the podium, it may be forgotten that he is still an accomplished concert pianist. Here we are treated with both talents as Barenboim leads to Staatskapelle Berlin and plays all five Beethoven piano concerts. From the accompanying booklet, we find that Barenboim recorded these works for the first time in 1967 at the age of twenty-four, under Otto Klemperer. Now he is revisiting them 40 years later, on the occasion of his 65th birthday. The challenges of serving as conductor and soloist are undoubtedly considerable, but Barenboim, acting entirely from memory and without punctuation, makes it look easy and natural. Even when fully engaged in his role as a soloist, Barenboim never loses control of the orchestra. Sometimes his direction is in the momentary freedom of a broad gesture from his left hand. At other times, it is the subtlety of his nod or the quickness of his eyes. The Staatskapelle is perfectly attuned to these nuances and their game is always on time and never hesitant. Among the many highlights: the wonderful interchange between piano and clarinet in the Largo of the first concert, an exciting account of Rondo Vivace in the final movement. the room and all the beauty and majesty of the Emperor. The performance was recorded before a live audience during a three-day piano festival in Bochum, Germany, in 2007. The concerts took place at the Jahrhunderthalle, which features an architectural design of a converted steel mill. The minimalist interior, with high ceiling and exposed steel beams, renounces the traditional elegance that adorns many concert halls (and the false pretense that accompanies it). Aesthetically, the Jahrhunderthalle is a place that emphasizes comfort and clean lines of vision above all else. The exhausted audience is appreciative and respectful of music. They are often viewed, but rarely heard (even between movements) until the applause at the end of each job. They are smart (if not formally) dressed people who know good classical music when they hear it. Some of the presentations happened during the day allowing the large back windows to project stunning natural light to the audience as well as to the performers. illuminated even more by the soft lighting of the stage that highlights the musicians and their instruments when necessary and without shadows. The Blu-ray 1080i picture is almost perfect. The skin tones are natural and attractive. The color of the instruments and the suit of the audience are precise without bleeding. The ivory keyboard is properly exposed and balanced with great resolution to see the distinction between the keys. The black levels are strong without losing any detail in the folds of the musicians. Close-ups reveal the polished brass of the French horns as well as the fine grain on the bass and violins. Barenboim is appropriately the center of attention and we can see the delicate strands of his hair and the beads of sweat that begin to shine on his forehead by the third movement of each concert. The PCM 2.0 audio track is clean, but the piano sounds a little. in contrast to the high C. In contrast, the DTS HD-MA 5.1 range, opening the rear channel environment and a wider sound stage, provides a beautiful sound that is warm and spacious and devoid of any mismatch in the upper register. The piano is properly centered, while the sound integrity of each orchestral instrument is presented with distinction according to its location on the stage. The full program runs at approximately 3:20. There are no supplements except some trailers from other Medici Arts releases. An interview with Barenboim, some rehearsal footage and a brief history of the place would have been good, but unfortunately the opportunities were missed. In the end, it's the only thing missing, because it is, in any case, a very welcome release and another great achievement for one of the most distinguished artists of classical music.""",1

"b'This is an unusual Merchant / Ivory film that focuses on the Indian community of Trinidad from 1943 to about 1954. It focuses in particular on a young teacher who takes a wife, outwits her cunning and greedy father and lives in the countryside , just wanting to write books. Still, he has to make a living, so he becomes a masseuse, who is not a masseur, but a healer. He also writes books about Hinduism, which he publishes himself. He becomes known as the Mystic Masseuse and develops a great repercussion throughout the country. His book and the books that follow are quickly bought by a now worshiped audience that reveres him as a Pundit. A brief career in politics soon follows, only for him to discover that a public he loves can become fickle. The film snakes, as does the life of this scholar. With top-notch cinematography and stellar performances from the entire cast, this is a very good movie, though unusual. Those who are interested in other cultures will find this film of some interest. If you are not so inclined, deduce a star from my review.'",1
"b'I admit I\'ve never seen Mario Bava movies. I just recently joined the Italian cinema with the films of Dario Argento and other Giallo took my interest. So far I\'ve never tried any Bava. So by listening to this movie and being intrigued by the premise, I got the DVD. The premise of the film is that four criminals steal a payroll from pharmaceutical companies during which the escape driver is killed. The three remaining killers flee to a parking lot taking hostages, one of whom they kill to escape. Then, in order not to be seen by the police in a family car, they remove more hostages and this time a middle-aged man and a sick child. At this point, the films were a violent crime film. When it enters the car, the film is basically centered in the movement of the criminals and their hostages. What is good about the film despite the minor flaws is that even in its form (neither Rabid Dogs nor the reissued Kidnapped was completed with Bava\'s support due to circumstances that gained their ""lost"" status until recently), it is actually a very good thriller of mounted suspense building its tension slowly. As the tensions in the car increase and victims plead for their lives, even the criminals begin to turn against each other. One wants to rape the woman as a hostage, while another goes along with what happens while the leader is more concerned about just reaching his destination. There are moments in the movie that to me have been great, in a transgressive way, that the latest movies do not even come close to the top. And in the end, I do not want to ruin this, but if you get into the plot as much as I do, it will definitely amaze you. I was totally impressed with the movie. One thing is also the feeling of anger that infiltrates every picture. This is a brutal movie to watch at times with your portrayal of a world that is arrogant and rather brutal in considering the situation of the hostages (especially the child). For me, it\'s a film that can almost be compared to one of my favorites, Kurosawa\'s Ran. Unfortunately I only saw the cut Rabid Dogs on the new album from Anchor Bay. It also contains the version of Lamberto Bava Kidnapped more according to the intentions of his father, which I will watch in the future, but was deactivated for the soundtrack of the synthesizer (I love the harpsichord and organs playing in Rabid Dogs, despite admitting that the score is incessant) and did not want to watch the film as soon after seeing it. This is still a definite recommendation from me, worth seeing.'",1
"b""Being a huge vampire / horror fan and a fan of Bloodrayne video games, I decided to give this movie a whirlwind. All I can say is there. The action scenes are laughable. The actors move in slow motion as if they have no coordination. I'm guessing this is due to a low budget fight choreographer. And the blood! This movie has to have the fluffiest look of blood I've ever seen ... Difficult I'm giving this movie two stars for its violence. The beheadings and such are so exaggerated and 'funny' looking like they are beyond comic. Think Kill Bill multiplied 20 times ... In short, this is a very 'bad' movie from start to finish. There is virtually nothing in this that I would recommend.""",0
"b'As many critics say, this is definitely a lightweight, irresistible, funny and simply wonderful movie to watch. No sex, no violence, just a funny story about a salaried man who thinks dancing is the key to freeing himself from his bored existence. The music soundtrack was simply wonderful - every song matched perfectly with every scene. I was fortunate to get a copy of the soundtrack during a trip abroad. Anyway, I found the plot much more engaging and clever than your normal Hollywood movies. Instead of having Sugiyama fall in love with the original girl who brought him to the dance hall, he discovers the pure joy of dancing and his liberating power that brought him closer to his family, encouraging him to show his affection and love more openly and directly . No clich\xc3\xa9s or well-used plots, just a beautiful story.'",1
"b'While it is true that the once-brilliant ""Soap"" suffers major creative terminal problems in its fourth and final season (why Burt is suddenly the holiest member of the family?), He overcomes virtually every comedy in the air nowadays. his daring mix of comedy, drama, romance, suspense and pathos.

No show today comes close to the ""Soap,"" even in this weaker season. What Sony did with the fourth season is shocking and a mystery. Although their presentations from the first to the fourth period have been technically unnoticed, many of them due to sources, at least the episodes remained intact and were presented as they were originally on ABC and the VHS series release by Columbia House in the 1990s ""For some reason, Sony chose to edit the fourth season of` `Soap \'\' by cutting most of the pre-episode recaps (` `In the last episode of \'Soap\' ...` `), some of which were quite smart and none of which consumed more than 40 seconds or more. Worse still, Sony edited the last five one-hour episodes of the season in ten and a half hours, omitting entire scenes and essentially including syndicated versions of the opening portion of the show. (I do not know if these are in fact syndicated versions of these episodes, but they are significantly different from the episodes that appeared on the Columbia House tapes, which featured entire episodes when they appeared on ABC in 1981). full and complete versions of Seasons 1-3, this incomplete and poor season 4 pack is a puzzle, a disappointment and of value only to fans who just need to have the entire series on DVD.

It's more of a movie about a woman who does not get along with her mother, is popular on her radio talk show, and her marriage is in trouble.

The workout is divided into 5 segments of 10 minutes which is a format that I love as it means that you can divide it for a shorter workout and even if you do the whole thing it does not feel like an eternity because of the change segments. The general idea is to do strengthening exercises followed by stretches to lengthen the muscles. Overview of segments: Arms: This was probably my least favorite segment. I prefer the arm segment in 10 minute pilates perfect body solutions. There were about 6-7 minutes of arms work and then 3-4 stretching of the arms. He felt rushed and the signal seemed a little wrong. Besides, I did not find it too difficult. For this segment, you need light hand weights. Thighs: This segment was excellent. They claim that you need a chair to do these exercises, however, if you have reasonably strong thighs and good balance, it is not necessary. These exercises make you feel your thighs, mine started to tremble like crazy at one point and are really effective. Glutes: I think this was the hardest segment on the DVD. I really like that they have a segment especially dedicated to buttocks, much video through them with thighs and I do not think they work too hard. In this segment, the glutes will work hard and a chair is an absolute necessity. I've had to do several breaks during this, but I'm looking forward to working up the complete segment.Abs: I'm glad that this segment was short because despite having been good work for the abs, it was a bit annoying. You put your feet on the wall and sit in a sitting position (do not you think that sounds difficult? I have not tried it for about 8 minutes) and then I make variations from there. It's not my favorite ab workout, but effective, I definitely felt my abdomen overwork. Stretch: I really like when DVDs have a specific long stretch dedicated to stretching. That being said, this was not my favorite stretch segment. I wish the passages had been kept a little less long and there were more different passages. It was over and I still felt the need to do some other stretches to really feel stretched out. But the stretches they did were good, and there is something to be said to keep them for so long and really make your body relax in stretching. Overall, I would definitely recommend buying this video. It's a very effective exercise and I certainly enjoyed all the segments enough to keep doing, even if they were not my favorites. I also really enjoyed having two instructors, one man and one woman, and they showed simpler variations on many of the movements, including when it was best to rest if you needed to. One con I have not mentioned yet (and this is a personal preference thing) is that the instruction is voice-over, which is not my favorite and sometimes I felt like the cueing was not right. Final thoughts: for $ 15 it's worth it!""",1
"b'Every year as a child I expected to see Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer, during the holidays. In fact, I was eager to see it on TV even as an adult! Wanting to share this great classic with my 7 year old son, I bought it for him a few weeks ago. Of course, I had recorded on a VHS along with other Christmas classics, but the quality was not so good and we had to endure commercials. The DVD version seems to be clean from the TV version in terms of quality. I remember more background fuzzies when I was on TV (maybe the DVD was remastered?) Desinty\'s Child\'s claymation video is basically useless, in my opinion, unless you have a little fan of that kind. of music (and I do not). With a run time of 65 minutes, this DVD has almost no extras. There\'s a lost scene that originally aired in place of the song ""Why Am I Such Misfit?"" \'\' (an optimistic tone about eliminating and finding his fortune). You can also watch the DVD in Spanish, and my son has fun doing it once in a while. The `` previews \'\' of other DVD\'s - including an annoying promo for one on Peter Rabbit / Easter - seems endless. It\'s a shame that they advertise to death on DVD\'s for young people! And as far as Rudolph\'s story goes: well, I\'ve always been bothered because Rudolph\'s father rejected him for being different - just like Santa Claus himself! Very disappointing, but it\'s not like life - where do people judge on the basis of appearances? Still, I love Rudolph\'s songs, the Red Nose Reindeer, and Hermie, the dentist, Yukon Cornelius and Bumble bring festive nostalgia to our house. And my 7-year-old son plays this DVD at least once a day! What else can you ask for ? (except maybe some fun extras).'",1
"b'After the first year of college, the class meets to relax and have fun. After a party in Stiflers, which almost looks like the first movie, the gang decides to take their adventures to a beach house and spend the summer there. While they are trying to find work and partying on the beach, the boys have some of their own dilemmas they have to deal with. Jim discovers that Nadia is back in the United States after she was expelled from them after the internet disaster. Jim only had sex once and a half since that incident. So, to try to prepare for Nadia, he has the help of Michelle, the band nerd that rocked his world a year ago. As she begins to teach him the ways of sexual behavior, they themselves begin to realize that they may be more than they think they are to each other. Kevin, after separating himself from Vicky, has to overcome his feelings for her once she shows up in the house to have fun. Because to her, they are just friends, and that is why she now has a new boy in her life. Oz has to deal with a long-distance relationship with Heather since she left for the summer. It does not help, however, that his best friend Stifler is constantly trying to get him to have sex with any girl within a three meter radius of them. Speaking of Stifler, he\'s still dealing with the fact that Finch had sex with his mother last year. And Finch is having withdrawals from not being with Stifler\'s mother. For a long time I thought Part 1 was the best of them. I seriously think I\'ve been wrong all this time. After watching it back back last night, I can honestly say that I laughed a lot more with Part 2. The jokes are better and even bolder. The constraints that Jim goes through are hilarious (good God, the super glue scene). The girls are hotter. And choke maybe just a little over the top, but still much better in part 2. When he grabs the vibrator and shakes it while running through the house, I can not stop laughing. And when he says he forgot where he found it, because of all the excitement of when he thought it was just hilarious. The lesbian scene was just laughing out loud funny as well. In the end, I definitely would own it. Just remember, though, if you\'re not into sassy comedy, just stay away.P.S.

"b""Alice Walker is a great pioneer. She is one of those African-American women who deserves all our love and adoration. She explores in this film, and behind it in the book, the slow and progressive liberation of black women from their auxiliary slavery. Everything must start in their heads. They must find the courage to develop their own personalities and freedom in the closed chain of their skulls, and then, little by little, they find the strength and power to resist men, and then society, and then stand out. Liberatiion is a mental process that finds its full power when it becomes public and looks at society as the natural field of its achievement. The film is touching, poignant, sensitive, intelligent, sentimental and tremendously powerful, if it is not yet pregnant with the most universal language we can imagine, the language of women's liberation seen as the first step of the liberation of humanity. Alice Walker is universal in this story and deals with the whole world and with all humans. What's more, no one is lost, no one is left on the side of the road, no one is wasted forever with the cause of liberation. Even the worst tyrant will discover in his moral depth the idea and initiative that will make him free along with others, along with those he or she has taught for decades. The husband pays for the immigration of his wife's sister's husband and African family. And he does it for nothing, because he stays on the side and does not claim what he deserves.

"b'First, I have to clean up. I first saw the Full Metal Jacket in its original movie release. About all that was left with me was the scene in the head that ends the second third of the movie. I bought it at the recommendation of my son, a second lieutenant newly commissioned from the Marines. He calls the FMJ ""Marine Film"". He also calls the time period a shameful chapter in the history of the Marine Corps. ""The routine abuse of recruits described in the film does not happen anymore. Even so, the film hits in both ways. Maritime training, even thirty years later, is as demanding as Kubrick portrays. It has the same goal: the creation of ""indestructible men (and now women)"" who can kill as many enemies as possible. The experience of the Marines in combat, especially in Vietnam, is as the film demonstrates. By undergoing training that will qualify you to lead a platoon, I asked my son about the incident that led to the second cold-blooded murder. Could it have happened that the Marines would become so lost that they would be at the mercy of a sniper? Absolutely, he replied, adding that Marines see the prospect of urban warfare with anxiety: ""There are an infinite number of places where the enemy could be. ""In addition, he said, Cowboy made the right choice, although it resulted in the deaths of three Marines. Even though I was on the streets in a different way during Vietnam (and could not have seen the fight anyway - I\'m blind in my right eye and right handed), I\'m convinced Semper Fi is real. ""Semper Fi, do or die, gung ho, gung, ho, gung ho."" The Marines are in fact the best we have, the inspiration for the Army and Delta Force Rangers and the Navy SEALS. the bar in ways I did not enjoy. Run, do not walk, to see this movie.'",1

"b'No one can soak a book in a frightening, muffled atmosphere like Neil Gaiman, infused with humor and more than a little horror. Fortunately, this flavor is kept alive in the film adaptation of ""Coraline"", brought to life by the talented Henry Selick. It\'s a scary little fairy tale full of decadent apartments, dancing mice and soulless doppelgangers, as well as a brave heroine who finds herself in this ""other"" sinister world. Newly moved to an old apartment, Coraline (Dakota Fanning) is bored . Her parents are too busy to do anything with her, and her neighbors are crazy or boring. The only exception is Wybie, a boy who irritates her endlessly. It\'s the relentlessly tedious kind of world any little girl would want to escape-to Coraline. She finds a towed door and a wormhole colored, leading to a new home. In fact, it is so similar that she has a ""other mother"" with button eyes (Teri Hatcher) and another ""father"" (John Hodgman), plus good food, games, a glittering magical garden. , a choir of circus rodents and magical toys. At first Coraline is fascinated by the other world, especially since her other parents are as attentive as their true ones are not. Then she finds her true parents sealed inside a mirror. With the help of a sarcastic cat, Coraline ventures back into the next world. But with her parents and a trio of dead children held hostage, Coraline\'s only hope is to bet on her own freedom - and she\'ll be stuck forever if she fails. Neil Gaiman\'s book ""Coraline"" is a brilliant, dark fairy tale vibration - decadent apartments, dead children, cobwebs, beetles, hands without body, button eyes and a woman with insect button eyes that wants to claim Coraline for herself. It\'s a fairy tale world that turns into a nightmare realm where souls are lost and horrible things hide in the shadows. Most directors would turn the story into a courteous and shameless affair ... but not the director of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" ""and"" James and the giant peach. ""Instead, Selick gives a dark atmosphere full of cobwebs, bright colors and surreal details (the button eclipsing the moon). And it\'s full of charming details that could have been silly (the scary claw), but they work brilliantly. The story begins as merely surreal, but it becomes more ghastly and sinister as the film unfolds - and in the last third, the slow story suddenly turns into a completely scary territory, and a truly terrifying climax, where the Other Mother shows her true self. And along the way, there are plenty of wonderfully scary moments - the three ghosts in a rotten bedroom / mirror, the supply of knobs and thick black wire, strange circus acts and more. The horror is subtle, the delicious shiver is not.Coralina - Alice in this Notsowonderland - is a wonderful little heroine: strong, sensible, self-sufficient but still quite frightened by what is happening around her. Normally I\'m not crazy about Dakota Fanning, but only with voice is she very good at this role. The sarcastic cat is a wonderful counterpoint, and the original character of the movie, Wybie, makes a good (though odd) companion. And the other mother is the stuff of nightmares - she\'s totally inhuman and ruthless, and by the climax of the movie she becomes a nightmare. Oh, and French and Saunders make a couple of funny appearances like crazy neighbors. `` Coraline \'\' is a brilliantly dark little movie full of dark magic and strange creatures - definitely for Gaiman fans, somber fantasies and really scary stuff.'",1
"b""In my review of the Fallen album I quoted Lemmy of Motorhead saying that the album was above and beyond the call of duty. The rest of the quote was that he felt he could not do it live. Well, I have to disagree with Mr. Kilminster as having seen the 'World Domination' tour on his Australian leg, I have to say the band sounded good. And this CD shows that they can really fill the sound mix as well as in their groundbreaking album. This is actually a bit of no frills in terms of audio. The sound is good, the band is fine, which is interesting, considering the personal dramas of the time. The noise of the crowd seems to have been gradual and gradual, although this is a fairly regular situation. The main difference between these Fallen songs and their live versions here is that the sound sounds a little empty. This really is a lucrative job in your fame. Putting a live album when you have no catalog back is a bit cheeky. It also fills the gap between the albums - the aforementioned staff revolts undoubtedly played their part. Not that filling the time between albums with live releases and curiosities is a new idea (G'n'R Lies, anyone?). For fans of this band, this is probably an essential listening. The songs sound good, the audience is adoring and they are a nice project. Three stars for the strength of the songs and because there did not seem to be massive overdubs. The fourth star of the extra DVD that shows the band putting in value. They also sold the DVD separately for some time. Be sure to get this version with the DVD already present as it is worth viewing.""",1
"b""4.6 stars I love this movie, and I think both the script and Ford do justice to the original and justifiably beloved TV series. I do not think this blu-ray transfer does much justice to the original impression; Although it is a good and clear image, it is not a big improvement over my DVD. The film itself is an excellent adaptation of the series, and Big Pharma's conspiracy angle is an excellent update that works well. There are thrills in abundance, with a minimum of violence, which I enjoy most every year, when idiot directors and writers rely on guns and blood to fill the holes in their ill-conceived conspiracies. There is more intelligence than this at work here, and director Andrew Davis does everything in a firm and suspenseful way. The ending is a bit weak: I do not buy the scene at the conference, but it works to the extent it should, and that's good enough. Add Ford and Jones at the top of their games and it's a movie worth watching many times, whenever someone needs to be reminded of what a truly good thriller can be. It's too bad they have not prepared it enough for it to be a blu-ray worthy of the description in high definition.""",1
"b'The problem with New Moon is that it takes itself very seriously while giving the public many reasons to consider it a joke. I try not to read much in movies, and I believe that individuals are responsible for their own actions, but I agree that this film has influence on girls, and yes, older women as well. I was in the gym once, and a lot of the dialogue reminded me of what I remember hearing from boyfriends and girlfriends. You know, the day you had a great passion and they were the love of your life? Then, 3 weeks later, you move on to another ""love of your life"". ""That\'s how the dialogue sounds. It\'s extravagant, exaggerated, and I\'m sorry for teenagers who think this is what it should be. Edward and Bella have an obsessive and codependent relationship. Discharged by a vampire, so you\'re feeling suicidal? Same ? If you take things from vampire, everything else is still wrong. Bella is an imbecile girl, without emotion, without humor, without notion, completely empty of personality. It\'s very difficult to understand why these guys find her attractive. What does she do ? For her or for someone else? She\'s a big jerk and she treats her father like crap. It\'s simply not credible that two guys are willing to die (one again) for it. She offers nothing in return. She is abandoned by Ed and only consumes the attention that Jacob gives her, with no intention of never repaying her feelings. We call it leadership. Everything is about her to the fullest. What I find particularly amusing is that she asks Jacob if he could just stop being a wolf ... but that same girl would never ask Edward that. It makes no sense . Lautner did the best acting of the three and made me feel for Jake. I read the Wiki page for the book Breaking Dawn and the result for your character sounds like a movie recipe for disaster. At this point, producers need to stop leading girls. He honestly saved the movie. As an adult, I can only deal with so much teen angst and the fact that he broke some smiles prevented me from turning him off. When the werewolf left the forest before chasing Victoria, OK, yes, I thought it was a bear. But still, the werewolf scenes were the best parts. The vampire makeup was terrible and the contacts were distracting. Pattinson was better in the first movie. Stewart was the same non-entity. She was so unreliable. Even if it\'s not in the dialogue, mannerisms, facial expressions and actions can convey a lot about a character. It\'s hard to believe that Bella is not a robot. Even on the DVD cover, it just does not try. Compared with both male leads. Actors must be able to sell the motivations of their characters. Stanley in `Bonde \'was totally reprehensible, but Brando sold it. Stewart does not, and therefore Bella comes out as one of the most unworthy ""heroines"" that have ever appeared on screen. Wow, I will not stop here.'",0
"b""Good movies about & quot; Great War & quot; (as WWI was known before there was a second) are few and far between. Then & quot; All the silence on the western front & quot; and & quot; Paths of Glory the list is very short. This movie does not meet these standards, but it's still an excellent movie. Overall, the film is quite accurate in terms of its description of the World War I combat. Battle scenes come close to & quot; Saving Private Ryan & quot; level of realism as you can get into commercial television. Be warned that some scenes, especially the & quot; friendly fire & quot; artillery attack, are not for scruples. The supporting cast is a colorful and original collection of characters, devoid of most of the clich\xc3\xa9s of usual war films. You can not look at a character and tell him if he would be dead by the end of the movie. It was easy to imagine that these characters had been ripped off a New York street around 1918. Rick Schroeder gives a first-class performance as the deeply conflicted major Whittlesey, torn between performing his duty and the well-being of his men. There are some moments where the movie hits a fake note. Whittlesey's car at first probably was not built for 15 years after the end of the Great War. The scene in which the major receives his orders seems to ignore the military protocol. And in a major flaw of continuity, Whittlesey's executive office talks about the wandering artillery barrage that happened on that day, when it happened the day before. These are just smaller holes in an otherwise first-class effort.""",1
"b""Yes, Keanu Reeves actually plays the villain in this wonderful and magical film of romance, jealousy, romance, betrayal and honor set in Renaissance Italy. Created and starring Kenneth Branagh, this remake of one of Shakespeare's comedies is probably the most enjoyable and entertaining film based on one of the Bard's plays. The cast includes many big names from both sides of the Atlantic, such as Denzel Washington, Emma Thompson and Michael Keaton, and heroine is Kate Beckinsale's first big attraction. The dialogue in the film remains true to the original play and the setting is probably as close as possible to what Shakespeare imagined. The best of all is the music; classic in style, but original in composition. I enjoyed watching this movie several times and so did you.""",1
"b""This DVD has my favorite soundtrack for this movie, however, it is out of sync with the video! (which basically ruins it) Chapter selection is also flawed: there are only 4 chapter selections to choose from; Chapter 2 is labeled Chapter 1, and so on ... so there is no selection for Chapter 1. The title menu is also extremely cheap by showing a small photo of the DVD case cover in a background that resembles very much the background image of Windows 95 'blue sky with clouds'. Last, and certainly not least, the quality of the video is terrible. This is probably not worth unless you are planning to remaster the dvd with the soundtrack in sync with the video for personal use, and with a decent chapter selection menu. I hope to find out that someone has already put a legal version along with this soundtrack on dvd (I know it exists in vhs).""",0
"b""Nowadays, Uwe Boll has become a kind of joke among fans of the genre. With titles like Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead on his resume, the German director became synonymous with the picariados works. The weakest brands of the horror genre can be. I suppose it's a bit insensitive of us fans to like Boll's pursuit so much, but if the man has not tried vigorously to make excuses and defend his work. In interviews, I'd be much more willing to cut it. It's one thing to make a terrible movie and defend it by way of an illusory assumption that it's a good thing, but another is to try and cover yourself when you know you're succeeding. I wait patiently for Bloodyne Uwe's unenthusiastic defenses. As with all of these video game-based quicks, the plot is irrelevant. This is not to say that a story of descent could not have been produced about Rayne's character, but it certainly fell on his face here. The script is the first culprit. It's something I wrote in the tenth grade English class. All the clich\xc3\xa9s imaginable are on display. It's as if the screenwriter Guinevere Turner had an encyclopedia of banalities. I suppose the excuse might be that she's new to this kind of play, but come on. The world is not descriptive and full of things incongruous with the old world scenario. But in spite of these anachronisms, the dialogue is nothing more than rigid and old-fashioned speech, with a humorous aversion to contractions in sentences. The various plotting machinations that provide the impetus for the characters' actions always remain vague and irrelevant. There is very little here for the actors to work. Not that they are trying hard. No one here seemed to suck, which is understandable. There is humor to be had in delivering clumsy and flushed lines from many of the actors. It almost seemed like some of them (Michael Madsen and Michele Rodriquez, of course) were reading the dialog box from a tips card for the first time. Udo Kier and Billy Zane have useless rolls (although Zane is able to use some of his strange qualities). Ben Kingsley basically sits on the same chair for three quarters of the movie, barely reacting to anything anyone tells him. And Meatloaf, well ... I find myself a bit confused by his short film sequence. All I'm going to say is that it was a hell of a wig. Let's see ... was there anything good? I'll say that Kristanna Loken is definitely hot. It's hard to say if she can act because there is no dialogue worth reciting and no director is able to push her toward a performance, but she definitely looks like I imagine Rayne. The blood, particularly in the unclassified version, is quite vivid, though a little awkward and unconvincing. There's a great troll ... which was never really explained ... and ... ah ... ah, hell, I just wanted someone to give Uwe Boll some advice on career. Maybe he could be a fight scene choreographer, he likes it, or he could try to be a Production Assistant, work back to the top, relearn to make a movie. Heck, he could be a trashcan for everything I care about, someone just tell him to stop making movies. In this way, all mankind could benefit.""",0

"b'The Forbidden Planet is perhaps the pre-eminent work of the 1950s scientific fantasy. It is by no means a hard physical imagination, but it is a thoughtful and intelligent offer in its own way. Famously (but very loosely) based on Shakespeare\'s ""The Tempest,"" this is a film in which there are as many potential layers of meaning as you want to find. With Morbus scaled as Prosper, and Prosper, in turn most likely based on the Elizabethan wizard Dr. John Dee, co-creator of Enochian magical language, is it really a co-incidence that Morbius himself is a linguist? There is much more I would like to say here, but I am holding back by those who are not yet familiar with the film. I do not want to give any spoilers. For those who have seen the film, and who feel inclined to such exercises, I just ask: to whom - or what - do you assign the respective roles of Ariel and Caliban? How would you fit your answers to the broader themes of the film? And what do their answers suggest about how matter and spirit were conceived respectively in the minds of the Elizabethans versus the Americans of the 1950s? Just something to think about. For those who have not yet seen the Forbidden Planet, I would first say that this is a wonderful movie that works perfectly well on the level of a direct adventure that a 10 year old could enjoy. As a work of science fiction, I only emphasize that the depths you will find are more of philosophy than of science; although the classic technological themes of science fiction in the 1950s are presented metaphorically. Fortunately, the reds under the bed / saucer in the sky metaphor that became a clich\xc3\xa9? in much of the day\'s science fiction is nowhere to be found. One thing I want to add before moving on is that this movie is worth being seen just for set design alone. Whether you consider it classic or dated, it is up to you; but by myself I will simply say that I have never seen the visual lexicon of 50s science fiction express itself more fully. Ok, so: so much for the movie. How about the DVD? Well, I\'m happy to say it\'s incredible! Image quality is beautiful, and there are many extras, and very good ones as well. We received loads of promotional material from the time, including in-depth backstage and even an extra bonus movie for kids that also used Robbie the Robot as support. Incidentally, because I\'ve seen some of the comments I\'ve written appear for different editions or releases of what I originally wrote for them, let me emphasize that I\'m writing everything about Forbidden Planet (Special Two-Disc Edition). If you check my profile reviewer, you\'ll see that I\'m not one of those reviewers who distributes five stars as candy. But if you have any interest in classical science fiction, this is a movie you MUST see. And if you\'re looking for the best possible DVD release, the best of my knowledge is this.'",1

Joker is also made to confront some unpleasant realities such as being forced to admit in his heart that Noah is the more rational of the two and especially having to come to terms with the fact that his white skin is not a safety net when he is a fugitive fugitive criminal. There is also a ""human interest"" story in the film\'s subplot, some of them only slightly ahead of its time: the county sheriff becomes the catalyst that keeps the chase from becoming a carefree and disorderly ""good-looking boy"" . One of the city\'s people, portrayed by the legendary Lon Chaney Jr., prevents citizens of a city from becoming a mob of emotionally irrational lynching. Cinematography is great for a movie of its time, although some of the scenarios may have been better constructed and arranged (for example, there is a set where the lights of the city of Los Angeles shine in the background beyond the studio). It\'s also good to hear actors conversing with southern accents that do not sound like ""Foghorn Leghorn"" rejects. Even considering `` redoing \'\' this classic movie would not just be a terrible mistake but would also be a virtual impossibility ... so hopefully no one in Hollyweird, or anywhere else, would ever think of doing it. one thing, and so let this great piece of filmmaking history hold up and continue to stand the test of time. * * *'",1
"b'Unless you can laugh in suspense, be a big fan of Louis Gossett Jr., or fan of Richard Karn (Al of ""Home Improvement""), you probably will not like this movie. It crawls at a slower pace than a hibernating snail. The dialogue is very, very bad. This is one of those movies that you know the only reason the actors, directors, producers and anyone else associated with the movie did this was because of the money. Richard Karn gives a few laughs while a swing, single, archaeologist and LG Jr is a bit scary at times (not because of his character, but because of his exaggeration). However, most of the time everyone in the movie has these & quot; how I ended up here & quot; or & quot; I can not wait until I\'m done with it & quot; Look into their faces. By the way, did I mention that there really is not much plot until the middle of the movie? What makes this movie worse is that it really portrays itself as a serious horror film. Give me some time !

"b'I agree with everyone that the studios are stealing us again. TV movies should be made available to all fans who have already purchased the individual seasons. I believe that fans would even accept the TV movies as a ""disc only"" (no packaging) offer at a reasonable price ... for those who contact the studio. Regarding the ""whole series"" ; I think it\'s a good idea, but it\'s NOT an idea that really works at the moment. My main complaint is the amount of disks and non-standard (LARGE) boxes used for most series. Sure, it looks cool in the store and online, but it sure does not fit nicely on a shelf with the rest of your DVD collection. Try to put some `` full set \'\' box sets on a shelf and see how quickly it starts to look ridiculous! I prefer to buy individual seasons, which fit nicely on a shelf (with the rest of my collection) and usually have better packaging. Remember that some of the ""whole season"" sets have the disks placed one on top of the other (loose) or simply sliding into small cardboard grooves (which scratches the disks). The real answer to integer sets will be the increased capacity of the BLU-RAY format. Fewer discs, nicer box (standard size), etc. Until then, I intend to buy individual seasons.JM'",0

"b'There are certain movies in Hollywood where self-awareness is so obvious, you can practically see what\'s going on in the head of filmmakers. `` We\'re going to talk about terrorism, but we\'re going to put an Arab-looking guy in charge, just so the 9-11 watchdogs do not catch us. We will also mix the good team and the bad team with enough racial colors on each side to look like two Benetton pages so we can congratulate ourselves on how progressive we are. But all these missed opportunities in stereotypes need a place to vent I understood!

The angles change to a dissonant rhythm every 3-4 seconds, although Bruce Willis is among the lucky few who actually look better with age. In fact, I was very entertained, thinking that I was able to suspend my expectation of what might happen next. Well ... until the racist / sexist trash of the hero speaks after coming out of the Yellow Hazard. \'Can I get another dead Asian prostitute b ** tch here immediately? \'\' Unless ""hooker b ** tch"" is colloquial for a female antagonist who is violating security through the use of computer codes. Imagine him killing an African American chief technician and commenting on smoking a drug dealer. No one would bear it. I know I would not. All I\'m saying is that if you\'re going to have all this trouble to create a beautiful rainbow across the cast, why would it rain in the parade by not taking a few more small steps? So after that, I found it took increasing effort to suspend my imagination, implicitly knowing that the film would follow a rigorous script that will creep to meet the expectations of the old people who come to Thailand for you to know ... computer. There would be no more surprises, since all the extravagant cgi thrown against me seemed something I\'ve seen and heard before. The film is about as an older generation with sneakernet technology (McClane for the young computer wiz: ""We\'ll do something (to cross the city) that they invented in the 60\'s: \'jogging\') can still keep the his own against the presumptuous new generation, playing the keyboard.Therefore, it is necessary to entertain by showing the aging generation that their language and physical brand of communication are still valid.I was cheering for the older and more physical generation.But really Hollywood. it has been more than twenty years since the Year of the Dragon.A soft-spoken hero whose most passionate moment in a movie is when he turns into Mickey Rourke\'s Stanley White looks like a dinosaur.And we all know what happened to the dinosaurs.'",0

On the one hand, the film interviews some experts in the field of philosophy and theology, who effectively trace the history and progression of postmodern thought. On the other hand, there are the two filmmakers who simply discuss their lack of help and sometimes irrelevant to the ideas of discussion. The Williamson brothers are asking questions that have little to do with postmodernism and more with their own personal dissatisfaction with the church. It's as if they make this movie to throw away their own ideas and announce it as a film about postmodernism. While some of the interviews with the experts are useful for clarifying the trends of postmodern thinking, this video as a whole is useless as a whole.""",0
"b'The White Hair Bride 2 quickly followed the success of the original film, taking on the tragic story of Cho Yi-Hang (Leslie Cheung) and her forbidden love Lien Ni-Chang (Brigitte Lin). In betraying his sacred oath that he would never doubt his beloved, Cho unleashed a monster. Ni-Chang\'s fury over Cho\'s betrayal drives her completely insane, turning her into a white-haired witch who lives only to destroy all living members of the Eight Clans, especially the Wu Tang clan to which Cho belongs. As for Cho, he retreated to Mount Shin Fung, guarding a mystical flower whose flower (and blooms only once every twenty years) can purify and restore the woman he still loves. Ten years have passed since the deadly night that Ni- Chang went mad and almost alone destroyed the Wu Tang clan. Only two members of the clan survive: Cho, who was guarded on Mount Shin Fung under blizzard conditions all these years, and Cho\'s nephew Kit (Sunny Chan). With Kit\'s impending marriage to Lyre (Joey Maan), the opportunity to promote the lineage exists - and this is how Ni-Chang breaks the party, kidnaps the young bride, and takes her back to her own private castle full of men. - mortal women. There, Lyre is indoctrinated in the philosophy ""See a man, kill a man"" of the witch and programmed to kill Kit with her own hands. The Eight Clans send their best warriors to try to kill the witch and rescue Lyre, but they are almost defenseless against Ni-Chang, who uses his mortal hair as a more effective weapon (sounds strange, I know, but it works very well). It soon becomes clear that the only person who may be able to defeat the white witch is Cho Yi-Hang, and this sets the stage for an unforgettable meeting between the two former lovers. This sequence is a more direct and action-oriented film. than the original The Bride With White Hair, and for that reason I actually found it nicer on the surface. Still, it lacks the depth and beauty of the original, largely because the two lovers do not meet face to face again until the final scene - although this encounter is worth waiting for. Of course, if you have seen and liked the original, you will want to try this sequel.'",1

"b""I was really looking forward to Disney's epic animated dinosaur. After all, supposedly eight years and millions of people were in training. I do not know exactly what I expected. Did I think the recent explosion in computer graphics technology would result in a corresponding breakthrough in the film's narrative? If so, I must have been naive, for what the powers of Disney have decided to do is to use this dazzling technology and graft in it a story that is merely a repetition of those used in some of its past successes. The dinosaur proves that it is not always the best way to go. The opening is spectacular. A flock of dinosaurs are grazing peacefully. We see a mother taking care of an egg nest. Suddenly, a huge carnasour emerges from the forest looking for dinner. In the ensuing chaos, only one egg survives. What follows is a spectacular series of events in which this egg is transported to a distant island is populated by mammals rather than dinosaurs. A family of lemurs finds the egg, and this is where the movie begins to disintegrate. Lemurs begin to speak, and this is the first time words are used in the film. I did not expect Disney to make a film so profoundly different than any of the characters spoke, but I was surprised to find that they had been taken directly from King Leo and Tarzan. It is as if the jungles of Africa were primitive at Disney World, as if things had been millions of years ago are beyond anyone's imagination. I can not emphasize how beautiful this movie is to look at. This shows us that CGI technology continues to advance at a breathtaking speed. The camera flies through wonderful landscapes, dinosaurs are fanstastic to look at, and the colors are wonderful. One particular scene, in which the dinosaur world is almost destroyed by a spectacular meteor shower, is among the best animated sequences ever produced. As for the story, I wonder how many of the Disney bosses actually have kids of their own. . One wonders if they make decisions based on the children they see around them or focus groups. Has it ever occurred to you that everything that fascinates children is not necessarily cute and cuddly or even safe. When I was a child, for example, I fell in love with the ocean, not because I thought it was warm and safe, but for deeper reasons I could not express it. I'm not sure what the children of today think of as dinosaurs, but I doubt they see them as great puppies or as creatures of Judeo-Christian ethics. In this movie, the dinosaur that the lemurs save grows to be someone who teaches their companions that the survival of the fittest is wrong and that helping their dinosaur mate is everything. Somehow, I do not believe the average child will buy their argument, not when it comes to nature creatures. I think they'll find your preaching a bit boring. Assuming that children take everything and translate it into a fantasy world, Disney has underestimated the intelligence of its young audience and has shown that it may have become somewhat out of touch with its target market, at least when it comes to that. subject.""",0

"b""First of all, you can not watch this DVD if you're some kind of politically awkward stranger. All the stereotypes, the metal chiefs, the religious father, and the professor of gender studies, are reinforced and ruthlessly beaten with brutal sarcasm. So if you could be offended by it, DO NOT ASSIST! ! ! There, now, if you can take things with a grain of salt, and you enjoy extremely cruel comedy, then Dirtbags is the movie for you! You get a bunch of college burn-outs, each of them trying to achieve a specific goal in life (usually involving getting women's sexual favors), and engaging in crazy situations where there is usually no escape, just one more dive . in absolute degeneration. I'm sure there's some sort of thesis in this for all of you college students out there ... you may never be able to achieve your goals by dishonest means? Oh, I do not think so. It probably does not make sense, but it does not matter! And you have to love the characters, who are so colorful and strange that no fiction could ever create them completely. These are real images of life ... I've seen male gender studies teachers and Ogre-gym types, so this is stranger than fiction. Like I said, this movie is politically incorrect. No, I'll take it back; is the anti-political correctness. It's great to see that someone went to extremes and completely ridiculed the politically correct, exposing him for the absurdity to which he was brought. If there are no other redeeming qualities of this film in the eyes of the wider public, at least it's the social critique that makes South Park look as tame as Sesame Street. The computer generated randomly and coarsely (the skeleton during the pizza). the man's play across the campus, the bee flying into the soda can, the drowning baby several times in the river) add a nice touch of quirkiness to B movies, and prove the ingenuity of home movies. I personally find these things great. The scenes of random nudity are, in my humble opinion, more out of pure randomness than gratifying drooling on the part of the viewer. Why is there a scene of a naked woman for several minutes? Because it is random and so completely stupid that it becomes quite funny. I need, however, to subtract a star for two reasons: one, the fact that this DVD does not have chapters selections (you can only watch the movie all the time)) and two, the sound. With the sound, there is always music playing, and sometimes it overcomes the dialogue (extremely annoying!), And because of the low budget, some of the dialogues are not cleverly recorded, so it's low on the mix. Once I watched this, I did not really get it, but when I watched it a second time, I was hitting it hysterically. Play a special Peter Steele appearance of Type O Negative, a fantastic soundtrack including Immolation, Candlemass, and a bunch of various funny songs, and you will have a real surprise! ... That is, if you are not afraid of not taking this seriously.""",1

Another perfect selection made by Walt Disney! The special effects were PERFECT! I learned that Cherry Tree Lane was actually on the inner stage, but I thought at the beginning it happened in London! It is undoubtedly the best set I have ever seen. Plus, I was really surprised when they wanted it to look like a Broadway stage! I actually thought they got to do this when they were doing the song ""Step in Time,"" which had a really perfect energy, and there were no accidents, which really surprised me!

"b'I was very disappointed with the Sneiders Perfect Rebounding Workout. I bought it because I wanted an alternative to the Urban Rebounding Compilation DVDs.The first sign of trouble was in the interview beginning on tape, which showed the host, presumably Dr. Sneider, with a gigantic belly. This is not the model I was looking for. To be honest, if you do the training in this video, you will have a good general workout. But the video is so repetitive, completely devoid of enthusiasm, downright boring and unprofessional. For the part in rebound, it makes the same movements, not very imaginative, repeatedly. By switching from one movement to another, the camera is almost never focused on the teacher\'s feet to see what he is doing, so you can only guess. The ""class"" consists of a group of people totally out of shape and challenged with pace on the front lawn of the Royal Hawaiian hotel. They do not exercise in unison, and the camera is usually in them, not in the teacher. You must have hand weights to make the program. For the abs part of the show, for most of it the cameraman forgot to focus the camera. The two people are just blots. Also, there is absolutely no point in doing your abs or yoga or pilates moves in a rebounder. It is quite uncomfortable doing it, and you can do a much better workout by doing them on a treadmill without getting hurt on the hard rebound frame. While the exercises in the abdominal and yoga parts were good, I highly recommend you get a different DVD, such as Candlelight Yoga (excellent) with Sara Ivanhoe. That has many of the same movements as the yoga part of this workout, but safe, well taught, professionally photographed, and most of all, ENTHUSIASM.This was just a very, very annoying, repetitive exercise video.

"b'An amazing movie made under almost impossible circumstances. Set in Paris in the 1840s along a lower-class theater district (the ""Boulevard of Crime""), the main story is about a mime (played by Jean-Louis Barrault) who falls in love with ""a woman of experience "". \'\' - played brilliantly by Arletty. In an incredibly pungent and delicate scene, Arletty almost begs Barrault to make love to her, but he does not seize the moment and he leaves her. She finds lust in the arms of others. Other leading characters include a degenerate philosopher / writer; a Shakespearean actor; a rich score that ""holds"" Arletty; and the woman who loves Barrault and ends up marrying him. But the love between Barrault and Arletty remains true over the years, although in the end, after spending a glorious night together, she leaves him forever. The acting is superb everywhere, although what makes the film a masterpiece is the writing of Jacques Prevert: the dialogue is simply brilliant. The film was filmed during the Nazi occupation and many of the actors left the set to go out and fight in the resistance. Sets were constantly moved to avoid bombardments and Nazi interference when possible. The film is about 190 minutes long; the Nazis had a law that no film could exceed 90 minutes, so this was done as TWO independent films. The film is not only a testament to love in all its passionate intensity (after all, it\'s a French film), it\'s also about the survival of a country and a big city, Paris - a whole civilization, actually - suffering under the bootheel of a fierce oppressor: it is on the light of love and culture and memory always shining from the darkness of hell.

"b'I have been practicing yoga regularly for about a year. I am familiar with the flow of Vinyasa and with Hatha Yoga and enjoy both. Sadly, Sybel\'s Yoga was a disappointment. I kept thinking she did not know what kind of yoga she was doing: it was focused pose as Hatha, but the pace was extremely fast (faster than most of Vinyasa I did) and there really was no flow to the movements. She jumped directly into poses without any focus of breathing before, and instead of making some movement to warm the body, she began with stretching poses. This confusing pattern continued throughout the dvd, while she alternated between strength, stretching, and relaxation, seemingly at random. Each pose was held for just 2-3 seconds before moving on, and the ""inhale, exhale"" reminders were too quick for a good soothing yoga breath. Although Sybel mentions in the opening that his yoga is for people at any level of fitness, many of the poses included in this dvd are very advanced for beginners and would need a lot of modification for someone who is not at the peak of fitness.'",0

It also seems that they used an old VHS to rip rather than using original sources or even a LaserDisc, those huge record-sized DVD discs, they had a much higher quality than VHS and did not degrade over time like VHS . If they pulled from one of them, it would be much better. They also did not need much time to create menus, when you watch trailers and language exchange, it's a simple and muted menu. I could have done a better job with free software on the menus. In addition, the discs were made in Mexico, they could not even spend enough to have the made in the USA.

b'Choose another version at all costs! My wife wanted this movie since she loved both the first one. She had read somewhere that this version was very good and could not be more wrong. The transfer is terribly faded. Needless to say I will never buy a SYNERGY version again. I wish I could give it 0 Stars. Too bad a good movie was ruined by such a bad DVD. UGH!',0
"b'I bought this video with the understanding that it will provide me with the basics of yoga and that progressively I will become better at Yoga and more comfortable practicing it. The video provides a number of explanations about basic yoga postures with a small chart. It is very difficult to read on the screen, the colot is very light and helps very little. The video is very good for those who have been practicing yoga for some time and have a good understanding of it. I tried all the programs contained in the video, with no success in being able to follow the movements and very little knowledge of how to do it. I had to buy a basic yoga book to understand the yoga positions in detail. The DVD is now on the shelf. I do not recommend the beginner DVD. This is a more advanced video.'",0
"b'For the plot outline, see the back of the DVD box: ""Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) is a private investigator specializing in unexplained supernatural phenomena. Their cases plunge into the dark corners of the world, seeking the truth in the hidden remnants of ancient civilizations. Now the greatest mystery of his past is about to become the most dangerous case he has ever faced. With the help of his ex-girlfriend, archaeologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid), and his bitter rival, government agent Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff), Edward is about to learn this just because you do not believe in something that does not . t means it can not kill you! ""According to the character of Carnby, the fear of the dark is what keeps us alive. Unfortunately, however, the fear of bad movies does not stop us from renting them. Despite the awful reviews, I decided to give in to the temptation to rent Alone In The Dark (I had a free lease, so I figured there could not be much loss). It was even worse than I expected ... On the one hand, creatures that are released from the depths of darkness - or whatever the clich\xc3\xa9 of horse feces is scattered throughout history - are pathetic CGI dinosaurs. Anything interesting, scary or just ""cool"" about them? Do not . Only nonsense computer-generated monsters that can not entertain the public in the simplest way. For two, the acting is horrendous. Seeing Tara Reid on the DVD\'s top credits made me roll my eyes, but seeing her trying to act as an archaeologist in a science fiction movie made me laugh. The only decent performance midway is given by Christian Slater, but still not enough to cover up the rest. And for three, the film is terribly boring, with few action scenes. Oh, of course, some unknown bumps here and there, some creatures flashing on the screen, and a little blood is included. But the real action? Very little . The small amounts of action he did include the reason why I gave this stinker two stars. I hate watching a movie suffer, but this one deserves it. In conclusion, do not make the same mistakes that most of these reviewers did by renting the movie, knowing how awful it should be. Just rely on the ratings of this one. You will save your money and your time.'",0
"b'In 1879, a British column was almost annihilated by a large ""impi"" of Zulus warriors near Isandhlwana. Then a small British force camped nearby Rorke\'s Drift (a trading and mission station), made up of 104 shaped soldiers and a number of invalids in a makeshift hospital became the next target. For two days the station was attacked by waves of Zulus warriors. The total number of intruders was about 4500. In the end, almost 400 Zulus were killed compared to only about 20 of the defenders, the hospital was burned to the ground, and 11 Victoria Crosses were awarded to the survivors. The film itself is a reasonably faithful re-creation of events. in Rorke\'s Drift, with good acting by Michael Caine, Stanley Baker and a great support cast of Zulus. The ferocity of the attack, the stubborn and desperate defense of the small garrison, and the chaos of melee combat on the barricades can be felt by cinematography. One wonderful aspect of this film is that the battle scenes were filmed using a large number of actors in the role of Zulu warriors, who were obviously able to re-create the tactics and movements of the royal army of 1879. Their war cries synchronized the spear movements against the shield and the advance of the formation created the sensation of a real army moving to attack the apparently doomed garrison. This is one of the few films that gives the viewer a notion of what combat must have been like in the days before the emergence of mechanized armies.'",1

"b""That's what you expect from the Monty Python guys. It's silly, irreverent and totally weird. Erik the Viking is a comedy of dark humor, and even if that sounds weird, those of you who have seen Monty Python and the Holy Grail or Brian's Life will understand. This will never be called the masterpiece of cinematography, acting or special effects. Then again, it is not for. The film does what it sets out to do. The charm of the film is all about performing some rather silly situations. From Vikings flying across the ends of the Earth to Erik fighting against enemies who think he is invisible. The special effect hardly rivals that of other Python films made in the 1970s, and this was done in 1989. Monty Python's cast performances are not the best, but they are fun and satisfying. The thing is, none of this is really important. Erik the Viking is a good, fun story with some subtle reflections on the human condition and religion. Even the dark stuff turns out not to be so bad in the end. This DVD is really hard to find and to make matters worse, Sony has set up the Director's Cut, but so far never bothered to release it in the United States. If you have a free DVD from the region, there is a 'Son's Cut' from the director available in the UK so there is hope. If you happen to find the rare US-less release for any reasonable price, I'd recommend getting it without question, as Sony has not made any announcements for reissues. If you're a Monty Python fan, see Erik the Viking. Those of you who do not understand the whole mood of Python do not appreciate that either. If you like humor mixed with some decent Norse mythical stories (and it's not critical of low production budgets), then this movie should be a nice drift from reality.""",1
"b'We all know Clint Eastwood through his work. The countless Western TV shows and movies that he starred presented to us. His role has changed from Star to Superstar in his epic portrayals of ""Dirty Harry,"" the tough homicide inspector. Since those days, we have seen his excellence as a director in many more excellent dramas and westerns. Although controversial, we investigate their morality and sense of care above and beyond the cultural meanings of morality in Million Dollar Baby. old age when you\'d think Dirty Harry would just be resting in retirement, sipping his beer and smoking his cigarettes on a front porch, Clint Eastwood directs and stars in a movie in which he\'s retired drinking beer and smoking cigarettes on the front porch, growling at everyone, their neighbors, their war experiences, and their own family! In Gran Torino, it shows that it is possible to teach an old dog new tricks. Always immersed in hate, intolerance and racial stereotypes, it is slowly transformed by its neighboring Hmong immigrants. While he takes the young teenager Hmong under his wing (although in the beginning he was made to protect the one thing he really loves, his 1972 mint condition, Gran Torino), he takes the young Thao away from the gang bangers without goal. ""Mans"" Thao up. (As he has learned, he has inherited flawed standards.) As he does this, he discovers that on the human emotional side he really has much more in common with the Immigrant Ethic than with his own relatives! As \'\' Walt \'\' softens and learns to appreciate the Immigrant\'s generosity and hospitality, we see the true heart of our \'\' Dirty Harry \'\'. ""He has more purpose in life now than simply hating everyone and loving his Gran Torino. When young Thao is ""man enough"" to go on a date, Walt even lets the young man (who has tried to steal his True Love) use his Gran Torino to take her to a date in style! And when the neighborhood gang threatens and attempts to kill the immigrant family, Walt releases Dirty Harry into himself, and sacrifices himself to protect the people who have adopted the ""old, crunchy bastard"" as one of them! Walt\'s last request was to give Thao his Gran Torino. In the last scene, when we see Thao driving Walt\'s old Gran Torino, the car with the ugly grille as Walt used to do, the joy in Thao\'s face reveals that Thao is not just driving Walt\'s soul. but Walt\'s soul was transplanted into the young Thao! If something that Clint Eastwood did in this worthwhile film is this: show how, in a changing America, by embracing and celebrating diversity in this country, we all strengthen what this country is in the first place!

"b""this DVD is a treasure, particularly if you like me, you've seen the band live and can not get enough of them.

"b""When a nuclear submarine descends unexpectedly in the Pacific Ocean and a hurricane prevents the military from sending a crew into it, they subcontract an oil drilling team under the area headed by Bud Brigman (Ed Harris). To help the probe team, the military sends a group of Navy SEALs, led by Lieutenant Coffey (Michael Biehn), accompanied by the undersea designer and Bud, again wife Lindsey Brigman (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio). But as they scour the nuclear submarine, they realize there may be more to sink the submarine than they thought, and while Lieutenant Coffey believes the Russians are responsible, the crews believe there may be something more ... supernatural. There are a few directors who really know how to overcome with each of the efforts the way James Cameron does. His first film, Terminator, set a precedent for action movies in the 1980s, and he only surpassed that achievement with the Terminator 2. With Aliens he made a film that was at least equal to that of Ridley Scott's Alien , making a sequence that changed the mood and style, respecting the original. In 1989, James Cameron directed The Abyss, a film that occurred mostly underwater, and was filmed in the largest underwater set of the time. The set, built on a semi-finished nuclear reactor facility, included 7 million gallons of water. So, among Cameron's other achievements, how does The Abyss stand? The Abyss is definitely Cameron's most underrated film. Looking at movies like Avatar, Aliens, Terminator 2 and Terminator 2, it's easy to see how a movie like The Abyss can be overlooked, but on closer inspection, the Abyss fits right next to the others. Like the other Cameron films, he shows great attention to detail with incredible special effects. On a technical scale, the film looks like real life, something that is always great when it comes to a Cameron movie. But like the other Cameron films, it's not about the special effects, but about the human element. Cameron does a great job of humanizing his characters and embodying their relationships. The acting was phenomenal, of course I would expect nothing less from a movie that includes Michael Biehn (The Terminator, Aliens) and Ed Harris (The Truman Show, The Rock). Biehn does very well as a military man who has lost communication with the outside world and has to call himself alone for his next step, and that drives him crazy. Ed Harris is great as the team leader who begs for his ex-wife who continues to run away in different jobs without him, and Marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio is great as the aforementioned wife who thinks getting stuck with Bud and his team is repulsive but grows near the husband she left behind and the staff he administers. If you have not seen this movie but like the other Cameron movies, I recommend you give it a try. I would say that this movie is possibly better than Terminator, and since I think Aliens is better than Terminator, I think this is the same as Aliens. Take a shot, this is definitely a classic that deserves more exposure than the one obtained.""",1
"b'(5/3/12, 1 star for this Blu-ray release, 5 stars for the movie) I have the regular DVD with English subtitles, which StudioCanal inexplicably omitted from its Blu-ray version. Why would they do that? To make a few dollars more profit? Apart from insensitivity, it is certainly a wrong financial calculation on their part. There are countless less-than-perfect moviegoers who are likely to go through this release. My wife is a non-native English speaker who needs English subtitles to understand all the dialogues, especially when the actors have a British accent. She would not be watching the Blu-ray version, and since we always watch movies together, I do not either. I suppose there are millions of viewers all over the world who feel the same way.'",0
"b'Madacy did it again ... took what could be a decent DVD and turned them into trash. The video transfer of the movie is very bad, but the worst is the audio.

This is a shame because younger people who have never seen these classics can come out with the wrong impression.'",0
"b'This is a remarkably bad presentation of the ""great battles"" of World War II. To begin with, in an alleged introduction to the causes of World War II - probably written in 1946, when the Soviets had to be satisfied - the authors do not mention the SOVIEMM GERMAN PACT OF 1939! ! ! !

"b""It was the franchise's slugfest that fans thought would never happen except in the form of comic books. After years and years of failed attempts and false beginnings, the powers that finally came together. Hoping to capitalize on the surprise success of the merger of two successful horror franchises with Freddy vs. Jaso, two of the most popular science fiction creatures go all the way in Alien Vs. Predator with those pesky humans caught in the middle. It's not a clich\xc3\xa9; that this movie does not like. Disposable characters are broadly outlined. For example, a bottle cap worn around a character's neck is considered a defining feature. The film even manages to include the old chestnut where the characters surpass the fireball blast. Fans who expect the two alien races to start waiting for over an hour until the first battle, but it is quite impressive when they play around. like something out of a comic book. Of course, the fight scenes are pretty cool in all their CGI-assisted glory, but that's hardly an endorsement. Poor Lance Henriksen is playing here as a selfish businessman who provides the only human connection with the other Alien movies (it is hinted that he is the inspiration for the android bishop in Aliens). It is in only a quarter of the movie before being shipped quickly. There is an audio commentary by screenwriter / director Paul W.S. Anderson and the actors Lance Henriksen and Sanaa Lathan. They connect at the same time seemingly oblivious to the narrative mess that is this movie. Also includes an audio commentary by visual effects supervisor John Bruno and creator effects creators Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr. Anyone who likes to hear these details will find this track informative. There are three deleted scenes totaling two minutes and include a bit of Predator humor that was properly cut. Also included are two trailers and a gallery of comic book covers. for Alien from Dark Horse Vs. Series Predator.Alien vs. Predator was not worth waiting for and comic book fans will feel cheated. The movie begins slowly but once the Aliens and Predators start hitting each other, the weak script and awkward plot mercifully become the background. It's a shame because both alien races are poised for countless story ideas that subsequent sequences have not been able to capitalize on effectively. All we have left is a beautiful, numbered movie.""",0

"b""I was terribly excited to find that one of my favorite classic films, the 1963 Peter Brooks & quot; Lord of the flies was on the dvd. I was even more excited when I saw that I had been offered a luxury treatment by a studio called Criterion. & quot; Lord of the Flies was the first DVD I bought and introduced me to the phenomenal Criterion Collection. Every extra on this DVD is fantastic and interesting, there is no filling or tasteless compliments. Just the comment is worth the price of this DVD, gives a magnificent view on how this film was made: for example, the film was one of the first independent productions ever produced. This is one of those rare remarks that enhances your appreciation and understanding of the film, I rate it alongside & quot; Seven Samurai & quot; and & quot; Great illusion & quot; (also both Criterion dvds reviews) as among the best I've heard. The movie itself seems abitlessly fantastic, worlds better than any vhs or laserdisc editing I've seen previously; The criterion has produced an incredible and clean image that will be outstanding in any video setting. _Lord of the Flies_ is one of my favorite romances; Golding masterfully touched on many themes and concepts about society and managed to capture the essence of mankind in the boy caricatures he created. In most cases, these themes and ideas appear very faithfully in the film. As pointed out in the dvd comment; there is no credit for script, because there was no script, the production team worked directly from the novel, using it as the only source of the story. The result is a remarkably clear and coherent adaptation of the original novel, brought to life with great faith and astonishing dexterity for a filmmaker for the first time. Some technical limitations can still be seen in the final product, but they do little to lessen the pleasure of the film. In short: a fantastic, dark and compelling story is brilliantly brought to life in such a harsh way that it seems to the viewer at times as a documentary unfolding. Finally, the film received a real DVD treatment that perfectly complements and improves the film itself; in everything, the price of admission is worth a lot.""",1

"b""Okay, I read the book back in high school and I fell in love with it! I must have read it several times. I recommend it to all my friends. When years later I heard they were making a movie, I was so excited! I was literally jumping up and down. I could not wait to see a new werewolf movie and my least favorite book. I thought this would be great, it would be # 1 at the box office! So I dragged my friends to see them at the opening meeting. What I noticed was that for an opening date, the theater was not very crowded. I thought `` oh, well, maybe people did not understand the title. '' Less than half the way played the movie my mouth just opened in disbelief! It was an abomination! They massacre him with his misinterpretation of the book and use horrible effects! They did not go from humans directly to the wolves in the flash of a bright light! And I almost cried when I saw the end! It was the complete opposite of the book! What the hell he used a silver knife to stab her! ! ! ! This whole movie lost the torment, the feelings and the pain that Vivian was going through at the end of the book. I suggest people who watched this movie read the book! I wanted to get out of the theater so many times if it was not for my friends. I cursed all the time I watched this horrible movie! He made my favorite book so cheesy and fake that it was awful! If there was a rating lower than a star, I would have put it! I really hope that someone comes a lot and make this book get into the movie it could have been! Hell, it could have been as good as Twilight, or rather, if they had followed the BOOK!""",0
"b'Ghost World is a maturing story that defines the character of a generation that is one of the most illusive of modern memory. Enid (Thora Birch) is trapped in a small town with her peers and adults going nowhere. Only Norman, the passenger on a bus, is trustworthy in his opinion - perhaps because he is at least trying to get out of town - though this is not something that is thrown into the audience, but something to think about. a thoughtful film with engaging characters, sharp wit and gentle warmth. The composition, including the use of color in the ensemble and in the clothing, is exuberant and clear; highly expressive editing and camera. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes to better understand the lives and problems of middle-class youth struggling with identity-seeking in the late twentieth century.'",1

"b'As a former Navy and Vietnam veteran, I have to disagree with Mr. Brennan\'s portrayal of the second half of this film. The war scenes were marginal at best and they could not grasp the ""realism"" of the war ... The platoon was much better at it. Especially since Oliver Stone was a veteran himself. However, the scenes from the training camp at the FMJ were accurate. R. Lee Ermey played the Drill Instructor perfectly, as it should have, having been the same in real life. I had several D.I. It\'s like that in the camp and I can assure you, it was like this during the Vietnam war. I can laugh at the movie now, but while at boot camp it was no laughing matter, we were there to learn how to fight and go to war, other skills were learned, but they were secondary. We had to be tough and they were sure we were. The part of the camp was almost like a documentary to me! Having said all this, the movie was like two parts to me. The first half and the second half. With one being killed and the other just so and completely based on a Hollywood perception of what the war was like. For those who were not there, trust me ... It was very different from this version. Overall, because of the performance of R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D\'Onofrio I gave 4 stars.'",1
