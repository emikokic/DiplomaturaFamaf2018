"b'If ever a film needs subtitles in English, this is one. Accents and soft speaking are fantastic but difficult to follow because you can not understand what they are saying and without subtitles. His songs were simply beautiful and the story is great, but many things are lost in not understanding what they are saying. But it was a refreshing film from most out there now. Beautiful acting and history.'",1
"b""`` Just Married '' is a painfully mischievous film that is almost too lighthearted and cute. Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy play a couple Romeo and Juliet-esqe that has been repeated in so many films, it's sickening - he's the classic crazy sportsman and son of middle-income parents, and is the daughter of some billionaire whose profession is not we never learn. His parents would have preferred to marry her with the snobby Peter Prentice, a dull antagonist who is more of an obstacle than a real character. However, the beautiful couple gets married and makes a trip to Europe, where their lies meet and the incredible circumstances (they are driven out of a hotel after having ruined the circuit system trying to connect a kind of sex toy) hinder their perfect honeymoon fun. The film was aggravated by bad jokes, boring characters and clich\xc3\xa9 was plot I think I thought to laugh once. The terrible thing about this film was how amazing it was all. Each character was able to extract a beautiful and moving monologue from scratch. Most of the speeches did not even fit the personality of the character, for example, Kutcher's character gave at least two of these monologues, and each was one of the best parts of the film's script. Too bad they came out playing hard and awkward, since the character should not be the brightest light in the box. In the end, the characters were painfully underdeveloped. We do not know if Murphy's character likes to be rich, nor can we ever really discern whether he is a rich girl or an intellectual who loves art. We never find out what Murphy's father does, and although a good, strong father-son relationship is mentioned between the character of Kutcher and his father, we never know for sure. In the end, an attractive blonde was constantly around Murphy's character ... was she a sister? friend ? cousin? He tormented me throughout the film. So, why not 1 star instead of 2? Well, Murphy and Kutcher proved to be excellent actors with fantastic chemistry together. Murphy in particular illuminated the screen with his dazzling personality and his cute and scratchy voice. Kutcher will always be typed like a dumb, but he's a good character. I found them the only highlights of the film. Bottom line: this film kept me awake. It was quick and slightly pleasant, but nothing new or different was missing. See if you like teenage chicks, not if your idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8ba movie is what makes you think.""",0
"b'I may not be able to add much to the reviews, whose praises agree with all the content of this great movie, but I still felt obliged to offer my two cents on the BluRay, which is just as fantastic. With the full measure of the glory of the pure Granduer of the background for this story now properly restored in HiDef, the intrinsic drama of the plot now finally finally has an equally worthy canvas on which to be presented - one fact perpetually lost on each another video presentation I\'ve seen before. It is actually a deep appreciation of the expected impact of this film and, from any and all previous video editions of it, in fact a transformation from a first-quality adventure of otherwise acceptable scale to an adventure of first class and overall a remarkable show! I would dare to say that it did not seem so nice when I remember seeing it in my local theater many years ago. Besides, it seems so beautiful, I do not think anyone can dream, from its appearance here, that this film is actually approaching its 50th anniversary. From the opening credits, I see that the film was originally shot in 70 mm, so with much more detail than the most common 35 mm film. You can expect similar performances in HiDef with other films of the 65 or 70mm variety, like 2001: A Space Odessy or Lawrence of Arabia - IF the record transfer is good - and it certainly is. The image inside the frame of this record is always, and absolutely, stable like the Rock of Gibralter. There was only the minimum amount of flicker, as seen on my setup, but again, only rarely and hardly noticeable when it was viewed - I\'m still not sure if the disk was actually to blame or not. Not a pinch of moir\xc3\xa9, anywhere. The sound is quite good and far better than I had any reason to hope for. Although the soundtrack of John Barry was apparently originally in mono, it is by far the best I\'ve ever heard before - it also has a better impression of the original soundtrack (mono) available on CD, if memory serves. Still, the sound effects track on this record is either true stereo, or, more likely, it was derived from various elements of isolated sound effects and then ""reworked"" during post production. There are also some nice extras: more than two documentaries on the making of the film, the film\'s commentary, the theatrical trailer and also a short but interesting interview with John Barry about the origins of his ideas for the soundtrack. But all in all, I like it so much when such a majestic and monumental film like this gets the royal treatment it does here. Sometimes, presentation is everything! Highly, highly recommended! !'",1
"b'I\'ve been a 3D dice for many decades. I pre-ordered this from Amazon and the man, what a disappointment! The video quality is only slightly better than the bootleg 3D DVD with rear shutter in the 90s (and at least the 3D DVD was FULL SCREEN) that was made from a Japanese 3D VHD disc. Even the ""red / blue"" 3D trailer for this film (from the 3D Film Expo to the Egyptian Theater here in Hollywood) has been in full screen. If you are on Google this title, you will find some websites with comparison photos (PAL, NTSC, DVD, Blu-ray, etc ...) and you can clearly see that this Blu-ray 3D clips the film from ALL FOUR LATI. Only a little bit is cut from left / right, but it lacks a bit from above and below to create this 1.85 full screen report. Because of this, some of the three-dimensional perceptions are lost, and it\'s probably what others here have meant for some scenes that look ""flat"" or ""2D"". One of the most striking scenes is that in which Margot and Mark are talking in the livigea. This wonderful shot is obviously set for the 3D effect. Margot\'s hand is resting on the table in the foreground, showing that beautiful diamond ring. Guess what ? In this Blu-ray 3D version, its ENTIRE hand is completely cut! I continued to notice these scenes cut out during the film ... characters cut into pieces, tops of cut lampshades, etc. Yes, it\'s nice to see that red dress that looks REALLY red, but unfortunately the colors are severely saturated. I think I\'ll keep on ""House of Wax"" or ""Creatures FTBL"" until the reviews come from other guinea pigs LOL! I\'m sure others will agree that the black ink printed on the Blu-ray disc is horrible. I\'ve seen better labels on bootleg DVDs! Anyway, only my 2 cents.'",0

"b'If you look at the fine print on this DVD, you will see that it is not approved by the Wayne Foundation. And the boy proves it. The image quality of this DVD has all the characteristics of being a DVD recording of a VHS copy of the film.

I have a VHS tape that has a better image of this DVD. Everyone is writing the Wayne Foundation and telling about the unfortunate version of this film! If we make ourselves heard, we might be able to convince them to publish widescreen, quality Criterion versions of John Wayne\'s less famous films. UPDATE: PLEASE!

"b'This film is based on a true story, and I saw the original story on ""A Haunting."" I was hoping the movie version would give me a more creepy version of the original story, but all I got was bad acting, a lackluster plot and terrible effects.

"b'... but a terrible DVD. The sound is simply old Dolby Surround and the movie is full screen. I find it very annoying.

This version must remain intact in the future widescreen version.'",0
"b'From time to time I revisited this film. Entertaining it is. `` El Dorado \'\' has his hockey moments, James Caan goes on and on to ""ride bravely"" in a poem on El Dorado, Maudie (John Wayne\'s love interest), where many of Wayne\'s women are filmed they are interrupted: ""I\'m not going to cry, I\'ll buy a pine box, about 6 feet for you"" and then the necessary talk about how men are stupid for the fighting and the women are hurriedly waiting for their men to come home , blah, blah blah He has a fellow geezer (Arthur Honeycutt) who imitates Walter Brennen from ""Rio Bravo"", James Caan who imitates Ricky Nelson from ""Rio Bravo"" and Mitchum who imitates Dean Martin from ""Rio Bravo"" and, finally, Charlene Holt, who imitates Angie Dickinson in ""Rio Bravo"". \'\' See the scheme? ""Rio Bravo"" and ""El Dorado"" are essentially the same film. A sheriff, his aide and John Wayne, his aide and his girlfriend. Formula. Nonetheless, here\'s a good movie. There are elements of Wild Woolly Western here. Christopher George plays the bad gunman who still warms up with Cole Thornton and John Wayne\'s SPOILER ALERT! But there is a scene that is golden: George and his gang of bad men walk into the bar to see the other bad boy / breeder Edward Asner. As they enter, tinkling piano music plays and moves. He came out of a 1920s-era shoot. It is not a work of art. But it will entertain. It will grow up on you with the subsequent presentations. John Wayne is the last John Wayne with his John Waynisms. Mitchum is practically a spectator and goes through the movements. All in all, fun and a poem for Cowboy formula movies.'",1
"b""If you want to be alone while watching Alone In The Dark, there is good news and bad news. The good news is that you will get your wish. The bad news is that misery loves company. Letting dangling from the nipples of red nipples over a pit of cacti and scorpions would be less painful than sitting in this menage a trash on aliens, monsters, nefarious scientists, kidnapped children, a paranormal putan, and Tara Reid as museum curator. Pinch me, I have to dream. Better a pinch than a slap in the face, which is what this boring slot in a movie offers. Alone in the Dark is apparently based on an old Atari game, one I've never heard of. What I remember of the old Atari games were their rudimentary graphics and plot. I doubt that the extended retrospective of the film was also a consideration. So, to fill in the blanks, the writers Elan Mastai, Michael Roesch and Peter Scheerer borrow and steal from other films. Best Film Movies that make you realize that you're not just looking at an imitation, but a bad imitation, like Chuck Norris doing the tribute to Judy Garland. I admit that his interpretation of Easter Parade made me cry, but only because he was kicking me in the face. Here's what it felt like to watch Alone in the Dark. I do not care about stupid, stupid horror films, but I hate the stupid and stupid horror films that refuse to recognize this fact. Alone in the Dark comes with such a poker face it's impossible to know if we should take something like that seriously. We are, but we do not do it = or, more precisely, we can = t. There is no room for maneuver in the script, directing or acting. Government conspiracies abound (after a long opening of servitude) in Alone in the Dark, which finds paranormal investigator Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) in collaboration with an elite group of government agents defeating an ancient evil. As an orphan, Edward escaped the clutches of an unscrupulous government agent / scientist, Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker), whose depraved experiments turned children into crossed zombies. Now that Hudgens has found the final key to unlock the portal between darkness and light, it's up to Edward, former lover and curator Aline Cedrac (Reid) and commando chief Burke (Stephen Dorff) to save humanity. Yes, that = s who I would call when the extreme evil decides to slap humanity: two actors who ride the direct guide to the video and an actress famous for the flashes of the paparazzi. Was it a casting or a rebate decision? The director Uwe Boll (The House of the Dead) is not much help, never allowing the actors to get out of the thin box or express emotions beyond the written word. If everyone in front of or behind the camera had just recognized the obvious, Alone in the Dark would have been a blast. Computer generated monsters that never seem to occupy the same plot of actors, trigger-happy commando, a twisted plot that makes no sense, characters of paper dolls, all the trappings of a stupid time. Too bad the people behind Alone in the Dark did not fall into that trap.""",0
"b""We kept yawning while we watched this smelly Sony. It's probably the worst digital animation film we've ever seen, and we've all seen the biggies. BUT, we gave it 2 stars and not one because it has some fun scenes. But those funny scenes are too few. It is really devoid of adult humor. Children can have fun (we do not have any so we can not comment). Please do not waste your money on this movie unless you are sure your little ones will like it.""",0
"b'Still disappointing. I really hoped, but between the dubious lines and the poor acting it was rather hard to bear. I think the wolves chasing the vampire were the highlight of the film. I was completely lacking any emotional connection, I think it was actually worse than Twilight if that were possible. It amazes me completely that with such a large budget and a fan base, they still can not get close to doing it well. Poor clothes, makeup, even the soundtrack were bad. Go read the books, there is no comparison.'",0

This film is reductive, I'm a SFX designer and I felt offended by the mokery made for science fiction films along this one. My advice avoids this ... no ... scartch that ... rent it and watch HOW messed up can a film actually be.Buah haa haa haaa haa!""",0
"b""I do not know who I'm more sorry for, Stephen Dorff or Christian Slater. Dorff, who is a great actor even if you never know him in the movies he's in, has never been in any good since the original Blade was created in 1998. Slater's career has worsened over the years , practically taking part in some flop projects. Both actors sleepwalk through their roles in this latest videogame for the film adaptation of director Uwe Boll, the same guy who brought us another adaptation to the video game, the incredibly ugly House of the Dead. Alone in the Dark is not much better, with such a nonexistent story that you're scratching your head wondering what's going on before you pray for everyone to be killed. Even Tara Reid is on board as the smart girl and, as the previous reviewers have said, we know she is smart because she wears glasses. There's no saving factor on Alone in the Dark, and if you submit to the House of the Dead parody, then you know what to expect here.""",0
"b""This DVD attempts to encompass the entire history of North American exploration in about an hour. Given his goal, I consider doing a good job of doing it. He summarized five hundred years of history and many dozens of expeditions and explorers in short puffs of information. I do not think this is a good educational tool, since it would probably be uninteresting - it does not have very interesting stories, just a flow of information. Rather, this is a good starting point for someone who wants to do research on North American exploration and would like an introduction to major events and to people in their history. It's really not something to impress people in history, people seeing this should already be enthusiastic.""",1
"b'I really thought it would be great to watch a movie in 3D and HD ... but unfortunately they did not come up with a way to offer a 3D experience at home without fading the characters.

So, with that, I was thrilled to see this film and relive some of the memories. What a disappointment. It was not scary at all. The people in the theater were actually *** SLEEP ***. I was jealous of them. Mostly I was glad it was a short film. Unfortunately, the scariest thing about this movie was a penguin. Do not see it.

The basic premise is interesting, in a sense to six degrees, and one would expect an Indiana Jones-style adventure with two daggers. There are two worlds, one good, one bad. An ancient civilization once opened the door between these two worlds first and was swept away. Now, the key has been destroyed (why not destroyed? Never destroy these things!) And sent to the four corners of the earth. Now, take everything that's always been clean, exciting, fun, and interesting from an Indiana Jones-style movie and let it scroll down a few times. Dip it and slap it on some film with an inept performance and an inaineous rhythm. From the fire and here you are, Alone in the Dark. What a waste .""",0

"b'Before looking at this, do not make the mistake of heaping this film with stupid comedies like ""Tootsie"" and ""Mrs"". Doubt the fire. \'\' Although based on a true story, the director Greenwald goes around many Western (and Hollywood) conventions to bring one of the best westerns of the 1990s. Susy Amis plays Jo, a woman who is a little too confident of some bad guys. After escaping to the west and leaving her hidden by a child, she was almost raped by two soldiers. To hide from them, wear the clothes of men and scar the face, finally using his new facade to get what he needs in the West to survive. Ian McKellen plays a woman hater who greets her, believing he is a young man. In the end he makes friends with Bo Hopkins, who has had his best role for years, and starts a sheep ranch. He falls in love with a Chinese who has been forced to hire as a cook, and eventually has to fight with a group of cattle trying to catch on and hunt sheep farmers. He looks like Eric Stoltz in his man scenes, and is totally believable. McKellan and Rene Auberjonois have small but crucial roles as older paternal figures that Amis trusts, but eventually light it up. Bo Hopkins is as big as the neighbor that Amis tolerates, makes friends and tolerates. David Chung plays the Chinese man surnamed Tin Man as a sick man and addicted to opium. It looks perfect for the part, scars of life and everything. Heather Graham also has a small part as a lover of Amis, and she does her best. The most amazing aspects of this film are what the film is not. There are no cute scenes of ""Yentl"", where Amis falls in love with a man as a man. The war of the cows, a standard Western plot, never overwhelms history, or comes to a trivial conclusion. The final scenes, with the unmasking of Jo, seem almost a farce, but if you think later, play in a very sincere and moving, especially the reaction of Hopkins. The Greenwald camera transforms a small film into an epic, with beautiful Montana scenery. His screenplay is also very clever, without ever laughing cheaply or the kind of exploitation that a director might have chosen. I highly recommend ""The Little Jo ballad"". ""This is classified (R) for physical violence, violent violence, sexual assault, cold blood, bad language, some nude female scenes, sexual content, sexual references, drug abuse and adult situations.'",1
"b'I bought this DVD without having seen it in the theater or on video. I bought it based on the excellent reviews I saw on the top ten year-end lists. This is one of the few (only?) Major animation works that do not double as musicals. It is based solely on the strength of its characters to tell the compelling story of the young `` Hogarth \'\' (yes, Hogarth!) That makes friends with a giant robot that crashed on the ground in the 50s. Naturally, the military and other adults are suspicious of the seemingly benevolent giant. The real strength of this film is that both adults and children will have fun because it works on multiple levels. It\'s a clever comment on the paranoia of the 50s (without being a heavy hand), an exciting adventure film and a comedy that has humor for adults and children. Both will fall in love with ""Iron Giant"" (voiced by Vin Diesal, from ""Saving Private Ryan"") that will eventually teach us a few things about loyalty and sacrifice. A warning for those with very young children: there are some ""damned"" and ""inferno"" (3 or 4) throughout the film; then his PG rating.'",1
"b""I agree with the review of Shemp Newberg. I have other Stefan Grossman DVDs, which I'm excited about. I took this to start learning the bottleneck.

I suppose I'll look for another intro at the bottleneck. On a positive note, there are terrifying historical clips of bottleneck legends, if you like that stuff (which I do).""",0
"b'Certainly the best Carmen I saw, in addition to the film by Domingo (I did not see the performance of van Otter). The highlights are obviously the soprano performances, at the head of Domashenko and Dashuk; both have the right to play their roles, even if the first one is a little dull - but somehow I do not think that Carmen was a lady of nuances. Just look at their beauty: they are really amazing to look at. I saw a Turandot some nights ago (another production of Zeffirelli) that was ruined as a show because the princess was played by a lady who was the size of a hospitality tent (and she was not even a great singer). Strangely, in this production, the male protagonists raise an eyebrow; they are middle-aged, overweight and visually unconvincing, and this diminishes credibility, given Zeffirelli\'s emphasis on the ""look"" of a production; It is difficult to see how Jose and Escamillo can, in modern language, ""pull"" women like that! OK, maybe the fame of the latter is a factor. As for singing, sopranos excelled, Berti was fine, Acelo mediocre, and one or two of the rather dull support singers. The director and the orchestra were good. As another reviewer noted, it is not hard to believe that every Veronese family was represented on the impressive stage, as well as several tourists. There were more horses on stage than running in the Grand National, and I think I saw my dog, who had been left out for a walk, in one of the scenes. No elephant though. And yes, the constant search for male singers for the conductor\'s inspiration was irritating, but with so many people on stage, it\'s a pity that they did not have to blow up to get the rhythm. But these are quibbles. I liked the performance a lot, more like a show than a great work. I think my dog \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8balso came back very late.'",1

"b""It was the franchise that slugfest fans thought would never happen except in the form of a comic book. After years and years of failed attempts and false departures, the powers that eventually joined. Hoping to take advantage of the successful smash of two successful horror franchises with Freddy vs. Jaso, two of the most famous science fiction creatures tiptoe against Alien Vs. Predator with those annoying humans caught in the middle. There is no clich\xc3\xa9; that this movie does not like. Single-use characters are generally drawn. For example, a bottle cap worn around a character's neck is considered a distinctive trait. The film even manages to include that old chestnut where the characters pass a fireball explosion. Fans waiting for the alien races to start slugging will have to wait almost an hour before their first battle but it's pretty impressive as they launch each other like something from a comic book. Of course, the combat scenes are quite beautiful in all their glory assisted by the CGI, but it is certainly not an endorsement. Master Lance Henriksen is staggering around here as a selfish businessman who provides the only human connection to Alien's other films (it is understood that he is the inspiration for the Bishop in Aliens android). It is only in about a quarter of the film before it is sent quickly. There is an audio commentary by the writer / director Paul W.S. Anderson and actors Lance Henriksen and Sanaa Lathan. They connect together apparently unaware of the narrative chaos that is this film. Also included is an audio commentary by the visual effects supervisor John Bruno and the creator of the creature effects Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr. Anyone wishing to hear this kind of detail will find this informational track. There are three scenes erased for two minutes and include a bit of Predator humor that has been cut correctly. Also included are two trailers and a gallery of comic book covers at Dark Horse's Alien Vs. Series of predators.Alien vs. Predator is not worth the wait and the fans of the comic will feel cheated. The film starts slowly, but once the Aliens and the Raiders start fighting each other, the weak script and the clumsy plot fades mercifully into the background. It's a shame because both of these alien races are ripe for countless story ideas that the subsequent sequels have not been able to capitalize effectively. All we have left is a good paint film by number.""",0

The plot involves the possession of a 12-year-old girl by an ancient demon (there is another type). Murders, a dubious priest and a celebrity are thrown into the mix. It\'s so chilling and realistic how you remember it. If you have a special note, this DVD edition contains about a dozen minutes of ballroom footage - and that\'s a good thing. It was omitted on the day when the films were usually limited to two hours. The descent of the staircase is particularly memorable, not to give too much.'",1
"b'""Battlefield Earth"" is rightly considered one of the worst films ever made. Makes ""Manos, Hands of Fate"" ""a profound, human drama, touching on the suffering in the hands of a sect and"" Plan 9 from Outer Space ""seems a profound meditation on world peace and the dangers of science.` `Battlefield \'\' It has larger plot holes than Swiss cheese - and to think it was a labor of love (!!!)

"b""The third installment of the popular & quot; Beverly Hills Cop & quot; the series is like a distant relative who comes to be with you. At the beginning, you are happy to see them and recover old times, but they certainly quickly consume their welcome. This film reaches that point after about fifteen minutes. Eddie Murphy is back as Alex Foley, Detroit's most unlikely detective outdoor outfield detective. Once again, Axel is fighting with law enforcement, the Beverly Hills police department and the villains who killed his friend. Sounds familiar? Even Serge (Bronson Pinchot) is back, in a desperate and painful scene that seems to go on forever. The director, veteran Murphy Helman John Landis, is acceptable, showing Landis' usual talent for rhythm and acrobatics. The screenplay of the usual reliable Steven deSouza, however, is sadly half burnt. It is never clear what the tone of the image should be. The action scenes are very impromptu and are often played for laughter, while the comic scenes are forced and not funny. History never creates the sense of danger and conflict that is essential for such a film. It is neither a riot of laughter, nor is it even remotely full of suspense. Also, any film that makes Hector Elizondo appear - one of the best actors in the film - has some serious problems. There are two good things about & quot; Cop III. & quot; One is an excellent sequence of action set on a ferris wheel in the amusement park. This is the only exciting part of the film. The other thing I liked was the series of cameos from a variety of famous directors (like George Lucas), a typical Landis gag. At least it gives you something to look for in some pretty boring scenes.""",0
"b'I agree 100% with the comments of another reviewer ... If you love this movie, do not buy this DVD. This version is terrible. I looked at it once and wanted to take the record out, spread it out on my driveway and run over it with my car - repeatedly. Back to the assembly school, Bill Jones. Really insulting for anyone who is a fan of this film. If I could, I would give negative stars.'",0
"b'The acting in this film stinks, laughing. Even Tara Reid can not save this film. What, Reid is a scientist because he wears glasses? He looks more like a gym coach. Is Christian Slater smarter? The direction is almost as bad as some of Ed Wood\'s films. The film may have had a science fiction plot, but the film barely explored any part of the plot. The film is not only ugly, sometimes it\'s boring, only stimulated by the fun of the scripts made horrible and meaningless. Mostly, this film incriminates its director. I give this film two stars out of five. At least this movie had images. I did not hate his stupidity as much as that other film based on a videogame, ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"", which I considered the worst film of his year.'",0
"b'These DVDs have catapulted our sex life. My partner and I have found the ""buttons"" to each other and we are having a lot of fun. Since I\'ve been watching DVDs, one of the things I love to do is to reach it to the maximum, and I\'ve become quite good at perceiving when it\'s at the top and desperate to go further. It seems that you love everything I do during this period, and one of my favorite things is to keep it in that moment of intense desire for as long as possible, and as close as possible to get over it as much as possible, before letting it go down, or going Beyond these techniques, I have answered questions that I have had for a long time about how to please her - just to bring other questions that I had not even considered before. We have become VERY interested in exactly what they want, every time we have sex together. My most recent question is this: do women prefer to get up slowly and then go down a few more times, or would they prefer to stay on the edge for long periods of time? From my point of view, the higher it gets, the longer it stays there, the more rewarding it is for me. When I ask her what she likes, it seems like it\'s all I did at the time. I heard that holding it on the edge called ""sweet torture"", and I would like to have a woman\'s perspective. As I said, we are really in his sexual pleasure, and I attribute this rekindled interest apart to the techniques provided in the videos. I highly recommend, but ONLY if what you want is a super charged sex life! ! !'",1
"b""Great Milestones is an exploration of breeding habits and mating rituals of various types of animals. Interesting aspects of this topic are like the Moon and the tides regulate and synchronize certain elements of the breeding and also how the weather conditions play a role. Not only are terrestrial animals studied, but also some types of underwater creatures are shown. In the second half of this documentary, parents who protect and nurture their newborns are touched. To finish is a look at the young animals that leave home or nest in the struggle to join the circle of life. In just 60 minutes, this feature may leave you wishing for more. The sound, the narration and the video are pretty well done according to me. No bonus features are offered except for a couple of trailers from other programs. The chapters are a bit short due to the time limit, but what is presented is still fun and enjoyable. As different as the animal kingdom, we hope that Reader's Digest will make other types of documentaries. If you are a fan of this type of topic, this is the recommended vision.""",1
"b'I am a Blu-ray enthusiast and a killer of lethal weapons. So, I was VERY disappointed both by the quality of the Blu-ray formatting for this (it seems like the quality of the DVD), but what really made me angry is the fact that it\'s not the director\'s cut. I guess maybe it was a bit naive for me to suppose it would be, but come on, this is BLU-RAY we\'re talking about here! I was not impressed. Not to mention that the seller said it was in ""Good Condition"", but the spine and the back of the sleeve were badly crumpled and torn. If it was a good quality Blu-ray conversion, and it was the director\'s cut, I would never have worried about the crumpled cover. However, as was not the case, the crumpled nature was straw.P.S. I just checked on Amazon, and there\'s no Director\'s Cut available yet. Until there is, I will not buy any lethal weapons movies on Blu-ray.'",0
"b""This series was reminiscent of such series as Trigun, Full Metal Panic and Outlaw Star, nothing serious but fun, dramatic and fun enough to be very compelling. The first thing you need to accomplish is not to take most of this series seriously, even if you're looking for a hardcore drama series like Ghost In The Shell, Akira or the like in this series it will not be for you, while you have fights with space mecha and some dramas for most of the series are mostly carefree for the first season. The start of Vandread Second Stage becomes a little more dramatic and serious, especially with the narrative arc of what the people of the Earth have done to human colonies in space for their own agenda. The main plot of the series is that, after about a century from the male / female sex that separates and lives in different worlds, for whatever reason they started fighting each other for personal resources and programs. The stories of both sides about how the other genres are make the series a lot of fun, like when you listen to the story about the male-born world because of the demonic of the females and the way your organs eat and are just horrible. Thus begins the embarrassing journey of three males trapped on a ship of a multitude of attractive females after a battle between the sexes becomes chaotic and causes a fusion of male and female space ships. The cast has a wide range of humorous situations that create a good laugh during the show and the characters are hilarious as seen while trying to interact between the sexes bumbling along sometimes. The real nice couple in the series for me was Hibiki Tokai, a third-grade citizen of his world who was basically just a humble factory worker when he was trapped aboard the ship because he boasted he could bring a vanguard, and Dita Liebely a female bubbling pilot of the ship who wants to contact her first alien and since she has never seen a male before seeing Hibiki as the first alien she has contacted. The video is clear and clear, so there are no complaints and the sound was good for the cast for both Japanese and English. Although, like the recent releases of Funimation, the set consists of four DVDs inserted into two DVD cases and a paper case, the extras are not only the normal intro / end without text and some trailers but for the price still not bad. So, if you like fun sci-fi action movies, here's a good collection for your anime collection ...""",1
"b'The good news of this DVD is that it focuses more on Big Brother as a band, rather than on Janis Joplin, as other documentaries have. Unfortunately, the sound quality is overall very poor and the images are often faded. This is particularly evident because much of the same footage was used in other films such as JANIS, MONTEREY POP, BIG BROTHER: BALL AND CHAIN, and various special TV (A & E, Biography, VH1 and so on), so also comparisons I\'m easy to do. I have reissues of vinyl records 78 CDs that have been digitally restored to provide a clearer sound of this DVD, and I have seen images of silent films restored in the same way, so I can only assume that this documentary was hastily thrown together with an eye to the fast buck and not much concern for the quality of production. That said, the DVD offers a fascinating look to band members then and now. Some of them look back at the psychedelic era with nostalgic nostalgia, while others obviously cling to and feel their rancor for the last 40 years. If they had never met Janis Joplin, the story of Big Brother could have been very different - if no one would have ever heard of them, or if they had done great things with their ""blues"" terms I will never know. But this DVD offers tempting glimpses not just of what it was, but of what it could have been.'",0

"b""I purchased this DVD as a sock stuffer for my husband. We watched it together in preparation for an upcoming trip to Amsterdam. The film, which tells the life and battles of the Dutch painter, Vincent Van Gogh, was very well done and one of the best shows of Kirk Douglas. Sometimes it was disturbing because of a harrowing depiction of Van Gogh's grave mental illness. Other great renditions of Anthony Quinn, who played the painter Paul Gauguin, and James Donald, who played the role of Van Gogh's brother, enriched the pleasure of the film. The film was visually stunning and one was able to see the evolution of Van Gogh's art. I look forward to my journey to see the art of Van Gogh in person.""",1
"b'With the stellar wattage so high, you could reasonably expect this film to become much brighter. As it is, it is a tired mess that refers to ""thrillers"" much more similar than the 90s. Halle Berry has a friend who is killed in an unusual way, just after confiding to Berry that he was meeting and potentially blackmailing Bruce Willis, a senior flight officer married with an eye for women. Halle Berry, being an investigative journalist, picks up her friend Giovanni Ribisi (the best thing in the film, and the only real acting with any ambiguity connected) to take cover. Or under the covers, it might be more appropriate. He gets in line to meet him in his favorite chatroom, and as a temp in his office he seduces him to get close enough to find out what he needs to know. Needless to say, they follow twists. Let\'s say right away: watching people type instant messages with each other is NOT exciting. And if you\'re expecting a thrill of sexual tension or action on the screen, you\'ll probably be enormously disappointed. Although it is advertised as an erotic thriller, the action is all about the internet and every alleged tension in the story is of the whodunit variety rather than another ... and it\'s a good thing that Willis and Berry do not get dirty and dirty , with the frightening lack of chemistry that they seem to have, and the lack of conviction in their roles that ooze.Ribisi is the only successful wild card in the process that leaves us in doubt about the result. That ending could be a presumed twist, but the credibility of being satisfactory is lacking, since the facts jump out in the end like an economic trick in a funhouse, rather than a stimulating moment that puts together pieces scattered in the film, in the way which a better accomplished effort could have accomplished. Draw with ""the realization of ..."" as the only extra. Perhaps with the ridicule over the replacement of the superior product they did not feel they needed money from the film ...'",0
"b'This is a decent movie but I can not give it a better review because the transfer is terrible. The monogram, ER, of the issuing company shows during the entire film. This is definitely a very low definition version of the film. Perhaps the system by which the company added their monogram made the movie look like it was seen through a gauze. There are also some places where the image breaks down. This is really a shame because I liked the movie.'",0

"b'This DVD offers you incredible performances by some of the best out there: Sheryl Crow, Shawn Colvin, Indigo Girls and Sarah Mclachlan are all brilliant, and even Meredith Brooks and Jewel are in excellent shape. The interviews are fantastic and the backstage jam session with Crow and the Indigo Girls - they are teaching them & quot; I tried to be true & quot; - it\'s a little gem that (as another reviewer has noted) beautifully captures the spirit of Lilith Fair. From a technical point of view: working with the camera is wonderful, with close-ups and big angles for that feeling of being there. In fact I would have given this DVD 5 stars, but for the occasionally spotted sound. I can not comment on 5.1 because I only have a stereo. But I warn you that sometimes the volume drops suddenly and inexplicably; and in a couple of points, the muddy mix cheats the listener, as in the final moments of Crow, otherwise wonderful.

But in a moment of compassion the Elven King decides not to finish the remaining Humans and calls a truce for the Humans to build their cities, but leave the forests to the Elves and the Trolls. Years pass and humans have forgotten the truce and have taken control of much of the land of the Elves and Trolls. The Prince of the Elves has decided that his Father is weak to do something about the Humans and decides it's time to awaken the Golden Army.

"b""NOTICE: this is not really a sequel. This is one of those remakes of television movies / miniseries of a theatrical release. You will not get cinematic visual effects, you will receive images of television quality. Too many people are not providing appropriate reviews and this is more a betrayal of your consumers. The original Tempestators are a fantastic fairytale, it's not like that. This is more like a standard kung fu action shot that uses characters. Storm Riders had that touch of fantasy, this did not. There is a good kung fu action, but this thing seems inconsistent while you are trying to watch it, and this may be because they tried to cut and paste the movie together, if my theory is correct as it was a miniseries adaptation . The story begins and stops without flow. If you just want an action movie with some decent fighting scenes, take this, it's tolerable, but in no way is it on the likes of Storm Riders. I would really like them to set a standard that differentiates TV adaptations from real films, such releases tend to be a bit offensive. The ONLY thing that redeems is a really nice female actor, and that's it! I've never seen Wind and Cloud so unattractive, and this is based on Aaron Kwock and Ekin Cheng. These 2 are appropriate but not substitutive.""",0
"b""Hollywood werewolves have long been characterized by serious creatures that take care of their victims like a Groucho Marx sardine. The image of this fleeing werewolf was originally engraved by Lon Chaney and subsequent generations of actors simply continued his style. But with AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, director John Landis not only pushed the four-legged werewolf so that it resembled nothing but a mobile lycan tank, but also added a touch of much needed humor to force the spectators to stand momentarily apart from the blood to contemplate what they had just seen. David Naughton and Griffin Dunne are two Americans making their way through a grim English moor just outside Heathcliffe's WUTHERING HEIGHTS. They are attacked by a howling werewolf that kills Dunne but only bites Naughton before being shot by villagers. This introductory scene in which Naughton and Dunne are banished from a hostile group of pub-drinkers is a creepy mixture of disturbing fear leavened with sharp spirit. It is precisely this same mixture of horror and humor that suggests that the viewer engages in extreme emotions ranging from laughing to suffocation, with the viewer sometimes unsure of which to choose. Jenny Agutter is a very underrated actress who shines like a nurse who falls in love with Naughton, and can not understand a radical change in her eating habits, as she gets closer and closer to her extremely rare flesh. Agutter adds an unexpected dimension to a role that in the hands of another and less competent director could have relegated her to little more than a delicious piece of English eye candy. Griffin Dunne provides visceral humor like a body that keeps popping up, like the ghost of Hamlet's father, at appropriate times to remind Naughton that the price to pay for being free of lycanthropy may be a little too high. And then there's the music, played more or less like Simon & amp; The texts of Garfunkle from THE GRADUATE, but here the lilting of Credence Clearwater Revival & quot; Bad Moon Rising & quot; punctuates the transformation scenes that break out of the eyes that a bad moon leads to negative vibrations. Finally, the special effects of Rick Baker are astonishing because you can see the bones that stretch, the fur that sprouts and the nostrils that stretch when Naughton sees himself scaring himself as much as the audience. Ultimately, AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF in LONDON is a nuisance in the werewolf genre in that vision and sound combine to present creatures as helpless in their own way as their victims are in theirs.""",1
"b'Amazon to their complete discredit is posting reviews of two totally different films as one! There are two versions of The Big Trail - a 35mm shot and a duration of 110 minutes and released in 2003, and a newer widescreen version released in 2008 lasting over 122 minutes and shot in 70mm Grandeur and completely different in size and impact . The important version, to add more confusion, comes with the first as a box. Potential buyers must be aware of this! The `` Full Screen Edition \'\' will confuse many buyers - in fact it is nothing of the kind and so I point it down to the lowest rating. The film in its historical format deserves a full of FIVE STARS! and can be purchased in the set titled, ""The Big Trail Two Disc Special Edition"", which includes not only this lower version of the DVD, but also the very important and extremely historical ""WIDESCREEN EDITION"" version of the film was shown for the first time. Still, I could easily rate this five-star widescreen DVD! The widescreen version is 122 minutes long and taken directly from the original 70mm. The `` Full Screen Edition \'\' masks here as what is not a cropped version of the widescreen image, but instead is actually a shorter version (110 minutes) of 35mm taken at the same time by Fox for the most part of the theaters of the day that could not shoot the huge film. Yes, it\'s a true film and certainly good - until you see the 70mm. My low rating is to draw attention to all these important details that are not mentioned in most of the positive reviews. Most of what makes this epic film in scale is much more appreciated in a widescreen format, and not in the totally confusing full-screen version proposed here. I am normally tolerant of these media concessions - looking at a widescreen `` Lawrence of Arabia \'on something smaller than a 60-inch screen is like looking at a colored ribbon that runs along the center of the TV. a picture so small is understandable why many people opt for screen versions cut out or ""full"" instead of widescreen versions.But the whole point of ""The Big Trail"" is the magnificent GRANDEUR format, a monstrous image of 70 Stunning details of the vast panoramas that make up the backgrounds of the film are stunning images worthy of consideration with the great black and white photography of the best photographers in the West of America If you have a big TV screen you just have to try "" The Big Trail ""in Widescreen on Fox"" Two Disc Special Edition. ""Once you\'ve seen the film in its complete glory not truncated on a good sized screen, you\'ll wonder why Fox has released ""The Big Trail"" in 2003 in a very changeable and very misleading ""Edit Screen Edtion"". To order the widescreen version of `` The Big Trail \'\' and see a landmark in American cinematography, something absolutely as spectacular as it should have been seen. The Big Trail (Two-Disc Special Edition) My only complaint is Fox Insist on connecting the full-screen DVD to the Widescreen DVD and uploading for two DVDs when most viewers want to see only one version.'",0
"b'While the 2006 Le Mans DVD is similar to previous incarnations, extremely poor video quality due to a large amount of distortion and pixelation, makes this the worst of Le Mans DVDs. Regarding the content, are the same things: a lot of tests and qualifying highlights with just over an hour dedicated to the actual race. However, poor image quality makes this DVD look like a VHS tape. Distortion and pixelation are sometimes horrible and really stand out from the pleasure of watching the race. If you compare this DVD side by side with the Le Mans DVDs covering the races of 2002 and 2003, the 2006 edition is much worse. Another complaint is that the DVD covers two highlights of tests and qualifications twice - adding a lot of repetitions to the DVD ""s Running time of 140 minutes.This was a constant habit for the producers of this series, which they concentrated in this show that was originally broadcast on the SPEED channel before the live broadcast of Le Mans.This preview show, which takes just over an hour to cover tests and qualifications, leads to the true beginning of the DVD, which then he goes back to further testing and qualifying highlights.The lack of special features and in-car cameras is another disappointment.In 2005 DVD, producers included for the first time special car camcorders (although the DVD featured some pixelation problems.) In the 2006 version, there are no special features and the camera film in the car is no more than a couple of seconds for each car it shows. ndioso if there was a complete lap in the car on the Audi R10 Turbo Diesel. Overall, I would still recommend this DVD to all Le Mans fans because it is the best record of a race that saw Audi triumph with a diesel-powered car for the first time in the history of the 74-year race. He also does a good job showing all the action of the race and all the drama and glamor that makes up the annual resistance festival on the Circuit de la Sarthe.

Although I have to admit that some of the special effects generated by the computer were impressive, the acting had no substance whatsoever. However, what bothered me the most was the incredible amount of product placement throughout the film. Mr. Spielberg was not sure he would make enough money at the box office to advertise Aquafina, Pepsi, Gap, Lexus and Nokia throughout the film? Overall I spent two and a half hours in the film during which I asked myself more than once if all the people who were shooting in the cinema during the screening of the film, bored like me?

"b'It\'s my fault if I had higher expectations on this film, but I guess this movie was not made for guys like me. The acting is ok, the character of Matthew McConaughey, Ben and Kate Hudson, Andie just have to act and react. Dialogue does not matter. The character of Kate Hudson always has the upper hand, which is fine for a while, but after an hour it becomes tiring. She completely invades every aspect of Ben\'s life; we never see Andie\'s world apart from his two friends and the workplace. So, while both characters have a similar program, there is a total imbalance between the top hands, and this for me is the biggest flaw in the film. He endures all his attempts to ""lose him"", but all of this only produces frustration in Andie - and pushes her to do more crazy things. As a spectator you are dying to see her fall on her face only once. But this is wishful thinking. Ben\'s ability to recover from Andie\'s antics hardly intrigues me, and Andie\'s total lack of shame does not go along with me. Of course they both look great, and Hudson smiles positively when he smiles, but man, 112 minutes is a long time to endure this game. I can imagine that some people think this film is fantastic. Girl Power and everything. I do not know . But I think we can agree that the film was conceived as a vehicle for Kate Hudson\'s rise to fame. This film reminds me a little WHAT WOMEN WANT (with Mel Gibson) for a number of reasons, but mainly because it was written and produced by women - that in the world of men\'s cinema is a much-needed perspective - but Nancy Myers ( the producer / director of What Women Want) is definitely smarter than the ""brain"" of How to Lose A Guy in 10 Days. You just have to look at the DVD extras to see the proof. We meet two of the producers, both of whom obviously have a facelift. I\'m serious . It\'s disturbing . They talk about the material as if it were Shakespeare. Then there is the director Donald Petrie, who totally lacks any charisma. The fact of being with him is so cheap that it\'s probably more fun to watch than most of the movie. While sitting there chatting, a TV monitor behind him shoots still images from the film, and a clerk (with her back to the camera) stares at a static PC screen as she bites her nails and shakes her head a lot. He does it for the duration of the interviews with Petrie. Oh, and did I mention the background music that accompanies the extras? It\'s the music of department stores. Or lift music. Which one you hate the most. I did not care about the comment. Donald is boring. There are no outtakes, which is now unusual for a comedy. The deleted scenes are actually good, some honest emotions are shown by Andie and we get some more calm and private moments between the two protagonists. Look, everything started ok. It looked like a harmless and harmless romantic comedy, but the love story lasted about 10 minutes. I can summarize my review with this observation of the reason of the director Petrie who is interested in directing the film. He says it was because he discovered that Kate Hudson was connected to it. Aha. So basically, if the film is good at the box office, then it will launch Hudson AND\'s career. Sorry Petrie, but it\'s not good enough for me.'",0
"b'""Ring Around the Rosie"" features the participation of Gina Philips (""Jeepers Creepers"") and Tom Sizemore (""Saving Private Ryan""). I was interested in their name, but unfortunately the film is terribly boring, even if it lasts less than 90 minutes.Gina Philips plays Karen, a young businesswoman who inherits a house in a remote place in the country, which may or may not be persecuted Near the house lives a caretaker played by Tom Sizemore, who may or may not be possessed by something evil. The premise is all too familiar, used recently in films like ""The Amityville Horror"" and with the right direction the film would be electrifying. But soon you will realize that there are no chills of any kind, not even a surprise with a sudden sound, in ""Ring Around the Rosie"" which introduces many fragments of recycled images seen in other thrillers - from rudimentary tricks like shadows that move behind the door, a strange reflection in the mirror, a strange noise in midnight or unreliable the neighbor staring at the protagonist, the heroine tormented by nightmares and buried memories of the past. The film also features Karen\'s amiable boyfriend (Randall Batinkoff) and his adorable younger sister (Jenny Mollen). The first leaves the house while Karen stays to clean the house; the latter arrives there and what Karen sees and hears begins to become foreign. Considering the nature of the conclusion and the suggested story of Karen\'s childhood (which I can not reveal here), there may be some psychological explanations about the strange events that terrorize Karen, as in thrillers like ""The Others"". \'\' It\'s what I thought while trying not to sleep, but no matter how I try, I can not find one in this disconnected story that is confusing and illogical. If you see a character fall out of the window and another character takes her in his arms in a cartoon way, you realize that this is not a good psychological thriller. Or maybe I\'m thinking too much. Probably this is another badly written horror movie that you could find in your video store, borrow it and regret it later. Whatever it is, I was bored, and that I can say quite confident.'",0
"b""I thought this movie was fantastic. It made me curious at first, warm in love scenes, sad to the end, and happy and optimistic now. Topher Grace is wonderful in this movie, I must say that it's her best! I immediately fell in love with his character and I just hope to meet someone like him one day.""",1
"b""The title derives from the idea that serial killers have degrees in homicide, although I would have thought that the commit of mutiple deeds would have downloaded them into the post-graduate territory. The 4 assassins mentioned here - Charles Manson, Henry Lee Lucas, Ottis Elwood Toole and Kenneth Bianchi - receive disproportionate coverage. Manson is not seen at all, which can be a blessing considering the only crazy interview I've seen him give. Henry Lee Lucas also has a short turn, but his teammate Ottis Toole has perhaps the most troubling situation. Although sentenced and imprisoned for what is said to be an incredible number of 700 murders, with Lucas, Toole gives the impression of not having done any of them. This does not mean that it is totally free of crime, since it freely admits of various acts of arson, but claims to have confessed to the murders according to the information provided by the police, that he wanted to be guilty and therefore forced them. Kenneth Bianchi's study, known as Hillside Strangler, also touches on this behavior that psychiatrist Martin T Orne defines as manual sociopathy. But while it is easy to believe that Bianchi in his interviews pretend, it is more difficult to accept that Toole is, with his vagabond character and smiling face. Perhaps this makes Toole the best actor, since Orne also believes that Toole is a serial killer. Bianchi's initial defense for his murders was the disturbance of multiple personalities, and when Dr. Orne proved him a fake, denying the testimony of other psychiatrists, Binachi dropped the charade and was found guilty, though the plea bargain for evidence against his accomplice decreased the number from 14 vicendims to 7. This video was made in 1987 and it is said that Bianchi was at liberty in the 90s, something that Dr. Orne believes to have a good chance to get since the tactics of Bianchi has no remorse, no memory was winning him alliances. However, while Toole's face reveals an idiot child amused by his own game, Bianchi is the banality of evil, an insignificant surface that can not be trusted. The video ends with serial killer survivors, including Sharon Tate's mother, who meet regularly to monitor court hearings for convicted murderers. One can only ask if they were able to influence the release of Whites, since Orne predicts that once this form of obsessive / compulsive behavior has been implemented, it can not be stopped. According to the dott. Orne, no matter how good a Bianchi prisoner was, once free he would start again. Some may think it a pity that these men escaped the death penalty in the states where it was abolished, and the idea that life imprisonment is a worse form of punishment than execution is diluted by conditional freedom and good conditions behavioral services. This may sound harsh, but Dr. Orne says there is no method of civil punishment effective enough to be a deterrent - the best you can do is keep the authors isolated from the rest of society. There are no parallels drawn between the killers seen here, no resemblance that could explain what triggered their actions. If we can not understand their behavior, at least we can be grateful that it has been stopped, at least for a while.""",0
"b'This is the way this film was advertised when it came out in 1981, in the classic sense of the universal monster ""a movie of monsters"". \'\' As a divorced child, I had a weekend dad who would take my sister and me in any film, regardless of the assessment (well, within limits) and this scared us. I remember sitting in the theater and witnessing the transformation (having seen the transformation of Lon Chaney Jr. into ""The Wolfman"" ""I knew the lineage of the genre and the example that this film had to live until ... after seeing ""The howl"" later (not long after, since the movies were almost competing with each other dramatically) I was a huge fan of Rob Bottin and his mentor, Rick Baker (not to mention the deceased, great Dick Smith and splatter master, Tom Savini), I was simply glued to the screen during one of the most interesting effects of all time, simply amazed by what was happening, and I scarcely scared the credibility of all this with respect to the stop-motion transformation of Chaney\'s makeup) not to mention the scene with David Naughton (`Be a Pepper! Drink Dr. Pepper!) and Jenny Agutter in bed (not to mention the shower) ... yowza! (Well, I was 11 years old.) The only thing that ever got me This movie\'s lack is one of what should be an extremely bloody scene that Landis cut because it overwhelmed the scene that came later (presumably, the audience was so disgusted and upset that they stammered through the whole scene of the dialogue that followed David waking up in the pen of the wolf at the zoo): the scene was represented by the impregnable murders of the bums near the pier, and I do not think it comes to this new DVD version of the film (which is a pity, because the gore Robocop\'s foam of Verhoven (Criterion edition) sounds better than the version approved by MPAA). In any case, this is really a great `` monster movie \'\' in every sense of the word ... it\'s gross, funny, sexy, exploitative in many ways (the book ""Splatter Movies"" calls it ""gore porn""), truly a Landis film by way of ""in"" jokes and orgy of automotive chaos, and offers great acting and casting (even in small roles like the Pakistani hospital turnist and the London Underground punks). Only a fun movie in the round, with truly amazing effects and Oscar winners (still incredible and credible ... nothing digital approaches!) I repeat: digital is not there yet ... transformation seems to be skeletony, painful , horrible and relaxes the imagination in more than one way). In conclusion, I waited forever for this damn DVD ... the first edition of the DVD was poor and it went out so quickly, I was lucky enough to find a copy of the video store to rent. No extra on that ... but this is the one to own.'",1
"b'About the only thing wrong with this image is the title. Adapted from the Thomas Harris novel ""Red Dragon"", the decision was made to change the title. I probably thought that most American film-goers thought it was a Kung Fu movie or something. Probably right This is also before the most acclaimed sequel ""The Silence of the Lambs"" by the same author. It is another great film by Michael Mann that exudes style and substance. Style can annoy some people. It is shot with various unnatural shades including purple, blue and green. Although perhaps they are not realistic, they always seem to adapt to the scene. Mann and his photographer put the cameras in interesting places. Take for example the bare white cell of Hannibal Lector (Brian Cox). We see both Lector and Will Graham (William Petersen) centered between the same 2 bars, with quick cuts back and forth. Another camera hovers over the room. However, this film is not really about Dr. Lector. This is a serial killer known as The Tooth Fairy (Thomas Noonan - really disturbing). While Petersen struggles with his own sanity, he lives in the killer using his ability to get into the killer\'s head. He stole this theme for his TV series of ""Miami Vice"" in this same period. Another great tactic for which Mann is known is the use of music. Here we get an original soundtrack by The Reds and Michel Rubini, not to mention the incredibly cool climatic scene with Iron Butterfly\'s In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.'",1
"b""Once in a blue moon, comes a pleasure of the crowd that makes the spirit fly. `` Strictly Ballroom '' is one of those films. Directed in an exquisite high-key style by Baz Luhrmann (WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE 's ROMEO + JULIET, MOULIN ROUGE) in his crazy debut (the first in what would be called Red Curtain Trilogy), the film tells the story of a tall dancer quality that mates with a horrible ugly left duckling, when his anti-conformist style makes him gain the disdain of his more conventional colleagues. Together they give the maximum and aim to make the dreams of the National Championship title come true. To say that this film is surprising would be a euphemism. It is one of the most gloriously entertaining and provocative films ever made. The cast is simply magnificent and Luhrmann presents here his style of directing and intelligent and fast editing. He brilliantly uses a documentary style opening and oclean interludes that help to better understand the adorable characters. It works wonderfully! This is definitely the good mood movie of the decade. It is hypnotic, strange and deeply felt - a pleasure for the delightfully entertaining crowd. A recommended must!""",1
"b""I love the first two films of Anne of Green Gables. I saw them for the first time on PBS and I had the original VHS tapes released by Disney. Sullivan's first DVD releases had very poor audio and visual quality. This new, expensive set combines the four films together, all in 16x9 widescreen format. I do not like the other two films, so I will comment only on the first two. These were originally shot in 4x3 format, with television in mind (I read that they might have played theatrically abroad). I'm not an expert, but these new widescreen formats look cropped. Thus, information is lost with these new transfers. Is it so bad? Yes, because I believe that the original aspect ratios of these films should be 4x3 (or 1.33: 1) as originally transmitted. Worse, the image quality seems to be so digitally clean that many originally visible details are no longer visible. The sound seems OK; the default setting is the original 2.0 stereo mix. Annoyingly, the subtitles seem to have been made by Nitwit. For the first film, the first album (fortunately, every film has two records) has a good caption. The second disc has the subtitle ALL IN HATS FULL and is full of errors. Very poor quality! ! At this price point, I would not advise fans to rebuy these movies if they are already owned. However, like FYI, I contacted Sullivan Entertainment and said they were not going to publish movies on Blu-ray.""",0
"b'What a waste of money this was. They did not even have Justin sing a song, so I could see if I wanted to buy his other DVD.'",0
"b'A sequel to director Ridley Scott ""Alien"" was inevitable, of course. This traditional horror film set in outer space has simply made too much money for the studio to just let it stand up. Surprisingly, when director James Cameron took over, he was determined to make a different film rather than just the first rehash. So, ""Aliens"" was adventurous, bringing the story in new and exciting directions as a plot of adventure and adventure instead of another horror film. In fact, a number of critics believe that ""Aliens"" is better than ""Alien"". `` But now comes `` Alien 3 `` - as unnecessary a sequel to an important film as we have seen for some time. Director David Fincher and four writers have created another horror film, attempting the existential nuances while making the alien in this Ripley film ""Moby Dick"". `` But `` Alien 3 `` starts by changing the end of its predecessor and knocking down almost all the characters we care about. Fans will remember that Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Hicks, Newt and the android Bishop escaped in a spaceship at the end of ""Aliens"". \'But this movie starts with their expulsion from the ship and the crash landing on a prison planet, which kills them all except Ripley! On this planet of maximum security, where lice infestation requires everyone to be bald, Ripley discovers that the solitary surviving monster is still with them. Soon, he is organizing prisoners to be on the alert, but since there are no weapons of any kind on the planet, they end up playing hide and seek with the creature for most of the film. There are many problems with this film, but the worst is its sad and obscure reason; the lack of friendly characters; the unpleasantness of the film\'s premise, which at Ripley eventually discovers she has an alien queen growing inside her; and a long sequence of chases that is so obscure, and so chaotic that it becomes confusing. Those looking for chills or an improvement in the first films will be very disappointed. Those looking for a headache will be in the right place. And why is it ""Alien 3 (that is, in cubes)"" instead of ""Alien 3"" or ""Alienz"" or ""Alien: One of those Slobbering Monsters survive after all"" - is probably just a gimmick to convince writers like me to meditate on the application and give the film a little more ink. It worked.'",0
"b'As many reviews show, if you love this film, you\'ll really * love * it; if you hate it, you really hate it. Since I\'ve already seen it twice and I\'m ready to see it again, you can fit me firmly into the first category - I was not transported and moved from a film by ""The Fountain"" (which evoked similar reactions of love or disdain in viewers) . It requires the voluntary suspension of silly cynicism, which I suspect may be a critical point for some ... but if you are willing to open your mind, and your heart even more, you will be amply rewarded. The plot is simple, as it should be: a thread woven through the lives of different characters, which transports them through the great events of the \'60s. Wealth comes in the evocation of the times, in the countless little details that revolve around the characters. And, above all, when everything is said and done, this is a love story, wonderfully and emotionally told. If you\'ve ever felt the intense emotions expressed in these beautiful songs, you\'ll identify yourself with Jude & Lucy, Sadie & JoJo and all their friends. Not only romantic love, but genuine love for others as brothers and sisters, all together in this confusing and exhilarating world. So, are there any embarrassing moments or scenes that are a little too precious for contemporary tastes? Obviously ! But that does not matter, because one of the distinctive elements of the \'60s was the desire to take ridiculous opportunities, to risk appearing silly, or even to collapse on one\'s face. I am pleased that Julie Taymor has taken similar risks here, because it helps to capture the sensitivity of that moment, a sensitivity that has led to extraordinary creativity and innovation. And it\'s not just about that moment. The questions of useless war, of demonizing the Other, of intolerance and fear of change, of mistrust in the imagination - are not as powerful today as they have ever been? But while the film is definitely on the side of the counterculture at its best, Julie Taymor does not hesitate to show how even the best idealistic intentions can go to the dark places, as with some demonstrators passing to the bombs. A paean of peace and love, is also well known by pain and despair. The film ends with the anthem, ""All You Need Is Love"", a song that has been denied by some as a desperate, naive and dated flower power artifact. But I can think of something that George Harrison once said, when he was asked if love was * all * you need - he replied that even if it\'s not * all * you need it, if you do not have it, then what do you need the rest? Yes, it is a shining cloud and illuminated by the sun of golden nostalgia in a certain sense ... but it is also a reminder that there is more in the life of fear and obscurity, that there is hope even in the midst of madness and chaos. And in this sense, it is very much a contemporary film, with a vital message. Highly, happily recommended!'",1
"b'I was disappointed to have this movie for the price. However, I was pleased w / the shipment. I highly recommend anyone trying to buy it or save their money and rent it or try to get it really cheap. The film was not quite what I hoped it would be.'",0
"b""This film was generally overlooked at the time of release. Predating Lone Star and Thunderheart, this film has three surprising things: (1) the cast is stellar. Take Dafoe, in a good boy role, Emmett Walsh as a lazy coroner, Mary Elizabeth Mastronantino in an incredible lead role, Sam Jackson (as listed in the credits), which snatches the scene, Mickey Roarke in GOOD performance, and also a ungrateful ungrateful role. (2) the plot is much better than No Way Out. With Donaldson's direction, you might think it would just be a remake / remodal, but the plot keeps spinning, and once you think you've even come away, BANG something other happens. (3) the scenario is surprising. The only film that comes close to capturing the feel of the new Mexican landscape is Backtrack, which is also very good. The widescreen adds (although it's fair to wonder when it does not), so if you were like me and had not seen it until it came out on VHS, you're ready for a surprise. Not everything works - keep waiting for Dafoe to become the creep that is in most of his films since Wild at Heart, or Roarke does not make much sense, but like Angelheart, it's focused and amazing here, but it does not happen. there are a lot of extras (maybe there's an edition of a director somewhere with more than Mimi Rogers, but as it is, this is a fantastic movie, four out of five stars.""",1
"b""I was breathless after watching This Is It on Blu-ray. The amount of time, love, passion, ingenuity and scrupulous effort for the perfection that Michael Jackson has put into his work is so impressive. No wonder he's the king of pop!""",1
"b""All right, you would think it's a common knowledge, but apparently not as common as we all realized. 'Starboard' is right. 'Port' remained. It is obvious from the direction in which the helmsman turns that the director, the producers, the cast and the film crew are all a group of landowners who deserve to get off the boat. This is not the only mistake in the film, nor the most obvious. There are many other issues in this production that have already been discussed - the fact that you know what will happen before it starts, the crew that shoots passengers, the length of the film, Leonardo DiCaprio - to name a few. While everyone does not distract excessively, on the whole make the film a little disgusting for those who do not like reading romance novels 24-7. Also for this purpose, the love story is stupid (for lack of my effort to find a better description). The only thing that saves the whole thing is the whole, which is simply spectacular. They have spared no expense to build the replica of the ship, and this shows. Two stars for the sets and nothing else.""",0
"b'A story within a story on a cruise ship: the surface story is of a ""seven-year itch"". A tired and respectable English couple, without children, who celebrates that volatile aniversary, is carelessly advised (as far as her husband is concerned) by an Indian sage that children are a better conjugal therapy than a cruise in India. Lust takes the place of apparently conservative English played Hugh Grant perfectly and makes fun of him. Yes, this always happens to men. On board a cruise, the British couple encounters the sexy French mermaid and the older crippled husband, who hooks up with her English husband to tell her never published autobiographical novel. And as for the writer\'s inner story and his French obsession, he shows how the greed of hedonistic fantasy can lead to obscure, sadistic or at least deplorable behavior. Needless to say, everyone learns this lesson in their own way in the end. A subtle theme here is the representation of the failed writer, who too often fills his imagination and tries to make life imitate art until his life and his art meet any success, (this, like lust in seven-year-old male itchiness, it\'s another truism - failed artists often go too far into fantasy to give up realism that ultimately causes frustration and failure) as well as telling his story orally to a simple jerk on a cruise who he completely misses the point and is ready to collect his perfectly respectable life for a brief scandalous trist in the same way that made the cripple such an unbearable, hateful loser. Much like the song of Siren of Homer (who was also sailing in the Mediterranean, is not it?) Great soundtrack also by Vangelis, which captures romance and tragedy in one theme.'",1
"b""As another reviewer, I am not able to load the DVD on my Toshiba SD-1200 player. I own several DVDs and have seen many rentals and have never had any problems like this before. I'm quite disappointed because I'm both a fan of Hitchcock and Criterion. Note: I contacted Criterion about it after sending my review.

"b""This review is only about blu-ray, since there are many reviews here on the film itself and there are only so many ways to say that the film is brilliant. I was a little skeptical about this blu-ray because I had read that it was not so much an update from the Jane Doe edition. Technically, it may be true, but the truth is that this is the best Fletch has ever seen and could be the best ever. I do not know if they can invent a format that can breathe too much life in a comedy from the mid-80s that was not originally intended / intended to be a visual spectacle. Yes, this film does not look like The Departed on Blu-ray, but it's an improvement over the DVD and it's really all you can ask for. For $ 10, it's hard to beat and for me it's a breeze if you're a fan of the movie.""",1
"b""I would recommend this movie for adults and children. It has something interesting for all age groups. There is a beautiful southwestern enchanting landscape, as the story takes place in the southwestern desert of Arizona, in the lands of the Navajo. There is also a story of two young boys who have lost the goat, and think that he has wandered into a canyon known as & quot; Cougar Canyon & quot; a place that should be infested, according to the Navajo legend. They have to go look for the goat, of course, and they are plagued by many dangerous misadventures before they can accomplish their mission. The true stars of this film, however, in addition to the beautiful scenery, are the superb photography of desert fauna in its natural habitat. There is a battle between a badger and a puma, or a wildcat, as it is more commonly known, with a surprise ending. The close-up of a diamondback rattlesnake is fantastic, and even the narration is superb. This film is reminiscent of the old series of documentaries on the nature of Disney that came on television years ago, in the '70s. I enjoyed it immensely, and I am an old man, but I can see where children might like it, since they are usually fascinated by wild creatures like rattlesnakes, wild cats, black bears, etc. in their natural environment. In reality it is very educational, especially for us city dwellers. I can not say enough good things about this movie, you just have to see it for yourself.""",1
"b'The auditor who is right in these pages is the one who calls the fact that Jonathan Larson conceived ""Rent"" as more work (using ""La Boheme"" as inspiration), not a musical. And what it means is that the liaison dialogue is sung in the voice of the stage, not chatted as dialogue. So, see Jesse L. Martin forced to speak dialogues like ""I re-wired the ATM at the Food Emporium"" when you know he\'s killing him to not sing it and he\'s killing every Rent fan in the same way to hear him forced just by putting words into his mouth. .. well, it\'s a big flaw because it inflicts great blows on the flow and energy of Larson\'s work. Other concerns: * The first half of the play was revisited rather effectively - by-shot. So, in a bizarre way (given loyalty in the first half), the second half distorts the original. The director Colombo wastes too much time staging ""Take me or leave me"" in a way that is not intended. Fun, no doubt, but the additional 5 to 10 minutes it was performed may have been used to keep the deleted scenes intact. * Deleted scenes are not matters for the family: ""Rent"" is a difficult story to follow for units. Each of those scenes could help explain the plot. * Surely one of the reasons to support ""Take Me or Leave Me"" was to get more Idina Menzel. [Menzel (the original Elephaba in ""Wicked"" and the original Maureen here) has ascended the Broadway royals, so who can blame Columbus? ] But, if so, why skip ""Happy New Year?"" Which presents a good amount of Maureen? * The deleted scenes end up de-emphasizing Mark by Anthony Rapp, who is unlucky because it\'s the voice and the common thread in the game Leaving out his\' 3D IMAX of my mind ... this is poetic ... the \'pathetic\' number is a great ommission, both for Rapp as an actor and for anyone trying to follow the movie - this is the key piece that puts things in perspective for the viewer in terms of time, because otherwise Larson strives to put the lines in Rapp\'s monologue as ""Christmas ... last Christmas Eve"" ""He is framing the scenes for us. This would be a three-star review, but I go for four because of the saving nature of the beautiful Larson family documentary - this is very powerful stuff. It is obvious that the family is still suffering deeply 10 years after their loss.'",1
"b'As a child of the 70s, Schoolhouse Rock was a Saturday morning tradition such as pajamas, cartoons and cereal.

You would think that nobody in this film trained because everyone is out of shape and out of the combat choreography. There is not a good soundtrack and the music they play is boring.

"b'This is a 70s horror movie based on the bestseller book of the ""real"" story of a haunted house on Long Island. It has been debunked and shown to be a total fiction, but the film generated a dozen sequels and also the necessary remake. The Lutz family buys the home of their dreams only to find out that it is haunted and also contains the passage to Hell in the basement. Yes, it is completely and absolutely overwhelming to think that if such a passage existed in something called Hell, it would be in Amityville, on Long Island. James Brolin plays her husband, a tough man with a lot of hair. Margot Kidder is his wife, who can react with big and big eyes every time he witnesses a ghost, a hallucination, an atrocity, etc. Most of the fears are really opening doors or something, looking at something, and then the music gets really loud, and then we see people\'s eyes, closer, and then, da-da! A special effect of cheese. Good for the value of nostalgia. The appearance of Rod Steiger as a crazy priest is an important advantage. As an economic exorcist.

"b""I do not like this movie. It deserves 5 stars for a superb acting, a horrible and heartbreaking story based on real stories, sad sets and photographs and a feeling of pervasive despair. A German journalist, Nina Hoss, as the dark-eyed, unintentional and unintentional siren, remains behind Berlin to document the invasion of the Russians (Soviets). Soon, he finds himself involved in rape and destruction of the city, and it is a question of defenseless civilians. After repeated attacks on herself, in desperation, she looks for a protector and finds a mysterious Russian officer (Evgeny Sidikhin) with a bewitched past. Interested in her, but somewhat reluctant, she agrees, and what follows becomes a history of relationships and common ground between hell on earth. Without wishing to justify it, the writers, to a certain extent, show both sides of the conflict. The Russians, in general, want their families, hate the war that has dragged them in there and tell terrible memories of the atrocities that the Germans have placed on their homeland. Paying evil for evil does not make their actions right in any way, but I suppose it brings some sort of balance and understanding to the story. Fortunately, the assaults are shown not for free, and there is a scene of nudity to make a point, but that's all for the graphic shots. But you get the message. The whole movie is depressing. I think the only feeling of hope comes from the heroine's desire to survive, to maintain her sanity and a sense of decency, whatever. The written epilogue is almost equally disturbing.

Have you ever seen Toy Story? Ok, the dinosaur is 90 minutes of dino-despair. Each time brings more death and depression. Yes, there is a happy ending, but I even wanted to get there? Sure, the animation and the scenes were very nice - but this was a departure from what people know about Disney. I was disappointed with this.""",0
"b'I could become lyrical for this film forever but I will not! In my opinion, the greatest musical ever produced, ""The Music Man"" was heard in my native Great Britain. I got it when it was broadcast on TV early in the morning about 15 years ago and I\'ve loved it ever since. Robert Preston is Harold Hill and proves to be a fantastic movie actor whose film credits are depressed in a few - even if you have not already seen him, take a look at ""Victor / Victoria"". Shirley Jones does a performance that, after \'Oklahoma! \'e\' Carousel \', shows that he can act! All support players are also excellent, with emphasis on Paul Ford and Hermione Gingold (still few cinematic appearances) such as Shinns, Pert Kelton as Mrs. Paroo and The Buffalo Bills as All-Singing All-Harmonizing School Board . much better than a film than a theatrical show, the ode of Meredith Willson from her childhood in Iowa is perfectly captured by Morton DaCosta, whose direction is as theatrical as that of \'Auntie Mame\', but which is very well suited to nature a little \'unreal of the plot. The musical notes are practically all the songs, but a short list includes ""Trouble"", ""Trombones"", ""Marian the Librarian"" and ""The Sadder But Wiser Girl"".'",1

"b'`` 28 Days Later \'\' is easily the best horror film I\'ve seen in a long time. What impressed me most was his intelligence; in the sense, the suspension of disbelief was very manageable. Once the idea that a virus hit someone that way and spread so quickly, the rest of the plot was perfectly logical to me. The few questions I had were quite easily discovered on a beer with my friends. When I heard that they were doing a sequel, I got excited and I marked my calendar. Opening night, first show after I got out of work I was there. Three hours later I was banging my head on a table and wondered if there was enough beer in the world to make sense of what I had just seen. `` 28 weeks later \'\' should become a case study in film schools about how to take everything well on a fantastic film and set it aside for the sequel. As mentioned in some other reviews, the holes in the plot are huge and inexorable. My ""favorites"" are: 1) the children leave the security area and we even see soldiers in the watchtower let them go, 2) nobody is monitoring or protecting the infected (but not symptomatic) survivor, 3) her husband is so stupid to kiss her, and 4) no matter how many city blocks the little boy is frantically driven, his dad ""out of his mind"" appears quickly and focuses on attacking him and him alone. I could not wait to see the virus spread among the crowd, as was told in the first film. No . What happens when the fan hits the train station? The lights go out and we are given a series of quick and stroboscopic shots. Wow thank you . Unless you\'re epileptic, there\'s nothing scary about it. I give these two stars mainly because I could not give ""Days"" seven. Well, let\'s call him one for the opening sequence and one for the finale. If it had not been for the promise of seeing France arrive in the next, this film would have completely transformed me into a future ""28 Anything"".'",0
"b'This review is for Underworld in its Blu-Ray incarnation. I\'ve just finished watching the movie and all I can say and think about is ""AMAZING""! ! ! The image and the sound are simply incredible. This is the kind of film that should and should be used in an electronics store to demonstrate the advantage that Blu-Ray has in both image and sound compared to standard DVD. Do not look at the incredible plot, acting and computer-generated graphics. It was a film that attracted me from the beginning and never let me go until the end. Credits are rolled. I\'m looking forward, now, to see the sequel ""Evolution of the underworld"". If you only get a science fiction / horror film on Blu-Ray seriously consider this film.

"b""There are pleasant surprises in this film: Tori Spelling's comic ability, a beautiful original music, a pretty cute cast and a premise full of comic possibilities - two cute New York City guys trying to find a place to have sex. But it would take much better writing and character development to make this become the desperate farce that it is looking so hard for. Nice try, though, and there are some prizes. Gabriel (Christian Campbell), an aspiring songwriter with an eccentric smile, picks up Mark (John Paul Pitok), a darkly seductive and muscular Go-Go Dancer (they still call him that?), In the subway. This is his fantastic (rightfully) man who comes to life. The two return to Gabe's apartment where they find his best bubbly and egocentric friend (Spelling), an actress, who prints 150 r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9s. Is a VERY audition planned, n'est-ce pas? It's the first of a series of frustrating attempts to be alone, and while there are some fun moments to be sure, the comic results are questionable. The straight roommate introduces himself with his makeup and throws them out. In their continuous search for privacy they meet a Broadway queen, a drag queen and other characters, each more self-absorbed than the last. And they call the '70s the & quot; I & quot; decade! Absolutely no one notes that Mark and Gabe, holding hands and waving and hinting, might simply want to be alone. Gabe can not blow the horn and just say it. It's like an episode of extended sitcom. Finally, after a whole night of knowledge of Mark, with some pleasant private moments along the way, Gabe insulted him as if it were just a trick. Mark, in the life of the reel, is much more tolerant and sweet than a wonderful piece can be in real life, so it seems like things will be fine. Worth watching just for the cute cast. He deserved only three stars, but this achieved up to four.""",1
"b""Based on a true story, CALENDAR GIRLS by Nigel Cole is an extravagant, moving but sometimes banal film. Banal only because there are many times when nothing of real importance happens, and the crisis points are predictably rude and exaggerated. But a delicious cast still manages to entertain. The idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b50+ natural women is difficult to understand, but these ladies are so elegantly attractive and the calendar is held with taste, you can not help but get caught when the calendar becomes an international success. Helen Mirren, long since an Oscar, brings her role as Chris, the instigator of the calendar, to a wonderful fruition. Ciaran Hinds (Sum of All Fears, Lara Croft Cradle of Life) is very good as her husband, whose offensive comment to a sneaky journalist causes a rift in their marriage. Julie Walters (nominated for an Oscar for Educating Rita) plays Mirren as a widow whose husband's death inspires the calendar. The other women, Annette Crosbie and Penelope Wilton in particular, are all very skilled in their performances. It is not a film that shakes the earth, but a true edifice because it shows that beauty is not relegated to the young, perhaps to the young at heart.""",1
"b""Before seeing The Girl Next Door, I expected it to be a typical teen porn movie. After watching it, it became one of my favorite movies, if not my favorite. It's a love story and a comedy gathered in one person. Emile Hirsch plays Matthew Kidman, a senior high school student who's an excellent student and a good all-round guy, but he's kind of a nerd and he's not really done nothing memorable during the whole high school. This changes when he meets his new neighbor, Danielle, played by Elisha Cuthbert. Danielle is beautiful and Matthew immediately falls in love with her. Shortly after identifying her, he sees her undress from her window and can not help but look. Danielle surprises him to look at her and gets angry at first, but soon it seems that it has fallen for him too. Danielle is a former pornstar, whom Matthew does not discover until her friend Eli (played by Chris Marquette) shows him a video with her in it. To further complicate matters, Danielle Kelly's former producer / ex-boyfriend (played by Timothy Olyphant) shows up one day and wants Danielle to go back to adult movies. Kelly and Matthew get along at the beginning, but this changes when Matthew tries to convince Danielle to leave the porn industry, which Kelly does not like. Eli and Kelly are two characters that really steal the show in this film. Eli is Matthew's high school nerd friend who is always horny and obsessed with hot sex and women. He had some of the funniest lines in the whole movie. Kelly (the director of the porn with whom she worked with Danielle and who was dating her) is the fresh and wise guy who broke into every scene he was in. I could not decide whether to love him or hate him - he's a nice and funny guy when he and Matthew are friends, but when Matthew makes him angry he becomes psychopathic and violent. I do not want to give too much in this film, but Danielle has Matthew do things she never imagined doing. It is indeed a case of opposites that attract: Matthew falls for the adventurous and wild part of Danielle, and Danielle falls in love with Matthew's innocence and purity. In several scenes, you can tell in depth that Danielle is really a good person, she does not really want to be in the porn world, and she really cares about Matthew. Matthew feels the same way about Danielle and puts himself in many risky situations for her. This film was so moving that I cried in a couple of parts, and I do not cry easily. Yet there were also some fun parts that I could not stop laughing (especially the scenes with Eli and Kelly.) Definitely worth watching and underestimating.""",1
b'I do not understand why the other countries have all 4 seasons available and the United States does not. This is a great show and should be available here. I have most of the shows recorded via TV but I would like to have a box set of this show.',0
"b'This is still one of my favorite programs to date. I really like to review the episodes again and again. This is the penultimate season and is one of the best seasons. Obviously over the years, children are growing and maturing and this leads to interesting situations. In the Fast Friends episode, Steph goes out with the kids who smoke and make her feel pressured to do the same. I also like the apartment where Steve buys an apartment and DJ sleeps on the couch. Danny finds her (after returning home late) and gets very angry. Full House is a great show that I\'m sure the kids of today would still like, and even the biggest ""children"" like me are still nice because I grew up watching it. There has never been a cooler (or nicer) uncle than Uncle Jesse, and the love between the whole family is fantastic and fun to watch. This is one of the best seasons and every fan should definitely have this in his collection.'",1
"b""You would think that Hollywood would not have a problem shooting a movie about Hollywood. Think again. It's true, there were some beautiful photos in which Hollywood looks at itself. The oldest that comes to mind is A Star is Born of 1937, which was redone as an even better film in 1954. The Sunset Boulevard of the '50s is one of the biggest films ever made, and a few years later Singin arrived 'in the Rain, a classic musical. Yet over the years, the industry has produced more bad films about themselves than good. American Sweethearts can be found somewhere in the middle. Its beginning is quite promising, but it falters and goes downhill afterwards. Lee [Billy Crystal] is a Hollywood news agent with big problems. His boss, Dave [Stanley Tucci], needs him to promote the new move with Gwen Harrison and Eddie Thomas [Catherine Zeta-Jones and John Cusack]. The couple was the hottest and most popular married couple in America, and the audience crowded to see their films. Now that I'm about to get divorced and can not stand the sight of each other, I'm a boxoff poison. Lee must find a way to convince the press that Gwen and Eddie are coming back together without letting the two stars know what they're doing. He enlists the help of Gwen's sister, Kiki [Julia Roberts], who not only takes offense at the way Gwen orders her, but is also secretly in love with Eddie. Then there is the problem of the film itself. All that the study has seen are the opening credits. The director [Christopher Walken] does not want to show it until he has made some changes. These changes will produce a very different film from what the study paid 86 million dollars. Reading the synopsis above, he shows me how fond and insinuating the lovers of America might have been. The plot leaves ample space for farce and satire, but the writers do not take advantage of it. Instead of being brilliant, fragile and perspicacious, the story is pretty, cloying and docile. Most Hollywood chances of laughing at herself are wasted. So it's Julia Roberts. Although I have finally come to respect her, I do not think you are right in a simple Jane role. Also, he did the ugly duckling in a swan routine too many times before. The film is primarily a project of vanity for Billy Crystal, who also produced it, and for director Joe Roth, who used it to launch his new company, Revolution Studios. They were probably afraid of upsetting the Hollywood establishment, of which they belong, too. If your mind wanders while watching a movie, it usually means it's not grabbing you. There are several scenes in American Sweethearts in which a character says something and everyone in the room gasps. I started thinking about it. In all my life, I've never met anyone who has ever said anything that has made all listeners start, and I've met very nice people. This is something that only happens in movies. Then, I started to list in my head other things that you only see on celluloid. Before I knew it, the film was over.""",0
"b""The hostel has collected much controversy at the time of release and has generated a series of generally nauseated public reactions. Many responded with hatred towards the violent and unshakeable nature of the film. My problem is not in violence. I can not connect to the first half of the film, which mainly concerns the normal insensitive male behavior while walking around central Europe. All this becomes a long wait to see what awaits in the second half, and provides very little accumulation to what we will eventually endure. All the violence in the film is harsh, personal and disturbing. It's not funny, but in a broader sense, rather interesting. It reminds you of the world, and what dark places can exist where anything or anyone can be bought for the right price. This DVD contains some beautiful featurette, and overall a great set of extras, including a featurette that is almost entirely about the inspiration and reaction to the film, and how much of it is based in reality. Eli Roth is certainly an intelligent man, and he's out to tell a message, not just for the shock, but because of the harsh and raw nature of the film, it's hard to digest, and it's all too uncomfortable to be really memorable. Maybe there's a little too much truth in the Hostel.""",0
"b'TETSUJIN 28 is a Japanese live action film based on the manga series by Mitsuteru Yokoyama, best known in the West for its animated black and white adaptation of 1963, broadcast by US television in 1966 under the title ""Gigantor"". ""There are some pretty spectacular scenes here of two giant robots, Tetsujin 28 and Black Ox, who trudge through the streets of Tokyo and affect its skyline, including a heart-rending move where Black Ox leans back on top of Tokyo Tower. \'It\'s also quite a while where the black Ox throws the disabled Tetsujin into the Parliament Building - these sequences are pretty exciting and well done, as if the cameras were on the scene and captured the action while it was unfolding. , the two successive battles with robots do not deliver the goods.The fists pitched are rather weak and there is not much movement in the fighting.The robots never fly and fight in the air, even if, from the final meeting, they both really that power.The original animated series had a giant robot action far more satisfying than what we get here.Even worse, the guy, Shotaro, who was designed to operate the remote device that with Tetsujin trolls, never really seems to want to do it. He is weak and scared for most of the film. When he finally gets close to the plate and accepts his role at 90 minutes - too long for us to have to wait - it is not particularly effective. While the guy who plays Shotaro could offer a realistic representation of how a real ten-year-old would react according to circumstances, I must confess that I was not exactly looking for realism. I wanted the boy to be gorged to the hilt and eager to control that mighty robot and send him in furious combat to put an end to the Black Ox\'s depredations. Just like Shotaro (or ""Jimmy Sparks"" as he was known in ""Gigantor"") it involved in manga and original souls. Or the heroes of the boys in ""Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot"" and in the Gamera films of the 60s. These new Japanese heroes are really crazy when they are tested (see also Toru in GAMERA THE BRAVE and Tadashi in THE GREAT YOKAI WAR, two films also made in 2005 and both reviewed on this site). What does this say about the next generation of Japanese heroes? At least Ash from ""Pok & eacute; mon"" still knows what to do when faced with a threat. However, I liked one aspect of the film. I loved seeing two idols of Japanese pop music in the cast. The oldest is Hiroko Yakushimaru who was popular in the 80s and acted in a film I remember called SAILOR SUIT AND MACHINE GUN (1981). She plays Shotaro\'s mother and she is quite beautiful. The other is one of my favorite J-pop singers of all time, Yuko Nakazawa, one of the founding members of Morning Musume, here to play a young police detective assigned to the case. They give her short dark hair and a rather simple blue dress, clearly an attempt to belittle her usual charm, but she has a lot to do and is always a shiver to see her in action. Another key female character is Mami Tachibana (played by Yu Aoi), an MIT robotic expert recruited to help restructure Tetsujin 28 after a disastrous battle in the beginning. She is young and gritty and looks graceful in uniform and cap while making friends with the young Shotaro. The soundtrack of Akira Senju is beautiful and melodic and keeps things cheerful when the film slows down (which it frequently does). Actually I also have the soundtrack CD. The final music is repeated in a replay of the male choir that sings the ""Tetsujin 28"" of 1963, accompanied by the shots of the original manga, which seems much richer in action than anything in this film. The Pioneer / Geneon DVD does not offer credits of English anywhere, except for what is in the DVD case.'",0

The eight-year-old girl who saw her to the end (she always does, no matter what!) She was often distracted and her five-year-old brother was bored and left the room before the scary parties forced us to shut down the tape. 3) Attempts to make the story appealing to children by adding animal characters further confuse the plot and make the story not recognizable to anyone, like me, who has read and appreciated the book.

Often the results are poor video / audio quality (although the films themselves are quite good - ""Brideless Groom"" is one of the funniest comedies of Stooge ever).

"b""This was a very interesting film. In fact it is NOT forbidden in Singapore. I saw this movie while living there and it was a real relief. Although the film focuses on street fanatics, the general theme is the forgotten people of Singapore who are unable to be doctors, lawyers or government (government) cronies. Students are rationalized at a very young age and some negative tests mean that you are massed with scum. This film shows what is happening in Singapore on one side of which many synagogues are not aware. 5 stars for audacity. The cinematography is hard (move) in some parts and the plot jumps a bit ... but it's still very compelling.""",1
"b'If you liked the first one, this is your alley. I say that mainly because the tone (darker than many mainstream films), occult nature and unusual images have a tendency to put out some viewers. But if you simply want to watch a movie about a demon that has been raised by humans to fight evil, this is a great movie for you. The style of directing by Girillermo del Toro is very kinetic and flowing. This helps to keep the rhythm of the film, preventing it from being dragged. The scenes flow very well from one to another (which is also very well done with some creative wipes and overlays). The real draw for this film, however, is Hellboy and the team that was provided. Ron Perlman is the absolutely perfect Hellboy. His delivery of the lines is, to say the least, perfect in creating an immature character, but in the end it is amiable (as well as loving). He has an ironic humor about him that makes the Hellboy character something we can all relate to. We\'ve all had moments when we feel valued below. We felt all the unwanted strangers. Yet despite all the incentives he has to renounce to defend these humans, he continues to do so because he is what his ""father"" has taught him to do. Of course, Abe and Liz are here too, and Doug Jones and Selma Blair do a wonderful job in portraying their respective characters. But this is not their movie. It is interesting, however, to see one of the elements of the plot of the first film turn around to portray the other side of it in this when the team meets the angel of death. In short, as I said above, if you liked the first one, this is just your type of movie. I can not wait to see what Toro thinks about the third film. (Of course, we\'ll have to wait for it to finish `` The Hobbit \'\'.)'",1
"b'Former government agent Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) has to solve the mystery behind the events that happened when he was a child to save the planet from being destroyed by monsters of another dimension. OK, I admit, ""Alone in the Dark"" \'\' is not one of my best films of all time, but it\'s not even in my worst movie list. It could be directed by Uwe Boll, who is considered by many to be the worst director of all time, but if all the other Boll movies are like that, then Boll was grossly underestimated, because I have seen many films that are much worse than this (for example, the remake ""The Stepford Wives""). The script is based on a video game, which gives it that ""videogame"", moving from one level to another, you feel that you with many films of this type (such as ""Resident Evil"" or ""Doom""), but this does not he removed the film as it makes me want to go out and play. Not being a player, this was my first encounter with ""Alone in the Dark"", and I found the story interesting enough to keep my interest in the length of the film. Acting is of uneven quality. Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff (as another government agent) both turn into decent performances, but Tara Reid is so unconvincing as a scientist who actually adds to the film\'s entertainment value. My main criticism is that some battle scenes are too long. There is a fight scene about 1 hour which includes about 15 minutes of people shooting monsters with very small dialogues, which have become boring after a while. Despite this, I still liked the film and I would be ready to watch it again.'",0

The Stink was animated in a way that complimented perfectly the illustrations in the book, and Conan\'s companion Andy Richter does a fantastic job giving voice to the ""all-attitude, all the time"" garbage truck. The animated version of I Stink is almost a huge success with my son like the book. The DVD also includes some other animated adaptations that (sort of) carry on the theme of the garbage truck. Trashy Town is the only other trash-themed story of the DVD, but with its simple animation and its catchy ""chorus"" went very well. The others are inconsistent. Arnie the Donut was funny and a little disturbing (he talks about a sentient pastry aware of his imminent departure), but The Beast of Monsieur Racine was just a little strange.

"b'While for me ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" remains the most beautiful series of Masterpiece Theater of all time, this follows closely. Gemma Jones is superb as Louisa Trotter, the Cockney Cook / Hotelienne who never loses her smooth common sense or her heavy cockney accent even after becoming the hostess of the rich and famous of Edwardian England. The previous episodes focus on the growth of Louisa as assistant cook to lover of the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII). But most of the series is about the actions of the Bentinck Hotel, an exclusive private London locale run by Louisa. With a few exceptions, one\'s family must have been in Debrett\'s Peerage for at least 100 years before being able to book a room at the Bentinck. Still, Louisa\'s selectivity is not so much a reflection of snobbery on her part as of her passionate commitment to being The Best in whatever she does. The whole series is full of characters and incidents, and in fact Jones / Louisa is very much in the background in many of the episodes. But it is indisputably the dominant and dominant character in this series. You did not see the virtuous indignation without brakes until you saw Louisa, in the last episode of this collection, to testify in court on behalf of her friend, Lord Haslemere, who sparked a diatribe after the diatribe in all her glory cockney .

Chevy Chase is clearly in his element that takes the role of well intentioned stepmother, but irretrievably clamorous, Clark, which naturally exaggerates creating ""the perfect Christmas"". The talented Beverly D\'Angelo is also here as the supportive wife of Clark, who gets his buttons pushed by annoying relatives and whining and his sweet husband. The late John Hughes fills the screenplay of satire and references to the holidays, chased with the trademark ""Lampoon"" slapstick and lowbrow humor. Of course, sometimes the tanks of humor, but it is a more noble effort than the previous irregular ""European vacation"". This challenges you not to laugh out loud while the Griswolds\' efforts to ""make the best Christmas"" turn into a long train accident, which can tickle the fun bone of any ""Scrooge"". Look for familiar faces Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki (the latter currently in the hit sitcom ""The Big Bang Theory"") like the guys from Griswold; a pre-Seinfeld Julia Louise-Dreyfuss as half of the snobby snob neighbors suffering from Clark; and Doris Roberts, Diane Ladd and William Hickey as some of the annoying relatives who come to visit. But in reality it is Randy Quaid\'s retaliation of the quirky and quivering Eddie madman who steals every scene he is in. If you want a serious interpretation of a holiday classic, look at ""It\'s a wonderful life""; if you want to laugh loud and thick, then definitely watch this!'",1

"b'After reading the wonderful book ""Doc"" for the book club, my husband and I watched ""Tombstone"" a few days ago and ""Wyatt Earp"" last night, in preparation for the book club meeting next week. To all those who say that there is some controversy about which film is better, I can silence the controversy: ""Tombstone"" is better. Watching ""Wyatt Earp"" is like watching a scurrilous community theater (no offense for the community theater) from opening scenes with Wyatt (Kevin Costner, with his trademark anachronistic shag / hairdo) drinking a steamy cup of coffee like a witch\'s cauldron, as if the machinists put a piece of dry ice in the cup. Except for the beautiful Gene Hackman in the role of father Earp, the protagonist of the film \'acting is either silly comics, or melodramatic, or wooden, or incredibly, all three at the same time. Having just seen the portrait of Kurt Russell tightly controlled and super-masculine Wyatt Earp in ""Tombstone"", the character of Kevin Costner on the same character reminded me a bit \'of Forrest Gump, no offense to Forrest Gump, crossed with Costner Il character of ""Dances With Wolves"" (same hairstyle). I love Dennis Quaid, but I saw the definitive portrait of Doc Holliday in ""Tombstone"" by Val Kilmer just days before he saw the Quaid version in ""Wyatt Earp"" was probably completely unfair to Dennis Quaid and his beautiful sunglasses who had not even come close to me. I love westerns, but this bizarre film - a narrow bottle shot just before a bullet explodes, somebody? - made me roll my eyes. To sweeten the deal, it\'s more than three hours long! Recommendation: look instead at ""Tombstone"".'",0

WOW! I think the only people who should watch this documentary are those who do not like U2.

"b'Having played both `` BloodRayne \'\' games, I\'m a fan of the series. So when I heard that they were making a movie, I was a bit interested. But basically I knew it would probably be disgusting. I was more than right. Unless you\'re interested in such a terrible shit to make you laugh, DO NOT BUY THIS FILM! It\'s a total disaster! Movie Rayne does not look like his video game counterpart. The combat scenes were slow, not at all like the fluidity of the game. And do not get me started seriously ... I\'ve seen better configurations in a haunted house. Nothing has been done realistically, and the ten-minute summary at the end of the film (which was done for some reason I will never understand) shows just how sloppy it is. The acting was not great, and the short sex scene ... let me say that I found myself laughing for most of this mess. Needless the day, the plot was also missing (and this is putting it lightly). If you want a vampire movie, take the ""Underworld"" movies. If you are a fan of ""BloodRayne"" looking for something that matches your fandom, repeat the game.

"b'The Italian Job is the best film ever made, without a shadow of a doubt. Usually, I agree with Leonard Maltin, but sometimes it is out of scale and he is definitely in this case. Okay, you may feel that the characterization is poor, but they are meant to be stereotypes. This film was an ironic way before Kevin Williamson and his genre were born. It is worth noting that the United Kingdom censorship in 1968 would not allow the publication of any film that would make it appear that the crime paid so that the ending was tied to that one condition. If you only buy a video from Amazon (and this would not be nice - they have a wide range of high quality movies - could I personally recommend The Quiet Man, for example?) Make it this.'",1

Rapid movements, secondary plots intertwined in an orderly, brilliant, overall superb. I came out of the cinema after laughing at myself stupid and at the same time I enjoyed a plot that was simple to follow but complex in makeup. Guy Ritchie did a great job on this, the cast was chosen superbly, even Brad Pitt, who, until now, was not my favorite. Now I also bought the DVD, two discs, a series of extras, I looked at it four times, I can not watch it anymore, my ribs would not stand the blow they take. I recommend it to everybody.

This film is extremely glamorous and looks as if it were following the script of an ancient soap opera rather than the life of the last queen of ancient Egypt.

The acting of Billy Zane (Antony) and Timothy Dalton (Caesar) was very good, and Lenor Varella (Cleopatra) offers a good show, if you like exaggerated passion and drama. If you want to see a fictional television viewing of Cleopatra's life, this is your movie, but Cleopatra's film with Elizabeth Taylor is far superior.""",0

"b'In short: style on substance. There are some excellent sequences, but that\'s all what seems to be a movie, well-planned sequences and performed - but with nothing coherent that unites the whole thing together. The ""airplane near the stop and the last-minute rescue"" is extremely impressive and the machine-gun ammunition slamming on Supe\'s chest, followed by the bullet in her eyes, is magnificent. My jaw was falling and I almost wanted to cheer. Here\'s what Superman talks about: seeing him defeating the bad guys in new, engaging, even fun ways. But that was where the fun ended. Like what Superman does not speak about are the children of love and the ridiculous heroic blast with kryptonite. I find that both are so horribly far-fetched that they both need to be ridiculed. As Brodie (cleverly played by Jason Lee in Kevin Smith\'s Mallrats) points out, ""It\'s impossible, Lois Lane could never have Superman\'s baby, do you think his fallopian tubes can handle his sperm? during sex, he probably blows a load like a shotgun shot ... right behind his back. \'\' So, apart from the fact that Lois Lane is alive in post coitus, you would then have the impossibility for a human being to conceive and complete a child of an alien Do not forget that just because Clark Kent appears and behaves like a human being, he is an alien, he is a completely different species, and completely different species can not mate. think of the massacre that would cause in the animal kingdom if a lion falls in love and mates with a crocodile or a guinea fowl The other problem that makes me shiver with rage is the whole idiot concept of Superman that is physically able to lift an entire continent of kryptonite into space. As Internet blogger dpogue21 so prophetically expresses it (much better than I could - so thanks dpogue) in his review of imdb, ""My next complaint is that Superman raises a continent made of kryptonite in space. of the Simpsons to point out what\'s wrong with this.I do not know how many comic books he has read Bryan Singer, but when Superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite, he just has the strength to stay upright. \'idea to fly him a big island made from his greatest weakness in space, no longer has any commercial relationship with other projects related to Superman.The concept is as ridiculous as making a Dracula film in which the protagonist has a stake in the heart and still manages to pilot a spaceship made of garlic in the sun Why not just have Superman eaten kryptonite? Can you eat it and then brush your teeth with it, and then an give to sleep in kryptonite pajamas. It is no longer absurd that he has hoisted a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall helplessly through the atmosphere without burning back or splashing across the central park when it hits the ground. \'\' Do I have to say more? I do not think so. ** [...]'",0
"b""The special effects were fine, but the story was weak, silly and predictable. As a child, I love Alien's films.

So, with that, I was thrilled to see this film and relive some of the memories. What a disappointment. It was not scary at all. The people in the theater were actually *** SLEEP ***. I was jealous of them. Mostly I was glad it was a short film. Unfortunately, the scariest thing about this movie was a penguin. Do not see it.

"b""Peter Brooks' spartan adaptation of William Golding's immortal novel about a group of British schoolboys stranded on a dessert island still runs nearly four decades after its initial release. Despite the total lack of names of stars and limited production values, the film succeeds thanks to the performances of the minor actors and to a general primitivism that makes everything imminent credible. At first the survivors do not seem to have it so badly; there are plenty of food, no adults and no predators ... except maybe one, a & quot; beast & quot; it could be a strange animal or a ghost or something much worse ... A moving and ever-touching accusation of intrinsic human ferocity, the Lord of the flies manages to translate the essence of Golding's story on the screen. Like many adults, children think they are good enough to do their utopia. So much for utopia. So much for the innocence of childhood.""",1

"b'Poor Bellini! Out of fashion for a century and saved from almost obscurity by the genius of Maria Callas just to be trashed by this horror. What must we do about the absurd production of Zimmerman? Bellini in a kind of loft for offices in a big city, the characters, the action in total contrast with the romantic soundtrack of the bel canto, the opera reduced to almost farce. He may have been saved from a superior song, but that too is missing. It is almost as if the singers were asking themselves: ""What the hell is this absurdity and why we are here!"" Every lyric performance should be a tribute to the composer, but in this case it is nothing but a tribute to the director and his obvious need to be seen as something absurd, outrageous and inventive. One can only shudder in thinking about what\'s in store for future operatic performances (if any). Can we wait impatiently for his Norma set in Detroit, a metaphor for the collapse of the city?

And they discuss the key issues in the minds of all the fans: the reasons for the break and the possibility of new music. In fact, the best part of this film (apart from the music) is the impromptu interviews of Kelly fans. She starts asking questions! What a concept! This is an opportunity so wasted. The directors were either inept, or too starry and ""honored to be chosen"" to make a film with depth. We left with a lazy and volitive love letter. Tiptoe filmmaking.Look, I love all things Pixies.

"b'From the trailer and the presence of Julia Roberts in the cast, I joined CLOSER expecting a light romantic comedy. (My preconceptions have not been so upset since I saw Bambi\'s mother get shot by Saturday morning hunters!) CLOSER opens up while Alice (Natalie Portman), a stripper in New York visiting London, is touched by a car after it has been viewed on the left instead of on the right coming down from the sidewalk. She is taken to the hospital by a stranger, Dan (Jude Law), an aspiring writer with whom he begins a live-in relationship. So, Dan sits down for a formal portrait of the photographer Anna (Julia Roberts), on which she struck without success. Subsequently, Larry (Clive Owen), a dermatologist, meets Anna, who gets married, then divorces after discovering that she has had recent sexual relations with Dan, once despised. With the rebound and the need for physical comfort, Larry looks for Alice, who is now stripped of clothes in a strip club in London after leaving Dan, and who she has already met in one of Anna\'s photo exhibitions. But Dan continues to worry about Alice and is emotionally upset that she has had sex with Larry. Is it so messed up or what? (The timeline is murky, apparently all this happens within a couple of years.) CLOSER is a painful film to watch, of the sexual manipulation, of the possession and obsession in which the four main characters inflict the to another emotional cruelty. It is not a holiday for an afternoon at the cinema with your elderly mother. The language is sexually graphic and, in a sequence of scenes in the London strip, visually vulgar. CLOSER is, however, one of the best films of 2004. Julia Roberts is perhaps the biggest surprise as it shows she can radically transcend - even beyond ERIN BROCKOVICH (2000) - her usual cute roles; I was very impressed. It would be difficult to choose the main role and the supporting parts. All four (Portman, Law, Roberts, Owen) have about the same time on the screen (although I was not keeping an eye on the stopwatch). Everyone, or everyone, could get an Oscar nomination. I had started to doze for about a quarter of the film, but then I woke up almost with a start when I realized that CLOSER is an exceptional adult film, without visually explicit sex or violence, which brutally shows adults in dysfunctional relationships that behave in worst way. Really, as indicated by a joke in KINSEY: ""Sex is a dangerous game, if you\'re not careful, it can open you wide.""'",1
"b'WHAT IS THE HOLLYWOOD PROBLEM, HOWEVER? THIS IS THE BIGGEST FILM EVER MADE. Ok, maybe I do not honestly believe it. Perhaps ""The Cable Guy"" is a bit better. Ok, maybe it\'s a problem. I can not decide Oh, hell, it does not matter! I think what I\'m experiencing is that I\'m damn tired of listening to people in this movie. I am so fed up with it, in fact, that I will lie openly in the teeth to those who do not like them and I will tell them that it is my favorite movie, even if it is not really. It is not my favorite film of Arnold for a long time, but I still classify it in the top ten. It\'s not even a tenth as bad as they say. There were avid Schwarzenegger fans who actually came to hate Arnold after making this film. Why, I ask? BECAUSE ? QUESTION TO KNOW! Is it acting? Is this the script? Is it the story and the premise? Special effects, car chases, what? Ok, acting is trivial. I give you this. The story is far-fetched and the action is exaggerated. I\'ll give you that too. But guess what, stupid sheriffs? IT IS SUPPORTED TO BE SO! This film was intended as a social commentary. It is satire. He was destined to make fun of films by example. It indicates the most intrinsic defect in the whole cinema. Fantasy! Quite right ! Exposes the film industry for what it is. That is, a circus, a mad house, a rabid dog, a wild beast, a monolithic volcano of glamor, fiction, vanity, and and ... And just ... strident shrill ... FRAUDS. Okay, so it is. I just answered my question. The reason Hollywood hates such outrage at this film is simply because it does not like being the subject of debates such as morality and ethics. However, it is not a great secret that Hollywood is full of fake, satanist, (...) and devil worshipers. The world knew it years ago. It does not seem to hurt the grosses, though, does it? People keep watching movies. They keep watching television. They continue to adapt to the political media circus that is the Oscar. Strange Holly is clearly going well. So, why did this movie scare them like that? Do not ask me. I can tell you that Arnold Schwarzeneger had to have a lot of balls to be in a movie like this. Especially when he was still a newcomer to the profession of actor and to America. But hey, it\'s just an action movie, and it has a good storyline. However, it seems that there is no end to the contempt that directors and critics have for Arnold. That\'s not what pisses me off any more, anyway. What pisses me off the most is that movie audiences might be so naive and stupid to accept anything Hollywood tells them about a certain movie. Not critical, mind you. Nobody pays more attention to criticism. Above all the rich fools with their thick thick books and their thick big mustaches. No, I\'m talking about the entertainment industry, in general. Usually if every actor, every director, every producer and every talk show staged a personality on a certain individual, or a certain film and shouts at the top of their collective lungs ""THIS WORK OF THIS PERSON IS TERRIBLE. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM , ""everybody believes them, what these people should scream is"" WE ARE FEAR. WE ARE JELLY. WE WANT TO SEE THIS PERSON FAIL \'\' This is all the entertainment. It is an artist who will stab another in the back. It is no longer a matter of teamwork. Usually if enough people in the profession denounce the work of a certain person, the rest of the world will think ""Well, damn it! Everyone in Hollywood thinks this film sucks.It must be true, well I\'m not going to waste the My money \'\' That\'s why this bombed movie, not because of its quality or lack of it, but because of the amount, that is, the amount of people in the business who said it was not good, and the so-called fans, just like the gruesome group of emotional troglodytes and dragons that are, have fallen for this.They stayed away from the film en masse.And what do you think happened? Well, the film is flopped, of course.It\'s the boldest artistic genius attempt by Arnold Scwarzenegger. and nobody went to see the most beautiful thing ... Well, let me tell you something ... I saw the movie and I appreciated it and I\'m not alone, but I\'m tired of feeling like a doofus every time I defend this film. I am st also some people who laugh at me when I tell them I\'m a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger, or a fan of Jim Carrey, or a fan of Norm Macdonald, or a fan of Stephen King. I\'m fed up with it, and I will not defend it. If someone here needs to be ashamed, it\'s YOU THEN! I do not care what someone says. So, you can kiss me all for $ $ and go to hell. I love this film, and I will kill EVERYTHING WH WHO TRY TO CHANGE MY MIND. That said, buy this DVD. It is certainly quite cheap (unfortunately for Arnold).'",1

"b""Starting in the late 50s, there was a series of country music films made, perhaps in reaction to the hit series of rock and roll B films of the same period. Most of them contained a sort of plot that involved the rubbing of all kinds of problems. But these films were not just the exaggerated exaggeration of hilarious hillbillies; they were the weird anthem of hilarious hillbillies that had the famous country music stars as friends. In other words, the fragile textures and faded movie stars were just an excuse to show a slew of country music stars of the era. Many of the performances were synchronized with the lips, although some were recorded live. The Nashville Sound, recorded in 1969, was different. Perhaps influenced by the documentaries Pennebaker of the time, this film did not have an inconsistent plot or trivial gags. Instead, it was a serious look at Nashville and the stars of the country in charge of the day. It is well shot, accurate and fascinating to watch. Much of the film was shot at the Grand Ole Opry, but you also have priceless films like Loretta Lynn performing for a lunch of radio and people from the record company, Bashful Brother Oswald singing a chorus of Mountain Dew outside the store Ernest Tubb records, a test of the new mother Earth (with Tracy Nelson), a performance outside Shelby Singleton's home, a recording session with Doug Kershaw and a young man, without a beard, Charlie Daniels, and much more. There's also a lot of great Nashville movies themselves. All performances are exceptional and the film does a great job capturing the essence of country music of the era - artists, fans and insiders. I was waiting a long time before it came out on DVD!""",1
"b'The last Samurai is a very good film that is not up to par. It should not take away the fact that it is one of the ten best films of the year or that contains one of the best performances of the form of Ken Watanbe, whose portrait of a loyal Samurai leader is astonishing as he draws you into his world and his culture. You can understand why Tom Cruise follows him in his ways. This film is directed very well by the undervalued Edward Zwick and Tom Cruise offers an excellent performance. The only problem I have with this film is how important it is to you. Even films of this magnitude should not tug so hard on the epic strings. We understood that this is a great historical epic. There is no need to continue to insinuate it. However, this film is still worthy of some awards and a good audience.'",1
"b'This DVD is not what you would expect. It looks like something made by someone in their basement. It only has clips from 6 interviews and has no songs etc. Here.

"b""Action films remind me of the true beauty of films, the way a story can be told through visual arrangement and movement through framing, instead of dead dialogue and two motionless actors conversing. Those movies are like movies, while others draw from their silent black & amp; white roots, telling stories without words. Road Warrior contains one of the best examples of this - such a small moment, a minor obstacle overcome, and yet that boldly dances on the screen like a painter. Here's the magic, shot by shot. Halfway through the final chase sequence, a red hotrod comes up behind Max's big truck with the intention of killing him. In a shot that has been copied many times, Max emerges from the booth and pushes his rifle into the camera - forced perspective, moving left and right, back and forth in a zig-zag on the screen. The head of a bad man explodes like a firecracker, and we are treated by a cry of joy from the wild wolf of Max - an animalistic reaction to the ironically violence given by a child raised by animals. Now we have a series of leaps and bounds that tell the little story of the red car that loses control and hits other vehicles of the bad guys. That little story is closed by the famous and almost peaceful stroke of a man who turns upside down in a horizontal fall, always in a forced perspective that flies to the camera. Now another series of jumps jump as we jump back to the red track and struggle to stay out of the huge wheels of Max. In a beautiful game of movement, the car dances in front of Max's truck, darting back and forth in front of Max and to our screens like a dangling carrot, until we have a third masterful shot in a forced perspective: the camera approaches the grid of the truck, then rises and rises in the cabin to Max, when Max finally ends the suffering of this car nailing it in an explosion of gasoline and pieces of metal. A sick and twisted beauty ... Did you know that George Miller, the director of Road Warrior, also directed Babe?""",1
"b'The Ruff Ryders have become street legends in many ways in the Hip Hop culture and have set a standard for quality in delivering a product that is often rough and unpleasant in hardcore levels. This documentary about it is a small exception. The quality of the tape was - Gyarrbage. The main man in question-Wink 1100 is an expert ryder no doubt, but not much is shown regarding tricks on this tape other than wheeleez, wheeleez, and yes more wheelez with some ryders sitting on the handlebars, stopping the bikes with the nose up, and yes -more wheeleez. All this for the glory of saying you can go for BLOCKS with wheelee in your mind. Wink\'s commentary and the few cartoon-designed characters he created for himself are fun but short. They are fun in a bizarre and too long way. There are many scenes with repeated shots. It\'s only an hour, but by the time you look at your flying penny - you\'re done - finished - and in the words of Wink - you feel like ""Gyarbage"" for buying this ribbon. My recommendation would be to wait for Biker Boyz to go out on DVD and just keep going beyond the scenes in that movie where the main character and his crew are doing tricks to the STUNT Doubles. There is nothing similar in this RR project and with all the clamor that they put on their feet, it should be there. Maybe the RR guys should stop smoking green and sip that oil so they can focus on something more than just the wheel! -Seriously -RR has the flyest logo and support team with music, clothing and movies to boot, so offer more and invest in some quality editing and cameraman.

"b""I took this film on a whim, partly because I'm tired of seeing Americans turn into fat lumps or pussies frightened by their own shadow (or worse, virtuous idiots who really think the government is the answer to everything. Eastwood could hate the comparison, but this is a collage that goes far beyond The Karate Kid meets Secondhand Lions (New Line Platinum Series) .That's definitely right there with Million Dollar Baby (Full Screen Edition) and Absolute Power. It's hard to summarize this film, so I'll just say three things: 1. Weave every possible image of a self-taught American man in the most elegant way possible 2. Do for the mountain people of Viet-Nam what Bride and Prejudice did for India but without music, love and the dance.3 The finale is spectacular - the voice of Eastwood in the background, the slow song against a visual while the Gran Torino leads to the future with his special passenger who has inherited from the master, only for that I'm renting or buying the DVD.""",1
"b""first let's say this is a great video. I like watching it every time I want to go out and try something new. it also made me want to discover parkour generations as an organization. the more I look the more interested in becoming. The film is basically a documentary of the members of this group and some of their training sessions in different places. it's well done and I love music. there is a lot of content on the DVD so there will be a lot of things to take. there are many good ideas on how to train and unorthodox training that teachers take to the students. therefore, for this aspect, one could not ask for more. The only complaint I would like is that it is not a step-by-step presentation on training. there is no progress from this ability to the next. I really thought I was buying something more like it. so in that sense, I was a little disappointed. there is a video produced by American parkour that is specifically for the introduction to parkour training. I'll probably take one too. But this is really nice because it seems to me that there is a connection with the roots of parkour in France and it helps me to have a better overall feel for art.""",1

"b'I too love the original version for the cinema and I bought the 2-disc version from a while ago. I generally have an aversion to the marketing strategies of Hollywood, but from what I heard Mark Steven Johnson in his commentary on the previous version, they were really crunched in time during production, especially with some of the CG stuff. They also fought a lot with the MPAA to keep their PG-13 score. (It\'s hard to be true to the obscurity of the comic book series, while you market it to get the most optimal earnings.) We hope they took the time to sensibly incorporate extra shots of combat in the story and brush up some of the painful CG shots. (among many good ones). Apart from marketing commitments, I think that in these days there is greater pressure for directors to ""bring the product out of the door"" that have to make various artistic compromises (the LOTR). I really hope this DVD was made for Johnson to ""complete his original vision"" for an already good movie!'",1
"b'Once I saw that the DVD was made by Paramount Pictures, I had high expectations on the quality of this image transmitted to Blu-ray. I was not disappointed!

The wonderful video was so beautiful that I soon forgot about the 5.1 that I wanted to have. For those who both own a Blu-ray player and are fans of British military history, you will love this DVD.'",1
"b'& quot; The Breakfast Club "" it is the film of the pack that I imagine can be remembered for a long time as a watershed in American cinema, at least for the teenage comedy. The plot (for those not already familiar with it) revolves around 5 teenagers from various walks of life, forced to sit together through a Saturday afternoon detention session. A hilarious, well-done and often moving film about the fundamental truths that make us all human, John Hughes & quot; The Breakfast Club "" it is perhaps the only great exploration of the anguish and confusion that has tormented us all during the years of high school. The UNIVERSAL remastering efforts on this DVD provide a bit of angst. Despite having been improved in anamorphic way for the 16X9 displays, this new DVD offers nothing in terms of video enhancement compared to the previously released DVD. The colors are dated, unrealistic, often unbalanced with a little bleeding and smudging. Precise details are minimal, even in well-lit scenes. The levels of contrast, shadow and black are extremely weak. Age-related artifacts, including chipping, scratches and spice cuts are obvious. There is a considerable amount of film grain present for a completely unsatisfactory visual presentation. The audio, remixed to 5.1 in Dolby and DTS, features a dated feature with muted dialogues and virtually no spatial separation, except in music tracks. EXTRAS: A theatrical trailer that is badly worn. BOTTOM LINE: & quot; The Breakfast Club "" it\'s a brilliant movie. However, the lack of extras (a documentary would have been nice) and the really superficial handling of the transfer led me to say that this record is not really worth the money.'",0
"b""It only takes a few minutes to see how horrible this thing is. The film begins with some jets involved in a high-speed transcontinental competition. Well, our pilot hero Grant (Antonio Sabato Jr.) decides he needs to be refueled. Have you ever seen a team of vans refueling on the track during a NASCAR race? No ... not even me. It would be a bit dangerous, I guess. Well, Grant's jet is fueled by another plane while in the direct flight path of the other jet jets. What happens ? Duh ... there's a horrible collision and three pilots (along with 11 spectators ... eh?) They end up dead. Nice move guys. Perhaps the funniest and most pathetic event in the film happens a little later. Several years have passed since the tragic accident of the jet race and we are listening to a manager of the network who made a live broadcast of the race. The executive says ... are you ready? ... says that the film of the jets that clashed during the race was the most voted piece of footage they had shown in the last four years. Unbelievable! ! It speaks of a future world in which nothing exciting happens. It must be boring. Other things to look for are a guy who somehow emits a coughing sound while his mouth does not even move. Also, a scene in which bare-chested Jr. Saturday is about to wear a tank top. He takes it back but the camera changes angle and now you can not see it anywhere. Then the camera changes the corners again and he pulls it over his head. Excellent assembly! Everything is bargain basement in this film, except for the decent half-way acting. With a subtle texture of paper and terrible effects, however, I highly recommend that you do not waste your time watching this dreck. A final note ... without nudity and without graphic violence, I have no idea why this is classified R.""",0
"b'Bloodrayne (Uwe Boll, 2005) Sometimes you meet a really bad movie director, but every time he embarks on a project, he does something that, although you know, the film will be even worse than the last piece of ridiculous shit he released, make you want to see it. In this case, Uwe Boll, responsible for such execrable films as Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead, somehow managed to get his hands on a cast is hard enough to believe they were willing to bet on a Uwe Boll film based on video games. At the top of the list of ""what were they thinking?"" The actors here are Ben Kingsley. Can you believe this boy played Gandhi? Michael Madsen (Reservoir Dogs), Billy Zane (Posse), Michelle Rodriguez (Girlfight), Udo Kier (Suspiria), and a number of others arrive for the trip. I can not believe they were all tied to money. All are accused by the television actress Kristianna Loken (who last saw the big screen while playing the evil monster in Terminator 3), playing the lead role in the film, a half-human half-vampire who is ready to kill Kingsley The character of Kagan, because Kagan killed Rayne\'s mother. The fact that he is also his father does not seem to question his motivation. Not that anyone in this movie has enough of a character to really have a lot of motivation. This does not seem to worry Boll, who cuts this film exactly from the fabric of others: a lot of action, hints of sex that could actually be interesting if you care enough to explore those scenes, a useless screenplay, a photographic work that is just this part of competent, and the ability of Boll to make the worst acting worst possible by anyone staged. Yet despite all this, the most depressing thing about Bloodrayne is that the film actually did pretty well abroad (predictably, it flopped like a nightmare in America, making two and a half million, well less than a fifth of the budget) that Vivendi has highlighted Bloodrayne II. At least none of the original cast, including Loken, was tough enough to sign for what can not help but be another Boll monstrosity. (Zero)'",0
"b'We spend half our time on Lake Como, so I thought this DVD would be great. I wish the other reviews were available before buying the DVD. They hit many of the points - this is the best amateur raw video from a camcorder. It is completely incoherent, has no continuity and is embarrassing. Does Amazon not review personal DVDs before making them available?'",0
"b""So I was expecting a good time. Turner as the writer and Michelle R. in it ... However, I was strongly disappointed. I could care less if the prostitutes were used as part of the cast (hell, paid to not give a bad guy), I do not care that the plot was weak (I saw the films of Lamer), but the acting, or lack of that was amazing! ! ! While I was watching the comment (yes, I'm a monster watching them) all I could think of was that this movie would not have been bad if there had not been a sound. Hearing their voices was enough to make me shudder every time I listened. So if you are a greedy for punishment or just have to watch all the movies that get horrible reviews, then this is for you. Otherwise, jump and find Michelle in Lost Reper or Turner in L-Word.""",0
"b'This film almost reminds me of the TV sitcom Alice: set in a small restaurant out of the way, run by an irritable chef with a heart of gold, and composed of a trio of waiter, the exuberant Blondie Southern, the homosexual and naive, and the single mother (or the future mother), in this case, with the typical assortment of extravagant and colorful customers. The writer / director Adrienne Shelly still manages to take this model and do something wonderful. Far from being a simple remake of Alice, the Waitress is a well thought out and well executed exploration of a woman\'s struggle to get into her and fulfill her dreams, despite the bad choices and the wrong decisions she made along the way this weighs it down. What really sets this film apart from most of the other big screen movies is the screenplay. The dialogue, written by Adrienne Shelly - who also directed and co-stars like Dawn, the mousy waitress who eventually finds true love - shines with wit, charm and humor. It\'s fast and it\'s fun, but it always feels completely natural, due in no small part, of course, to the talent of the actors and actresses responsible for delivering it. Unlike the writing, for example, of Gilmore Girls, widely praised for its unique character, the dialogue in Waitress never seems forced or unnatural. It\'s brilliant without being intrusive. My only downsizing of this film is the fact that the message ""men are dogs"" is a bit heavy. Without exception, all male characters in Waitress are presented as middleweight, like Earl (Jeremy Sisto), without principles, like Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion), or simply banal, like Ogie (Eddie Jemison\'s). Even Joe (Andy Griffith), who turns out to be really kind and considerate, is shown during most of the film to be abrasive and demanding, to the point that Jenna Longanime is the only person who can take care of him and is really his only friend This is obviously a film made by a woman, mainly for a female audience, but you can not help but think that if a man made a film in which all the female characters were nothing more than gold scents, violent, sluts, there would be a serious, even if deserved, backlash. The Waitress is a good movie that is worth seeing. It is tragic that Shelly, brutally murdered in November 2006, will not make more films, as this film will undoubtedly bring awareness of the writer / director\'s impressive talent to a much wider audience than ever before. Fortunately, the Waitress is a memorial suitable to be remembered.'",1

And now this new remastered widescreen version, just released by Ignatius, has such a great quality and superior quality, along with many bonus additions, including the first availability of the French version (original) and the wonderful film and radio interviews with the wonderful Sydney Penny. Those interviews add so much to this film package. It\'s nice to see and listen to the beautiful Sydney Penny in person to talk about what it means to play this role.

Now we hope that many, many more people will listen to this lovely song and tribute to Bernadette from this fabulous Grammy-winning artist. He also has a second beauty sung by Jennifer Warnes on the CD, his song ""Prairie Melancholy"". Another musical gem of this heavenly singer.

"b'The cultural revolution that shook Paris from 1905 to 1930 is well documented in this fascinating two-hour DVD documentary, which includes photographs, film archives, literary extracts and analyzes. The focus on the arts, from classical and jazz to sculpture, from poetry to dance, from paintings to novels. The rise of modernism from postimpressionists to fauvism, to cubism, to dadaism and surrealism and to their many pioneers of art and literature is seen as an extraordinary period of free experimentation and interdisciplinary interactions, especially among poets and artists. Paris was the dish of fermentation and the avant-garde was strong, acute and multiple. Watching this documentary can cause envy. Or to have lived in a similar time! Certainly, me and many of my generation have actually experienced such a revolution, albeit short-lived in this accelerating society, when the San Francisco Bay area between 1965 and 1980 was the fulcrum of scientific, musical, artistic, noetic innovations. , ecological and other types and explorations. Which leads to a minor deficiency in the documentary: the absence of any mention of developments in science, particularly physics, and its influence on the arts, when the concepts of time, space and matter were subjects of radically new thinking. Otherwise, the survey is a wonderful cultural story, from the optimism of the pre-WWI and the engine of cynicism and creative critique that follows that carnage. The viewer can then plunge into the many books that cover this exciting period for further study. This DVD is an excellent introduction to art history and cultural studies.'",1
"b""We should all congratulate Uwe Boll. It's like some kind of cinematic cockroach. No matter how little talent he has, and no matter how ugly these films are, he manages to keep doing them. I know, he finances them all through a kind of bizarre German fund, but even so, his ability to continue making films despite complete and complete failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe. It would not be so bad if video game developers keep giving their best properties to this guy. I really liked the series of games Alone in the Dark. Even the last one, the New Nightmare, was good for a few hours of play. There was a good movie that had to be taken from the adventures of Edward Carnby, but that's not it. Now Uwe Boll has got his hands on Bloodrayne and Hunter: the Reckoning. What's next, Silent Hill? Fate? I can only imagine that this guy will cut the game-to-film adaptations if he's not stopped. Someone needs to take out his credit line, or these video game publishers have to know it and realize that when they make a bad movie from a game that kills the franchise, no one is more interested in that title. Think about it, House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark is a playable game title? There is no way . A new game House of the Dead comes out for XBox and nobody takes care of him. The title is dead, and all because of Uwe Boll. So if any of you out there work for a game publisher, or know a game publisher, or have access to a game publisher ... please let them know. This film itself is not even worth reviewing. I can not separate what I do not like about this pile of dung from the rest. Literally, everything about it sucks. Writing, acting, music, CG effects, editing. I thought if I waited until it came out on DVD and then rented it with low expectations, I would not be disappointed. Even the $ 5 you would spend on this DVD if you buy it used by one of the Amazon sellers is too much. You will regret it . This film is just a bunch of Boll.""",0
"b""Just for the money. He does not miss a beat. Creative writing and great shows. Humor and occasional drama come in subtle waves. The guy in this story is definitely the character of Hugh Grant and the merit of the story was presented a second boy, who is of age to be an authentic boy. He enters Grant's life and turns everything upside down and they both learn to be men. Instead of going to great comedy, the script is more subtle, focusing on the dilemmas, contradictions, hypocrisies of people and even humor in their tragic failures. It's really a drama that takes everything very seriously. But since it sees the light at the end of the tunnel, very clearly it teaches us that when life presents the end of something, it also offers a beginning to something else. Abbracciamolo!""",1
"b""There are many scenes in this film that really tell the truth about how the secretaries are treated in the American workplace.

Anyone who has ever wanted to go on but has been a victim of class snobbery and arrogance at work will refer to this film.

Still, he keeps his calm, even when he discovers that the couple who hired him is out to stab him (I mean this as a saying, of course ... or maybe? Aha ... I'll have to watch the movie to find out, right? ?). The great Japanese director, Akira Kurosawa, does a fantastic job in telling a compelling, bizarre, obscurely comic and very engaging story. The Japanese jazz soundtrack reflects the themes and tensions in the plot in a meaningful way, the casual room work is spontaneous and teases the audience, while the actors grimace, growl and chase each other with a vicious and (sometimes) inconsiderate abandonment.

"b'This musical delights us and still enchants us ... more than 40 years after it was made. Earn our old-fashioned applause - with a good solid song and dance entertainment. Robert Preston shines like Professor Harold Hill ... a ruthless scammer who proposes to deceive the entire population (about 2,400) of River City, Iowa. It enchants in their hearts (and in pocket books) and manages to stay one step ahead of the authorities. Along the way, he (Prof. Hill) touches the lives of a spinster (Shirley Jones in the role of Marian the Librarian) and his extremely shy little brother Winthrop (played by a very young and adorable Ronnie Howard) and, with his great surprise, it is found in the unknown territory of those who do good. His programmed escape is thus blocked, is captured and must, um, face the music. Apart from the way we are given some memorable and entertaining songs and some delicious dance choreographies. Film producers showed a bit of courage ... using a little imagination and taking chances ... and they gave us so much fun. My favorite points are the opening train sequence and the excellent dance scene (and song) inside the library. The citizens of River City are made to be stubborn and narrow-minded ... but in reality they are both producers of comedies. Virtually every adult character in the film distributes his share of the workload ... and adds humor to the overall enjoyment of the image. Paul Ford, like Mayor George Shinn, is particularly good ... and even Hermione Gingold, who plays his wife Eulalie, is funny (albeit in a different way). Shirley Jones is pretty good here. She has always been a great singer, but she also does some action and an effective footwork. Pert Kelton, like the Irish mother, is a delight. But the show practically belongs to Robert Preston. A very skilled entertainer, he is light on his feet and just as agile (and agile) as he manages his lines. He is not a great singer ... he speaks most of the lyrics of his songs ... but they (the songs) work, and they work well. I had heard it, in the pre-production phase of the film, they wanted to replace Robert Preston (the star of the theatrical version of ""The Music Man"") with someone else. Meredith Willson, the author of the original story, gave them an ultimatum ... or Robert Preston remains or ... no film. And, observing it (Preston) performing here, it\'s easy to understand that feeling. He is a pleasure.'",1
"b'This Is It shows that until the end the King of Pop possessed all the elements that made him a superstar. Here we see the preparation for his unfortunate London return, but even if we all know how this story ends you can not help but smile when you see Michael in his domestic element and have fun. The most intriguing part of this documentary is the lack of a true dialogue with Michael Jackson, but you can feel the gears that work actively inside it in its expressions; he was pouring every ounce of effort he could muster in this last effort to excite the world. This is Michael Jackson unlike what has been seen for years. Here he sings all his songs live, even the fast ones like Jam, They Do not Care About Us and Smooth Criminal - this element really shows to fans how it was really hard for him to put the crowd dancing and singing, and this movie makes it obvious the reason why Dangerous and History tours had to synchronize the lip with many faster numbers. Many MJ dance moves have been omitted and I wish we could have seen some of the test shots without the occasional distraction of the 3-D shorts (I would have put it on a split screen so that we could see that footage and the performance on stage at the same time). The bright performances of the test are certainly the following: they do not mind Uses Just Can not Stop Loving You There are ThereThriller (a totally new production compared to that used in the Dangerous and History tours!) Beat It (the first time in years that the I saw him dancing like that in 1982. The others are good too, but none of them is close They are crisp, or polished like those test numbers.The key point of this film about rehearsals is getting to hear him sing his hits live, and it would have been better if the album This Is It included those instead of the studio versions ... In addition, Michael\'s new female guitarist is fantastic (on the eyes and on the ears.) Many MJ dance moves are omitted, and I would like we could have seen some of the footage of the rehearsals without the occasional distraction of the 3-D shorts (I would have put them in a screen slot so I could see that footage and the performances at the same time). in all honesty, it\'s not at all a concert experience with MJ, but it has all the elements of one. The slogan of ""Getting to know the man you never met"" is not very accurate because there is very little of Michael Jackson\'s true dialogue outside of seeing him say ""God bless you"" to all members of the production team and notice when you think something should be changed in the way something is done. All of this is probably going to be remembered as the biggest concert ever happened in the history of music. From these few, vague fragments of what is the true concert This Is It we can see that Michael would have had a huge comeback through this series of concerts, and which again proved to be, and will always be the King of Pop. It is a memory that even though the tabloids tried to project it into a wicked light, Michael Jackson\'s message ONLY was a love. LOVE . clear and simple.'",1
"b""You all know the movie, one of the greatest of all time. This is a Blu-Ray review from the UK. First of all, it has no geographical areas, so it will play on US cars. Secondly, the image is absolutely WONDERFUL; crisp, clear and vibrant! Thirdly, the sound sounds good enough, but I do not have a sophisticated home entertainment system, so I can not give you much information there. This is a great transfer and it's like watching the movie for the first time!""",1

"b'I found this film very enjoyable. The plot is simple and, in some ways, rather insignificant - Camille, a well-known Parisian actress, returns from Rome to perform in front of her home audience in a show directed by her new lover Ugo. The comedy is Come Mi Mi Want by Pirandello, a classic opera (written for her lover Martha Abba) on a woman trapped between the yin and yang forces of reality and illusion. Throughout the film, Rivette changes his camera between the comedy and the ""reality"" of Camille and Ugo, almost wondering who the real Camille and Ugo are. What do they really want? What makes them reasonable? Can I, the spectator, enter their universe without plot? Rivette (and her excellent actors) show us that delicacy can be robust and inventive, that desire for another can never be realized and yet that fulfillment does not really matter, because in the process of struggle to achieve it we become alive and creative. . What matters is style; style is substance We are also treated to a brilliant description of the incestuous relationship between Italians and French and there is a delightful succession of nuances, hints and games with national stereotypes that made me smile. I can understand why some - those used for Hollywood clich\xc3\xa9s with their happy endings and plots oh so predictable - might not find the film so hot. Well, it\'s just a pity ...'",1

"b'Finally this film has been released on blu ray with the correct proportions! Tired of seeing it in 1080i and a timed cutout scheme of 1.78, I really should not use the word ""crop"" because it\'s Super 35, so they just opened the bottom of the frame so you can see it further down (always hated the fake letterbox). In any case this blu ray, like the DVD, shows the film in 2.35 format. Video is a small update to the clarity of wise DVDs, but not the Wow! factor that is expected from 1080p blu ray. The problem could be that Warner / New Line used a single layer disk (25 GB) and not the 50 GB upper disk. Why should they, when the only thing on this record is the movie and a theatrical trailer. I can not believe that Warner published this as they did. Do not pay the outrageous price that Amazon is asking for. I got my under $ 14 at the Best Buy. For this price, the update is valid. The soundtrack is still one of the best! All in all, even with secondary video update on DVD, it\'s still a good buy at an affordable price ... I just wish it was a better blu ray presentation.

"b""I do not know what to say to this movie casino. First of all, I've never played the videogame, but would probably win an acadamy award before this film. Which discredit probably to an excellent video game. Yes, it started out as it could be nice, so people tried to act. What can I say, Michael Madsen ... It seems you have never tried and are reading the cue papers. He does not fit this role. It just seems to keep the role of gangster in whatever film he has, without ever adapting his affection. Secondly, the dialogue was weak and the plot predictable. The love scene, which was the pact with that, as an economic ploy to drag young people to theaters, drop a porn scene in any movie and walla, you could get your money back by releasing them as an unclassified version. Just a horrible movie. I just hope that some Hollywood bigwig does not have the great idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8ba sequel, ouch, that just hurts to think about it.

The third attempt at observation lasted from a few days to 30 days and had no chance of getting to the film. The DVD version works well. After a small fight, Amazon made a unique exception and replaced it. Now, after receiving it and having decided to look at it again, I'm meeting the same thing. This time I am SOL. I have a top of the Sony BlueRay range and I have never had another problem, so I know it's not my player. Maybe they got a bad game from WB? Has anyone else got this problem too?""",0

"b""Toilet training is part of the parenting process and, although it usually starts in the childhood years, it may take longer with some children than others. Potty Power tries to speed up the process by presenting a DVD that encourages kids to use the potty and give up their diapers or pull-ups forever. He achieves this through his extensive speeches, songs, screenplay and optimistic attitude about using the potty. Jessica, the storyteller of Potty Power, is encouraging and extremely lively. He talks about peeing and pooping, slang terms for bodily functions and more, managing to keep a smile on his face. He really wants children to learn how to use the potty, and his enthusiasm, hopefully, will be passed on to children watching the DVD. This DVD certainly has its usefulness and I know many people who have been very successful showing this training session to their young children. But it becomes a bit 'trivial and many adults look up as they listen to the dialogue and the songs. Songs as I am proud to wear my underwear, Wipe Your Bottom and others are certainly catchy for the kids, but even some young people will find the material too silly to be true. One of my children has already been trained in the bathroom and laughs out loud when he watches this DVD, because of his silly and often banal style. Apart from that, the most important aspect is the effectiveness of the DVD and from my experience, Potty Power has made the difference. My younger one likes to repeat the lines that she has heard from this DVD and she likes to sing along with the songs. She is going alone, to the potty, so the DVD seems to have a positive effect, even if sometimes it becomes annoying. Potty Potty, despite its stupidity, is an effective means to wean off their diapers and pull-ups. If you can overcome the nonsense of the whole experience, the excessive perkiness of the narrator and the boring scene at the end, Potty Power seems to have something to do for it. The children will remember the motifs and the message, making this DVD a good complement for the training of the bathroom.""",1
"b'It\'s a great movie. Unfortunately, my four-hour vhs mode off air copy made about 30 years ago is a record higher than the DVD I\'ve just seen and which I assume is the current version, after buying it on January 15, 2010. There is no doubt that this DVD has been mastered by a VHS. How can I say? When the ""hi-fi"" audio tracks of a vhs tape move erroneously, it produces a very particular floating sound. This DVD is full of that kind of mistracking. Then there is the overlap at the reel change where about 45 seconds of the show are repeated, followed immediately by a break and an upcut that omits about 95% of a scene. For a commercial release this type of quality is completely unacceptable. There is a special place in the afterlife for ""the engineer"" who dominated this piece of shit. Here\'s a thought: forget the fancy menu and the so-called ""extras"" and try to give the customer a clean record of the program.'",0

"b'Manny Pontoriero\'s latest educational DVD set includes two DVDs that offer exceptional instruction in landscape photography. Like Manny\'s previous educational DVDs, do not just watch a DVD once. Instead, watch a DVD, take lots of photos and then watch the DVD again. Digital photography allows you to take many photos of a scene, from every angle, using different lenses and filters, with an immediate review of your efforts and without the need for development as in cinematographic photography. The first DVD includes multiple sessions with the Manny style instruction offering that includes drawings and examples of a topic. So, it\'s out in the field to use those principles in action. It is in the first DVD that Manny also explains Parallel Thinking. Parallel Thinking is ""how else can I photograph this scene""? Not just take the only picture you saw initially. Instead, what other options (different times of the day, different seasons, using different objectives, etc.) Can you use them to capture scenes in one place? The second DVD offers 14 field sessions at different points of the landscape along the east coast. In each session Manny offers a detailed description of what he is doing everywhere, along with why. In all these sessions there is little information you could lose, but they are important. For example, if you stack filters on a lens, use a stepped ring so you can use larger filters on a lens and do not create vignetting of the photo. Or, do not change lenses on the beach if the wind blows, because you do not want to get sand grains in the lens or in the camera; and, aspirate the lens and the camera when you are at home to remove the grains of sand on the outer surfaces. The second DVD contains a fifteenth bonus session in which Manny moves from the camera to the computer to briefly explain what changes he might make to a specific photo. Use the Photoshop raw editor to make these changes, along with the neutral density adjustment available from that editor. I highly recommend Manny\'s DVD sets, especially this set of two DVD landscape photography sets.'",1
"b""I do not know who I'm more sorry for, Stephen Dorff or Christian Slater. Dorff, who is a great actor even if you never know him in the movies he's in, has never been in any good since the original Blade was created in 1998. Slater's career has worsened over the years , practically taking part in some flop projects. Both actors sleepwalk through their roles in this latest videogame for the film adaptation of director Uwe Boll, the same guy who brought us another adaptation to the video game, the incredibly ugly House of the Dead. Alone in the Dark is not much better, with such a nonexistent story that you're scratching your head wondering what's going on before you pray for everyone to be killed. Even Tara Reid is on board as the smart girl and, as the previous reviewers have said, we know she is smart because she wears glasses. There's no saving factor on Alone in the Dark, and if you submit to the House of the Dead parody, then you know what to expect here.""",0
"b""The Last Unicorn could be my favorite movie to date and I was so happy to know that it was finally announced in the United States. Finally I would like to have The Last Unicorn a classic piece of animation in digital quality! However, I did not know that the production company would put all the 2 dollars into the DVD release of this important film. First of all it is only in Standard that it is right that the film has been cut from its original widescreen (which is the way the laserdisc was presented) to a format to adapt to the TV mode. It is most noticeable when the wagon of Mum luck passes and half of the words are cut off from the image. Secondly, digital transfer is TRUE! if I did not know, they copied the VHS master to DVD. the colors are all blah and the animation is lost. This confuses me because I also own the German widescreen version (which is incredible!) And their transfer is flawless and clear! third, has anyone forgotten the special features of this record? ! Play movie or scene selection. that's it! . Finally this film has the worst art of the box EVER! and it does not stop here the art is also on the disc and the interactive menus (which reproduce a terrible god made for the music of the DVD lifts!) This version of a fantastic movie is a crime! Artisan (the company) should really rethink and release a new special edition of the transfer. but it will never happen.""",0
"b""I went into this film trying to have an open mind, considering that I had felt, at best, conflicting things about it. But within the first 15 minutes, I knew it was a mistake to even give it a shot. It looks like a clunker right to the video, and it's basically what it is. the plot is simple. A man traveling on a lonely highway at night. There's a love triangle gone wrong and a lot of speculation about what's in the trunk, and why it's there. But I honestly did not care about anything. The acting is horrible and the writing is ridiculous. So, trust me ... do not worry about that either.""",0

Some people might be picky about death and carnage, but it's a fascinating slice of human drama. All the actors turn into wonderful shows, and I think this is one of Michael Caine's best. Also, John Barry's score is the best non-James Bond score he has made. All around a good Friday night or Saturday afternoon movie.""",1

It was as if they did not care enough about the central points that made the book work in the first place. I feel that the film has cheated me because the characters did not connect at all to the book! First of all, there is Agnes Bruckner, who played Vivian. In his book he did not look anything like ""Vivian"", his agenda and motivation were not the same, his personality was completely different from the book, his interpretation in the film was poor because Agnes was not in the character most of the time. The script was very old and terrible! My imagination wanted more drama and accuracy. The red-haired woman who played Esme ""underestimated the character (who was the most important hench-villaness in the book.) Everyone\'s acting in this movie was just too flat in general!

"b'This particular series of detectives stands above the string of whodunnits. There is only one other series of detectives in his class that comes to mind - and this is the series of Sherlock Holmes who starred in the wonderful Jeremy Brett. There\'s something terribly interesting about the relationship between Lynley and Havers. It is always strictly platonic and professional, yet it is something more ... a friendship. I refer fondly of Havers as a ""working spouse"" of Lynley. Those familiar with the series and newcomers will find that to some extent this is true. Friendship aside, there is a lot of hard work investigative in this series. I like the brainstorming sessions of Lynley and Havers and also their arguments, which can be pungent. I have to mention a word about the actor Sharon Small. It should be noted that Mrs. Small is so perfectly suited to the role of Havers, it is almost unbelievable. Overall, this is a series of high quality and very funny detective that only comes once in a while.'",1
"b'Former government agent Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) has to solve the mystery behind the events that happened when he was a child to save the planet from being destroyed by monsters of another dimension. OK, I admit, ""Alone in the Dark"" \'\' is not one of my best films of all time, but it\'s not even in my worst movie list. It could be directed by Uwe Boll, who is considered by many to be the worst director of all time, but if all the other Boll movies are like that, then Boll was grossly underestimated, because I have seen many films that are much worse than this (for example, the remake ""The Stepford Wives""). The script is based on a video game, which gives it that ""videogame"", moving from one level to another, you feel that you with many films of this type (such as ""Resident Evil"" or ""Doom""), but this does not he removed the film as it makes me want to go out and play. Not being a player, this was my first encounter with ""Alone in the Dark"", and I found the story interesting enough to keep my interest in the length of the film. Acting is of uneven quality. Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff (as another government agent) both turn into decent performances, but Tara Reid is so unconvincing as a scientist who actually adds to the film\'s entertainment value. My main criticism is that some battle scenes are too long. There is a fight scene about 1 hour which includes about 15 minutes of people shooting monsters with very small dialogues, which have become boring after a while. Despite this, I still liked the film and I would be ready to watch it again.'",0

"b'This is a masterpiece of a film by an inspired John Landis that takes a topic done dozens of times before - lycanthropy - and adds a little \'sauce and spices to the kettle. Here we have a film of werewolves with adventures, black comedies, some meat [both pressed together and torn to bloody shreds], laughs, ""oh-my-Gods"" and even pathos. This is a fantastic, imaginative, inventive film with superb special effects that you will never forget, as I have not seen since I saw it on the screen in \'81. Start with a couple of young Americans who throng it in the ghostly European countryside at night. I love the scene where they enter a pub and are welcomed like the plague. Both leave the place and are immediately struck by a werewolf with a boy who is dying to death and the other, the ""he-where is he gone"", David Naughton [who plays David] surviving only to become a killer werewolf . From that moment on everything is unleashed, as David falls in love during the day, kills at night and constantly clashes with his ""back-from-the-dead"" backpack companion, Jack - complete with hammered and torn flesh. Big laughs and laughter as with each of Jack\'s post mortem appearances that is increasingly deteriorated until, in the end, it is nothing but skull and band. The scene in the theater when Jack introduces David to each of his victims devoured, devoured, with gaping holes and missing limbs, is a beauty. The transformation scene in which David turns into a werewolf in his living room is absolutely EXTRAORDINARY and UNFORGETTABLE - this is a classic horror scene of all time. Greetings to special effects and make-up professionals here. GREAT film-making by John Landis with refreshing originality and a wonderful and cunning variation on a sterotypical horror theme. I\'m sorry that Naughton did not become the star he should have. If you have not seen this you MUST see before the next full moon. Lon Chaney Jr would have been proud of these guys.'",1

"b""We acquired this collection because we wanted to own the 1935 version of A Tale of Two Cities. We just saw it and it was a wonderful experience. The film is very close to the plot, the performances are superb. The book by Charles Dickens will forever be a testimony to the struggle between mankind and the other. Blanche Yurka's performance, like Madame DeFarge, is exceptional. The citizens of France, trying to put an end to the tyranny that live by the oppressive aristocracy, present the infinite example that when rights are trampled, it always ends in revolution and change. The Marquis St. Evremonde, played by Basil Rathbone, offers a vision of the horror that represents for anyone to show not to care for those who suffer. Especially when it comes to children; for the horror committed against this family, it triggers the fire that leads to events that put an end to the dominant society. The performance of Manette as an innocent man who was a prisoner at the Bastille for over 18 years is superb. His daughter, played by Elizabeth Allen, represents the person who inspires great love in two men, one Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton, played superbly by Ronald Colman. The character of Miss Pross, played by Edna May Oliver, is fantastic. We pass from his antipathy, to admiration and then to love her for her sacrifice that saves the life of Mrs. Manette. In the end, the sacrifice made by Sydney for Lucie's love is one of the most sensitive and touching love stories. Find a purpose for his life, knowing full well that his actions will live forever in the hearts of those for whom he sacrifices. I highly recommend that you own this DVD.

"b""This fun and entertaining crime caper has an exceptional cast and a lot of flavor to the south of the border making it a fun 88 minute movie. Borderline by William A. Seiter is a small, elegant film that has more in common with The Big Steal than with the film noir in which it is often advertised. It's a mixture of humor, crime and fun that grows on you more and more until its snappy end. It seems to be the L.A.P.D. and the US Treasury customs want to stop a drug smuggling ring that takes narcotics across the border from Mexico. Claire Trevor is the enthusiastic, if verdant, policeman of L.A. Madeline Haley, a former O.S.S. agent who makes his way into the assignment of going down south in an attempt to get information on the bad middleman Pete Ritche, hoping he will lead them to Mr. Big. The TV Perry Mason, Raymond Burr, is heavy with the white suit, Ritche, and plays the role with the threat.Madeline stumbles into Ritchie but before he can find anything, Johnny Mackland, an unknown player working for THE END of connection, hijack Ritchie's gold so he can make a deal for the next shipment. He ends up wearing Madeline with him after the guns have been drawn and the chase is over. The pursuit through Mexico, while trying to avoid Ritchie and evading the police, is a lot of fun. Madeline and Johnny begin to tell stories high and warm each other along the way. When Johnny's partner, Miguel, is hit, he has a body in his hands to face, further complicating the hunt. Fred MacMurray is as good as Johnny, the cop who does not know that Madeline is a policeman, who does not know he is a policeman! A sort of amusing, pulpy movie with more flavor than a habanero pepper, Trevor gives a good performance as he begins to appreciate Johnny, also becoming a little jealous of the young and kind daughter of a not too smart Mexican cop. He unknowingly helps them collect a plane to Encinada for the big problem. Like the two near the border, every regret must turn the other because they fell in love with each other. Once only those who work for those who have been straightened up, an enthusiastic shooting with Ritchie and his band culminates with a great ending for this very fun to watch movies. A film intended as entertainment, does not take itself too seriously, nor should you. Fans of genre films like this will have fun going south of the border with this one.""",1
"b""I watched the movie and I felt like I was missing pieces, that the scenes were shorter, even if they were missing entire scenes, but it had been so long since I saw that I was just thinking of remembering that the film was better than it was in reality. Then I looked at the director's comment. It took at least 15 minutes from the film. Most directors add to their films when they are given a chance, they do not take it away. The director's son has created a fragmentary and disjointed film very different from the original in the mood and plot. After years of waiting for the DVD release of Erik the Viking, I was extremely disappointed and a little angry at the way they were dealing with one of my favorite movies. I hope to see the Theater Release available for some time in the near future, as I do not think I'll watch this director's Son's Cut again, and I certainly will not share this version of the movie with friends and family as I originally intended.""",0

I have some objections to the film, first of all is that it unfolds on some very important facts explained in the book, according to the screenplay of the film have some differences with the original novel by Dan Brown: - At the beginning of the film you find Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks ) who signs his book at an event in Paris, while in the novel the book was still published. In connection with this scene, the French police take him to this event to go to the Louvre, while in the novel it was very late and he slept in the hotel. The entire Louvre escape sequence was much more exciting than the book, and it was too simplified in the film. The suspected conspiracy between the Vatican and Opus Dei has some twists in the book, and has been totally changed in the film. The relationship between the Vatican group and the Opus Dei group is described in greater detail. There is a lot of missing information on Silas, the albino monk. - Getting the safe from the Swiss bank was much more interesting in the book. there was another Criptek in the book. There are other crucial differences towards the medium and the end of the film, but I do not want to mention it, because if you have not read the book or you do not look like the movie will ruin the suspense for you.

"b'This film is very funny and much smarter than what some people will give it credit. Great comedy shows by Alan Cumming and Parker Posey, who chew enough scenes to create a soundstage. And the Pussycats are really funny, sexy girls: it\'s not Rachel Leigh Cook who steals the show like Josie, but Tara Reid, whose ridiculously blonde recalls the era of ""Laugh-In"" Goldie Hawn. A lot of great jokes (take the PG-13 version), totally ""jerkin"" costumes, some catchy songs ... and yes, all those product placements. (Clue: locate them makes a great, if fast drinking game!) If it\'s not the ""Heathers"" of the 00s, it\'s almost the ""Girls Just Wan na Have Fun"".'",1
"b'Having played both `` BloodRayne \'\' games, I\'m a fan of the series. So when I heard that they were making a movie, I was a bit interested. But basically I knew it would probably be disgusting. I was more than right. Unless you\'re interested in such a terrible shit to make you laugh, DO NOT BUY THIS FILM! It\'s a total disaster! Movie Rayne does not look like his video game counterpart. The combat scenes were slow, not at all like the fluidity of the game. And do not get me started seriously ... I\'ve seen better configurations in a haunted house. Nothing has been done realistically, and the ten-minute summary at the end of the film (which was done for some reason I will never understand) shows just how sloppy it is. The acting was not great, and the short sex scene ... let me say that I found myself laughing for most of this mess. Needless the day, the plot was also missing (and this is putting it lightly). If you want a vampire movie, take the ""Underworld"" movies. If you are a fan of ""BloodRayne"" looking for something that matches your fandom, repeat the game. You will get more satisfaction than you would do with this horrible interpretation.'",0
"b'I like Cheyenne, Maverick, Bronco, Lawman ... Warner Brothers Western of the late 50s and early 60s.

"b'I said it before, and I repeat: the studios really need to stop letting the small amateur production companies publish their films on DVD. This Laurel & Hardy DVD is a great example of why. The most obvious and irritating problem is that the soundtrack is not synchronized with the action; it\'s about 2 seconds back. Unless you like ""the guys"" it looks like a Japanese movie nicknamed, this will drive you crazy. Even the image quality is really poor; I have a VHS copy of `` Flying Deuces \'\' which looks better than this. The quiz game was a good idea, but poorly executed; ""what color are Stan Laurel\'s hair?"" ""As I would like to know - all their films are in black and white!"" I thought I could get a nice double feature at a good price, but in the end I got what I got paid: cheap movies Save your money.'",0

The only problem is that I would like to release for the Christmas holidays. Thanks for reading, and please go see the movie, and buy the DVD! !""",1
"b'The acting in this film stinks, laughing. Even Tara Reid can not save this film. What, Reid is a scientist because he wears glasses? He looks more like a gym coach. Is Christian Slater smarter? The direction is almost as bad as some of Ed Wood\'s films. The film may have had a science fiction plot, but the film barely explored any part of the plot. The film is not only ugly, sometimes it\'s boring, only stimulated by the fun of the scripts made horrible and meaningless. Mostly, this film incriminates its director. I give this film two stars out of five. At least this movie had images. I did not hate his stupidity as much as that other film based on a videogame, ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"", which I considered the worst film of his year.'",0
"b""I really like this practice. It's only 45 minutes long, has good editing choices and I like the instructions and the voice of Suzanne Deason.

Now, I can go on with Deason itself, and I rotate it with the strength and flexibility parts of the Yoga Conditioning for Athletes DVD (also good!), And Rodney Yee's Power Burn. Also, every morning I do a conditioning of A.M Yoga for weight loss or the sweetest A.M Yoga, all from Gaiam. I really like Deason & Yee. I've never felt better.""",1
"b""I had read all the reviews and thought that the bad ones were just people who had not made enough efforts, but believe me, I really tried. I still can not master the first dance, and I've been trying for over two weeks. When Tracy does the dance full time, she does not seem to match the moves she had undoed to learn. It's just small differences and I'm sure someone with a better dance experience or more coordination might be able to do it. I think if you could master the moves it would be great, so I'm really disappointed that I have not been able to deal with it. However I also have the mat training and its post pregnancy dvd and they are both brilliant. Obviously they are not cardio, but they are really good at toning the problematic points.""",0
"b'First of all ; I like Troma movies. I\'m not ashamed either. I like science fiction. I also thought that watching ""The postman"" was a decent way to spend a Thursday evening. But this ... Battlefield Earth created the strangest atmosphere in my living room. The usual comments never came. People looked at one another with a sad and empty look in their eyes. It\'s not even funny. The only fun part is that John Travolta tried to get this film made for a decade ... I do not understand why they had a list of cast actors in the cast. See, they do not even tell you what the names of the characters are. Not until they die anyway. And in the end, when they get together and say ""Carlo did it!"", You do not even know who Carlo was or what the poor actually did.With regards to credibility, well, I mean it\'s Sci-Fi. Do not watch science fiction for this, but I have yet to quote this sentence from the film: Caveman in a military flight simulator: ""You\'re right! It\'s just like riding a horse! ""It\'s nice that it\'s so easy, because otherwise the ID4 style air-to-air combat scene that would take place a week later would have been impossible."" Well, what would you expect from a group of people who joined a cult started by a science fiction author, I\'m not going to say anything else.'",0
"b'This is the first time I\'ve reviewed anything on the web, but I felt the need to comment on this film. Obviously the film as Homer Simpson would say is the most sucking sucker that has ever been sucked. Virtually everything that Uwe Boll, also known as ""Boll Bolletta"", has sucked in hell. Being able to watch a film by this director would be to get drunk or stoned or both. Even then it may not be enough. The good news is to use his films as an instrument of torture for terrorists. Someone suggested that the only thing that Boll should direct is a porn movie. I beg to differ . I\'m sure he will also find a way to ruin it. He probably would have focused on the man\'s member instead of the woman. No, the only thing that Boll should direct should be the end of his career. What is incredibly fun in this film are the reviews of this site and the critics on the rottentomatoes. As I read them, I burst out laughing on several occasions for minutes. The comment of a previous critic on how the prostitutes of the film were true Romanian prostitutes is a revolt. I will not even go into the plot because it is irrelevant so for all those who have not watched the movie, do yourself a favor and read the reviews. It\'s much more fun and will surely make you laugh out loud.'",0
"b'A feuding ruffian through post-war New York and Louisiana, \'Angel Heart\' tells a very old story from a surprisingly original and wonderfully chilling corner. The plot, centered on an increasingly violent person\'s disappearance case, is reasonably simple, but the background that triggers it is noticeably complex. When you reassemble the pieces at the end it makes sense, but only right. De Niro is superb as Louis Cyphre, the ""businessman"" with some collectible guarantees, infusing the role with the right balance of sardonic humor and demonic threat. Mickey Rourke gives what probably will always be his best interpretation as Harry Angel, a shell-shocked war veteran and the disordered P.I. The supporting cast is excellent, especially Charlotte Rampling as an occultist, and Lisa Bonet as a teenage voodoo witch. But the real star here is screenwriter / director Alan Parker. He has an extraordinary talent for the simple but strongly disturbing image: a slow zoom on the outside wall of a New York hotel; a New Year\'s crowd at Times Square; a descending elevator; a wide staircase; the rotating blades of a fan. These images are simple, cold, but positively full of infernal threat. The music of Trevor Jones is the perfect accompaniment, his saxophones that wildly crowd on threatening rhythms and the omnipresent pulse of a beating heart. It is a deeply disturbing marriage that will make us fear to close around with the same grim certainty of the protagonist\'s destiny.'",1
"b""It is the same DVD of Death By Decibels .. Read the reviews. The producers have released the same DVD, which BTW has little to do with the band, with different titles with different covers to catch the fans of a band with which the producers have nothing to do. The cover does not give you the slightest idea that the Deftones are not on this DVD. I too was robbed buying Muse DVD twice from producers who had nothing to do with the band. In the future I will read a review of a music DVD before buying from a music store. This type of poop only serves to hurt bands, music stores and the music industry in general. As a fan, I feel like I've been robbed and I've got stuff from the Internet for free, so make sure I do not waste my hard-earned money.""",0

"b""I bought this DVD from Amazon, mind you, although it may not seem like it, because I recently changed my email address and received another account. In any case, I hardly ever write more than 3 or 4 reviews, but this is one of those rare exceptions. I watched this film for the second time a few days ago, and strangely, the impact was even bigger than the first time. Keep playing in my head all day. Some details that had escaped I noticed now. Despite what someone might say, I can not think of anything more beautiful and pure than the love that the boy clearly felt for his soldier. Reading some reviews, I tend to agree with many of them. They say they are extremely saddened. One woman said she felt she had to tuck him up and tell him that his prince would be back. Another boy said that he wondered if the soldier really knew how much the child loved him. Rudi Van Dantzig died in January this year, and someone said he would finally meet his soldier. Touching. They say the book is not so romantic. Well, I could not read it, but judging from the film, it's hard to imagine someone who would not like to live such an intense, though brief, and careless love story. The reason for the ill-fated end remains always a mystery, and this, in my opinion, adds to magic. I will not repeat here what was said about the actors. They are really good. However, a special remark about the boy and the soldier: they are really convincing, and sometimes you also get the impression that they are really enjoying it. The boy has that kind of unusual and fleeting beauty you see once in your life. His eyes look sad, even when he smiles. Of course there will always be those who are ready to criticize it, but this is to be expected. Let's face it: some things are not meant for everyone. From a technical point of view, my only complaint is that, unfortunately, the image quality is not superior, but the film itself is more than compensated. And I will watch it again! ! !""",1
"b""It's hard to find the words to start describing this fantastic show. First of all, writing is superb. There are elements of this story that cause the viewer to jump online, or run to the local library to find out more about what is presented. There is a richness in the narrative that is not often seen on television today. For everything we are told, there are almost twenty things that are not told ... that really involve the spectator in the show. It encourages active vision, speculation, discussion and research among other things. This does not mean that you can not just watch the show and get a supreme level of fun. The first season, I was an almost active spectator, and I still found it the best show I had ever seen. The images created by the dialogue are incredible. And of course, what is a great writing without a great talent for providing lines? At the forefront, there are powerful actors like Clancy Brown in the role of conflicting brother Justin, and Nick Stahl as the quiet but intriguing Ben Hawkins. Seeing the seemingly unrelated stories between these two evolving characters is an incredible event. The show also includes Tim DeKay, Clea Duvall, Cynthia Ettinger, Amy Madigan, Michael J. Anderson, Toby Huss, Brian Turk, Adrienne Barbeau, John Savage and even Pa Walton himself, Ralph Waite. If one is a fan of any of these actors, their talents are highlighted in this series. Emotions grow throughout the first season and these actors know exactly how to portray them. And what is the great writing and the beautiful acting without a spectacular drop back for the action? From the windy Dustbowl sandstorms in Oklahoma to the beautiful rural California countryside, every set is perfect. In the eyes are given beautiful images to be absorbed. Finally, and above all, the pure involvement of the archive alone. As I said earlier, this show makes an active spectator. If ever, for a moment, you believed in the age of wonder ... the magic of the past ... this series is definitely worth it. Elements of our daily lives are challenged and a whole new world is created before your eyes. I challenge anyone who purchases the DVDs of the first season to watch only one episode at a time. Look at one and wait a week before seeing another one. I bet you can not. You will be impatient to see what will happen next. If you did not think it was possible with a TV show, remember ... it's not television ... it's HBO.""",1
"b'Very disappointing. After waiting so long for Battlestar, which is the best TV series, Razor left a lot to be desired. Irregular stimulation, disconnected narration and none of the new characters were very interesting. Wait until this is back on Sci Fi and save $.'",0
"b'I must admit with a little shame that before this film I did not know who Harvey Pekar was. But this did not limit my ability to enjoy this film, which was one of the most interesting I\'ve seen for a long time. The theme of the film as a whole is brilliantly summarized in the first seconds of the film. Several guys go to a Halloween house, all in costume like Superheroes except a boy, who is dressed only as himself: Harvey Pekar. The film as a whole speaks of Pekar\'s attempt to recount his banal, boring and disappointing life in a comic book. Instead of a comic book about superheroes, he imagines a comic book about himself, an archivist at the Veterans Hospital in Cleveland. The film tells the story of Pekar\'s life in varying degrees of detail, emphasizing his encounter with R. Crumb in the \'60s and Crumb led him to start a comic, despite his inability to draw. Taking part in his life, involving friends and colleagues, designing the frames of comics and then engaging artists to illustrate his stories (many of Crumb in person), Pekar manages to create something unique, fun and, in his own strange way, triumphant and beautiful. The film implies that we can all be the heroes of our history. It does not happen much in the film, but despite all this it manages to be compelling. The great events of the narration are the meeting of Pekar R. Crumb, his decision to write his comic book, meet his wife, a series of guest appearances in the late \'80s on the Dave Letterman Show and his meeting with cancer . In all this, there is no attempt to make Pekar look better than it is. He is portrayed as unattractive, a little strange, a chronic underachiever, more than a little neurotic and extremely self-absorbed. But despite everything, there is honesty in looking at his life and painting it as it is, warts and everything else. The way he tackles everything with a tireless sense of humor and his determination to do something to give his life a focal point and purpose is heroic in a very real and concrete way, as opposed to the fake, heroic heroism of Superman , Batman, or the Green Lantern. It would be difficult to exaggerate with Paul Giamatti playing Harvey Pekar or Hope Davis in the role of Joyce Brabner, the woman who marries Pekar. Both the real Pekar and the real Brabner also appear on the camera, as do most of the real-life models for Pekar characters. In fact, the way in which the narration of the film flows seamlessly between the individuals of real life, the actors, the comics depictions is one of the strengths of the film. In one scene, Paul Giamatti playing Pekar and Judah Friedlander playing Pekar\'s friend (and MTV\'s minor celebrity) Toby Radloff are on screen while real Harvey Pekar and Toby Radloff have a conversation. In another part of the film, Hope Davis and Paul Giamatti are presumably backstage at the Dave Letterman show, but when Giamatti and Pekar go out to the stage with Letterman, he cuts the footage of the real Pekar interviewed by Letterman. I was reminded of the famous painting by Margritte, where he painted a pipe with the words ""This is not a pipe"" below. Moving from the real Pekar to an actor playing it, it\'s a way of saying ""This is not Harvey Pekar"" every time Giamatti is on screen. Furthermore, it suggests that Giamatti is a cinematic equivalent of the various Pekars drawn in comics. This is a great movie, and I hope it gets the attention it deserves. It\'s very different from the CRUMB movie, but I imagine it will appeal especially to those who enjoyed that weird but fascinating documentary.'",1
"b'I will not rule out Hilary Duff as a previous review, because I actually think it was the best part of this film, hence the only star. It\'s fun and feminine but I could not enjoy it because of the constant stereotypes (for example the blonde girl enters the business world and knows nothing apart from the way she uses color, as well as the consistent way in which the female characters they judge men from their \'hot abs\' or \'tight asses\'). She seems a bit sexist for both male and female characters, and although I know that most of the chick movies are so to a certain extent, it\'s never been to the extent that I felt the need to shut down. The accent of the English boy is ridiculous. Why do not they just use English to portray the English rather than people whose accent is between Australian and American? The other characters in addition to Lane are rather trash and wood, including his best friend and more or less all the people he works with. The story, I imagine, is carefree and pretty, but if you have an ounce of intellect and do not assume that all women are bimbos whose subject is the overcoat and the value of men is valued by the estate of their sandwiches, I suggest looking elsewhere. I was also a bit worried about sexual references (ie painting the other bodies with chocolate and then ""burning"" after an appointment, talking about climaxing etc.). Surely it is a bit \'too much for a younger audience?'",0
"b""I believe that the excellence of the Waitress is in itself, but my desire to appreciate it has undoubtedly been amplified by the post-production tragedy of the murder of writer / director Adrienne Shelly. I think co-star Cheryl Hines says it best in the featurette: Shelly's tragic and senseless death forces you to watch the film through a different prism. I was surprised that Keri Russell was not nominated for the actress's best prizes. I thought it was exceptional. She is in every scene. His performance brings the film. It's really a series of interactions between her and her husband Earl (a wonderfully unlikely Jeremy Sisto), she and the client / owner Old Joe (a skeptical Andy Griffith) and she and the doctor / alternate Dr. Pomatter. In particular, the relationship between Russell's Jenna and Nathan Fillion's Pomatter is very well interpreted, both by the actors themselves and by Shelly's strong writing and direction. You will miss.""",1
"b""The Beverly Hills policeman did not need any introduction. It was one of the best action comedies of 1984. It helped Eddie Murphy's usher in the mainstream and reigned supreme 1984. Beverly Hills Cop II was pretty good. A little exaggerated but still fun. He complimented the film style of Tony Scott and also captured the essence of the 80s. This monstrosity is immediately forgettable from beginning to end. A bust becomes horribly wrong and Inspector Todd (Gilbert R Hill) is killed. Axel (Eddie Murphy) tracks the killer known as Ellis De Wald (Timothy Carhart) for a Disney cheese knock-off called Wonderworld, where Ellis De Wald is the supervisor. Where should I start first? Axel Foley does not even feel like Axel Foley (a bit like Big Top Pee Wee is different from Big Adventure's Pee Wee). Eddie spends the whole movie with the air of not being able to understand what his character should be. Gone is the tenacious but silly policeman who has bothered his goal. He is replaced by a boy who is so relaxed in his demeanor that it becomes boring to look after a while. The only returning characters are Inspector Todd (but he is killed at first) and Rosewood (Judge Reinhold). Taggart is gone and so is the sergeant. Bogomil. This was the suggestion that this movie was DOA. The first two BHC films have had quite good inhabitants considering the period of time. Victor Maitland and The Alphabet Killer were good inhabitants but Ellis De Wald is horrible. No disrespect towards Timothy Carhart, but it was rather lovable and his mother's plan was weak and showed laziness on behalf of the writers. Using an amusement park to make counterfeit money? The film is rarely entertaining and reporting Serge (Bronson Pinochet) was an economic attempt to make us remember the first interaction Serge and Axel Foley had in the first film. There is a moment of salvation in this film: the malfunctioning run sequence in the park where Axel saves two children. This scene is the only reason I gave him two stars. Humor for the most part is forced and if you ever hear that annoying signature for Wonderworld it will be too soon. Who thought it was a fun plot plot anyway? In conclusion, this film has killed a promising series. It is a pity that behind this mess is the director himself (John Landis) behind Animal House, Blues Brothers, Coming To America and a few other favorite films of mine. John Landis is a great director but not a great director for this type of film. Thumb down.""",0

"b'In films, as in most other art forms, the greatest work often comes in the smallest of packages. This is the case of ""The Five Senses"", an independent Canadian production that chooses for its subject nothing less profound than a meditation on what it means to be human. The writer / director Jeremy Podeswa has modeled a work of great poetic form and intuition centered on a group of people who share the universal need to find true love and acceptance in a world in which relationships wounded and destroyed too often they result in a loneliness and a despair amplified. Like all of us, each of these characters focuses on the double ends of intimacy with others and on the acceptance of oneself that are essential to human happiness. Some succeed, while others fail - just like in life - but none of the characters remained unchanged from the experience. ""The Five Senses"", even if it has a plot, is more an emotional piece than a narrative-driven drama. Equipped with an exceptional ensemble cast, Podeswa is able to draw us into the center of his world through the use of sensory images and a deliberate and methodical rhythm. In fact, one of the strongest themes in the film is the examination of the part that our senses play in defining our world and our character. Podeswa understands that we have become desensitized to our senses. As a result, use this film to reconnect with that crucial element of our beings. The silent and silent tone, the silent autumn colors, the slow moving camera, the disturbing musical score combine to create an atmosphere in which the public can become aware of every sight and sound coming on our way. In our effort to establish meaningful intimacy with other human beings, we typically rely on the sense of touch - however, this can serve, Podeswa shows us, to the point of trapping us in a false intimacy that leads us into one that is genuine and lasting. Some of his characters use sex as a substitute for true closeness, while others make a physical connection at a much deeper level. One of the film\'s most moving moments occurs when a gay man - most likely an AIDS patient - breaks into tears during a massage session, his heart broken because no one has dared to touch him in such a long time. This film recognizes the vital part that the tender physical contact plays in the totality of a person\'s humanity. In a similar way, the film explores the beauty of sound, as one of the characters - ironically, an ophthalmologist, a man dedicated to preserving the organ of a certain sense - faces the prospect of loathing deafness and longs for a catalog mental of all the exquisite sounds of everyday life that will soon be unable to hear and which we usually give. However, like all the other characters, it is his spiritual emptiness and the inability to establish a meaningful connection with another human being that brings him his greatest obstacles to happiness. Podeswa also examines the part that the olfaction plays in making that vital human connection, since one of the characters - a gay homosexual - revisits his former lovers to take a breath of their scent in an attempt to find out if he can sniff ""true love"" "". `` However `` The Five Senses\' \'is not simply a film built on a skilled `gimmick\'. ""On the contrary, it breathes with the fullness of humanity because each of its many characters emerges as a fully developed and immediately recognizable human being.There are teenagers alienated from their own inability to adapt to the accepted norm of society and make themselves feel guilty for their acts of irresponsible irresponsibility.There are mothers terrified of losing their children, in one case, literally, while his girlfriend goes away and disappears and, in another case, in a figurative sense, while the teenage daughter seems to slip away into a \' inexplicable ""strangeness."" ""There are adults unable to understand a life full of failed relationships that seek despair for that last chance of happiness, often with the result that they end up farther than from that universally desired goal that ever . One of the most daring aspects of ""The Five Senses"" is that it does not give in to the temptation of providing a ""happy"" or even conclusive ending for all of its characters. The film recognizes that life is a disordered, endless process of change of fortune and personal growth and remains faithful to that theme until the end. This brave, haunting and fascinating film is surely one of the real discoveries of recent years - a true work of art!'",1

The film moves, and it is obvious how the conclusion will end in the middle of the film. A special mention goes to the final line of the film addressed directly to the public ""And I bet you thought it was the butler all the time."" Also of extreme annoyance is the closing music, which adjoins the unlistenable. this two-star movie (generously) for the hilarious but exhilarating performance of John Carradine - truly a master of horror in his day, but an even bigger master of having made the survivors when his day had passed.'",0

Some members of the Federation are firmly opposed to accepting them. Reasons range from feuds to the desire of criminals to steal Dylithium\'s precious crystals from the planet - Federation protection would put an end to such criminal adventures of other members of the Federation. Among the delegates are the Vulcans, the Andorians and an alien delegation with a dirty face. that seem to cross between Bassett Hounds and the Ugnaught from the ""Return of the Jedi"" with obsessively empty eyes and an irascible temperament. The makeup on the Andorians was extraordinarily well done for the period. When Ambassador Vulcan Sarek and his wife Amanda embark on the Enterprise, there is obvious tension and Sarek asks someone who is not Spock his ""tour guide"" of the ship. It is therefore revealed that Sarek and Amanda are Spock\'s parents. Jane Wyatt is the extravagant wife and mother who has subdued many of her emotions to accommodate Sarek, but still makes her break out from time to time. Mark Lenard begins his long career as Sarek, which we continue to see until his death in one of the last seasons of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". ""Sarek did not talk to Spock in 4 years, and he was angry that his son had refused to study the same subjects he and his father had studied, but there were still angry, quiet silences between them, and Amanda had to run back and forth placate them both in his gentle way.One of the grizzly-faced aliens, a surly named Gaz, confronts Sarek in the hall and threatens him when Sarek declares his intention to vote for the Coridans\' acceptance.A shortly thereafter, Gaz is found, killed An autopsy reveals that his neck was broken at a point that would cause instant death, Spock recognizes it as a form of death penalty used on Vulcan centuries earlier, favored for its speed and painless delivery. method called Tal-Shaya, well known to his father.An interesting tidbit that the Romulan equivalent of the KGB is called Tal-Shayar in the episodes of Next Gen - the Romulans are distant cousins \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bof the Vulcans and their tongues have or undoubtedly common roots ... perhaps the English translation of the Tal-Shayar is `` the murderers of the neck \'\'? Anyhoo, Sarek is considered a suspect, but is eliminated when it is obvious that a defective heart valve kept him out of action. A risky operation requires that Spock, the only Vulcan on board with the same rare T-negative blood, supplies nearly half his blood during a transfusion. Because they could not take a pint a day is beyond me. Spock prepares to be the source of blood for his father when Kirk is attacked by an Andorian. The Andorian clearly hits Kirk in the lower back, near his kidneys in the attack just before Kirk pulls him back and puts him out of action. Kirk approaches her side and raises a bloody hand and uses the wall mounted intercom to ask for help just before losing consciousness. In the infirmary, we see Kirk with a bandage around his bare chest. Now we are told that his lung was punctured and the Andorian barely missed his heart. Considering that he was using a small knife he could not have reached from his ass to the heart, I think they would have to repeat the battle scene, but it\'s just me. It is as if the lung injury were a rethinking of the battle scene and perhaps the writers thought that the audience would not ""get"" a kidney injury in the way they would understand how a lung injury would have left him breathless. Eh, anything. Bad continuity in those scenes, in both cases. Spock suddenly refuses to help in his father\'s surgery. He must instead command the Enterprise because there was a murder on board the Enterprise, an attempted murder, quarreling between the delegates and there an unidentified alien ship chased them, barely out of reach of their sensors and weapons. Disoriented Kirk wakes up at Sick Bay, said the news and must find a way to bring Spock on the operating table without violating Federation regulations and Vulcan\'s oath to duty and logic. A subsequent interrogation and research of the Andorian who attacked Kirk results in some interesting results that will take you to the edge of your seat. Despite some cheeses here and there, this is one of the most exciting episodes of the old series. An excellent show.'",1
"b'Stephen King is best known for his books on the macabre, but what some people do not know is that he is also a master of comedy - as in ""The Langoliers"". The book was a very complex and exhilarating study of the human mind. The film digs deeper, showing how amusing people can be in the face of eminent destruction. The film and the book ask the question: ""What would you do if you fell asleep on a plane, but all those who were awake, are dead and one of the people on your plane is a psychopath, and another is a blind girl who can perceive the evil, a bit like Haley Joel Osment in ""The Sixth Sense"", then look for shelter in an airport, but all the carbonated drinks are flat and the food is spoiled, so find out that these creatures are similar to Pac-Man ("" the Langolieri "") literally consume the past?"" Well, what would you do? It\'s a complicated question, and to be honest with you, I do not know what I\'d do. But I can say one thing, Bronson Pinchot (in a performance that is quite a detachment from his beloved Balki Bartokomous character in the popular TV show, ""Perfect Strangers"") does not know how to answer the question. Friend, he\'s crazy - and I\'m not talking about Riggs in ""The lethal weapon"" - I mean he gets really crazy. You can say that Pinchot really embraced this role for what it was and brought the method to act on a whole new level. Are not you convinced yet? After all the laughs and slapstick routines (the scene where Dean Stockwell drinks beer at the airport is absolutely brilliant!), It was a fantastic chase scene, full of suspense, where the langoliers chase the plane in run along the escape. Just as the plane is preparing to take off the razor-sharp teeth of Langoliers ... Sorry, but you\'ll have to watch the movie to find out how it ends. That is, if the langolieri do not reach you first.'",1

"b'This biopic, taken from John Denver\'s Take Me Home, will be appreciated by hardcore fans (like me) but it\'s still terrible in many ways. The story begins in the early 60s when John (Chad Lowe) began his career as a folk singer. Meet Annie (Kristin Davis) at a concert and fall in love with the place. They marry and move to Aspen, but as John\'s career takes off, tension increases in marriage. They divorce, have a second short marriage, and discovers his love for the flight, something that eventually earns the respect of his strict father (Gerald McRaney). This film is a summary of John\'s life of Cliffs Notes; it is badly written and amateurish and lacks depth or emotion. Lowe (wearing a horrible clown wig that makes him look like Dana Carvey in ""Waynes World"") shamelessly wanders around, playing an innocent mischievous man who never seems to grow up. (Actually, although the film has been covering for thirty years, nobody is aging.) Davis is very pretty, but the horrible script does not give her much development. McRaney plays the only character that looks real, and is the villain of the piece. The story is superficial and Lowe\'s Denver is not particularly nice. His hair is so ridiculous and distracting that the film has no chance. Even though we listen to Denver singing many of his songs, Lowe is terrible with lip sync. Extra DVDs are useless; where are some shots of the real JD we loved?'",0

"b'Wish You Were Here was the next album of Pink Floyds, a very successful commercial album, Dark Side Of The Moon, which, among other great songs, perhaps contained their signature, ""Money"". Released in September 1975, Wish You Were Here is the favorite album of many band members and fans. When he hit the streets, he went straight to number one on the album charts in both the United States and the United States. From the first four notes, the base of the song invokes a sadness, which is the story of Syd Barrett. Recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London in numerous sessions. Although some of these sessions were problematic, it was Roger Waters\' idea to split the central track ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"" into two parts and join each half with three new compositions. ""Shine On"" was a tribute to Barrett, who coincidentally made an impromptu visit to the studio while recording. Wish You Were Here is the second concept album by Pink Floyd written entirely by Waters. He reflects his feeling that the friendship that had cemented the band was, by now, largely absent. Deeply immersed in the themes of absence, the greed of the musical business and Barrett. The album begins with a long instrumental preamble and follows the lyrics of ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"", a tribute to Syd Barrett, whose mental exhaustion forced him to leave the band several years earlier. Barrett is fondly remembered with phrases like ""Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun"" and ""You reached the secret too early, you cried for the moon"". This simultaneous version on Blu-Ray and DVD is the authorized story of the album and was made with the full involvement of the band members. The film is full of new interviews with Roger Waters, David Gilmour and Nick Mason and interviews with the late Richard Wright archive. The sleeve designer Storm Thorgerson, guest vocalist Roy Harper and the ""burning man"" frontman Ronnie Rondell and other staff involved in making the album are also included. The band members talk about the first difficulties of the first recording sessions and how the decision to divide `` Shine On \'\' became the catalyst. Other interesting insights revealed through the interviews are the fact that before Barrett left the band, he had surrendered or given up wanting to make music to ""hit"". he did not want to make music for ""Top Of The Pops"" and, ironically, the band members transfer the blame from the greed of the music business to themselves as the main impetus for wanting to make the music more acceptable commercially, if I\'m not exactly ""pop"" songs. The film is also full of excerpts from concerts and shows, as well as pieces from the band that process the parts. Pink Floyd: The story of Wish You Were Here is a fascinating documentary and a tribute to the band in creating the masterwork album . For occasional fans, collectors and musicologists, this is what you would like to add to your collection. if you are an aspiring musician, then you will play over and over again just to take a look at the creative concept. Dyd Barrett has been active in music for about seven years, recording four singles, the Pink Floyd debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (and contributed to the second), as well as several unpublished songs with Pink Floyd. In 1969, Barrett released a single soloist, ""Octopus"", which foreshadowed his first (of two) solo album, The Madcap Laughs (1970), which was recorded over the course of a year (1968-1969) with 4 different producers among including David Gilmour and Roger Waters. Nearly two months after Madcaps was released, Barrett began work on his second album, Barrett, produced by Gilmour and Richard Wright, which was released in the late 1970s before entering self-imposed isolation that lasted over thirty years. Barrett\'s groundbreaking guitar work and the exploration of experimental techniques such as the use of dissonance, distortion and feedback have had an enormous legacy not only by setting the direction that Floyd would have brought without him, but by the musicians David Bowie to Brian Eno to Jimmy Page and other influence. After suffering from diabetes for several years, Barrett died at his home in Cambridge on July 7, 2006. He was 60 years old. The cause of death was pancreatic cancer. The occupation on his death certificate was given as a ""retired musician"". ""According to local newspapers, Barrett left about 1.7 million to his two brothers and two sisters.This sum was apparently largely acquired from Pink Floyd compilation royalties and live recordings with songs he had written while he was with the band.The Dirty Lowdown'",1

"b'It seemed that this film was intended for that age group (13-16 years) or the film director / director in which that old man did this shit. The director\'s comment changed my opinion on the first film, so I thought the director\'s comment would change his mind about this. No, he\'s not so lucky. The acting was so bad that it made me laugh out loud. The complete madness of the `` general \'\' making a total ass of himself and saying these stupid and stupid things made me say `` wow \'\' aloud more times.The premise of the first film was to conclude that at war all governments eventually turn into fascist governments. When I say ""transform into"" I do not mean literally. Only they behave and produce these results. This came directly from the director\'s mouth during his commentary and this is what he was trying to get across.As I listened to this comment (there are two of them - one from the director and the other from the director / cast) I did not really understand what they were trying to say. Of course, there was the ending in which the director was saying that the state will use religion to its advantage. If he interferes with them, they will try to eliminate it, if they think they can use it for an advantage, they would. Regardless of these `` messages \'\' that they were trying to convey, it was done in an amateur way and I give sci-fi a lot of room for maneuver when it comes to suspending belief, however I have limits. There was something that had happened to me and it could happen to you too. The way these people behave would tend to make me believe that a highly advanced technological society could in fact be extremely sloppy and inefficient. Anyone in our army (like me) would have thought of a million better ways to protect the base and fight these bugs. Even with our weapons today, our military could put down a volume of fire that would have destroyed these insects. For a company that has been at war with these bugs for the last 10 years it would have made any government fire the contractor or advanced weapons division that continues to use such ineffective firearms they use, marauding in the end in spite of. The level of insubordination in these soldiers is surprising given the extreme threat and in some cases led to punishment. But I guess it\'s part of the point; that a totalitarian society could actually produce armies with methods and leadership that is highly dysfunctional.These are some of the things that come to mind, even if you can get that from the first movie without wasting your time on this villain.

"b""As a fan of occult horror films, I'm always looking for a good movie - they're few and far between. `` Hell's Gate 1111 '' came very badly close. It had a great premise, and although the plot was a bit murky during the first half of the film, it moved and straightened quite nicely towards the end. The problem with the film was the end. It was too abrupt and so confused that one wondered if it was not completely complete. Personally, I think the production company ran out of money and just slapped some alternative shots to finish it off.""",0

"b'Here I am 50 years after the release of this film by writing a positive review of this film. The plot is relatively complex for this era. Show how a player was gradually involved in something he never planned. His motives could also be considered somehow admirable, since he had in mind the interest of his girlfriend and his little brother in deciding, reluctantly, to be involved. The subtle nature of temptation is conveyed by the fact that it is not called to lose any game, simply to play bad enough to be close. Marshall Thompson plays the main role of Johnny Long. The sports journalist Pete Ferreday is played by John Ireland. The script is written in such a way as to bring out the nuances of the characters. Felix Feist did a nice noir-ish movie. Everything comes together in a way to get your attention to the end.'",1
"b""Louisombe of Lacombe, Lucien still impresses, even if he tends to free himself in the third act just when one might expect him to tighten his grip. But it is still a casually strong reminder of the less heroic side of France under the Vichy domain (the Nazis are just seen in the film) as its no too bright farmboy just drifting almost by accident in collaboration with the German police fully realized of its compatriots after being rejected for the Resistance. The film 's important result is in showing, just like fascism in general, the appeal that the collaboration has had to the unhappy and the underachieving outsiders in the community (only one of the `police' is a real zealot) and the attraction of undeserved and undeserved power as Lucien finds the power he has over people (notably the unspoken threat of delivering his Jewish 'girlfriend' - perhaps a little more symbolically called 'France' - to the Germans) is much more intoxicating than killing mere animals.Throughout, as with Melville's masterpiece of resistance L'Arm\xc3\xa9e des Ombres, there is a worldly sense of reality that increases drama. Located in the kind of quaint little village that strangers find idyllic but that is a tedious hell in which to live for the locals, it shows how discomfort and opportunities are much more than a driving force of malice. Certainly it is anything but glamorous, its associates hanging around in a local hotel get drunk and complaining about their fate as war news gets worse and worse (as it is emphasized, you need to listen to both German and the British radio reports `` e divide the difference '' to find the truth) and gradually get collected off the locals.The encouraged unique extra on Criterion's disk is the theatrical fantasy trailer, so this might be worth collecting in Criterion's casket, which also includes Au Revoir Les Enfants, Murmur of the Heart and an exclusive extra album focusing mainly on Louis Malle rather than on the films themselves.""",1

He goes in search to find the car to change the desire; in the meantime he gets a job with a toy company. Basically the film becomes a long joke about a ""child"" in the adult world, but it also tends to other issues - the loss of innocence and that superficial honesty that is so prevalent in childhood and then disappears into adulthood. Hanks, of course, is a hit with the toy company (what would not be 13 years old?). But he falls in love with a colleague, which again makes the decision to return to 13 at the most excruciating end.

"b'Robert Duvall shows a little originality in this captivating film. I say captivating, I could not turn it off, the dialouge was very realistic almost with a documentary margin, the action was not overly conspicuous or excessive had a realistic grit, and I had to know how it would end. Being an artistic end, you really do not know what will happen to our protaganist, assassin at the end. Launch the original word in this work for a couple of reasons. The main character, `` John Anderson \'\' played by Duvall (though like the same character we\'ve seen playing before) is a hit man with a difference, not much macho posture being used creating this vulnerable, aging and somewhat professional displeased . He is not sorry for the ""works"" he has interpreted, but he has not established real roots as he approaches the twilight of his life. But now she has a girl with a ten-year-old daughter, and her love and devotion for this child shines, as well as Duvall\'s love of the Tango, which is so well represented many times for the loving camera by very attractive Argentineans . Both young and old. The plot of the murder is overshadowed by the Tango for much of the film, and when Duvall takes us back to its whole purpose of being in Argentina, we are sorry to have to leave this wonderful dance behind. There are one or two moments when Duvall\'s scenes may have been strengthened, but I never thought it was really big negatives. All in all, I would recommend this film to lovers of independent cinema, dance and fans of Robert Duvall.'",1

His portrait as the great artist is imminent and shows a tender side. Furthermore, Rex Harrison as Pope Julius II is also extraordinary. The two men create a refined chemistry of the rebel artist and the severe and feeling pontiff who commits the Buonarroti to the great task of the Sistine.

"b'Almost nine years after seeing the film for the first time and almost 34 years after the events that inspired it, the film ""Apollo 13"" seems even more appealing. The story of Apollo 13, for anyone who has followed the space program and, in particular, for those who have witnessed it, is a compelling story as told in American history. It is full of drama, intrigue, twists and thrills. Furthermore, everything really happened! In April 1970, the American public was already witnessing the extraordinary success of landing on the Moon as a pass-on; and he could not care less about the Apollo 13 mission. The interest was so apathetic that the astronaut who was transmitting when the ship was about to enter the lunar orbit was not even brought to television. The fickle public had certainly aroused his interest when, not long after the uncontrolled transmission, a simple maneuver of cleaning the house (mixing the oxygen tanks) exposed a fatal flaw that led to a tremendous explosion. That explosion sent Apollo 13 out of control, it ended all hope of landing on the Moon and left the fate of the three astronauts (commander Jim Lovell, LM pilot Fred Haise and the command module pilot Jack Swigert) were very much in doubt. The heroic efforts made by Mission Control members, as well as by the astronauts themselves, bring the Apollo 13 to Earth safely is one of the greatest stories ever told. The acclaimed director, Ron Howard, saw it and, inspired by Lovell \'The personal story of that mission created one of the truly great historical movies I\'ve ever seen on screen. ""Apollo 13"" is a true cinematic goal. It rekindles the imagination and it is surprising that the space program took place in the 60s and early 70s. Using cutting-edge special effects at the service of history (instead of in place), Howard is able to offer the public a real close-up view of the entire Apollo mission. Using the repertoire material to create special effects scenes, the director is able to make the launch realistic, as if the observer were standing on the tower watching the rocket that was about to rise. The scenes in space are well done and extraordinarily realistic. When the astronauts are forced to extinguish much of the lunar module and the whole command module, to conserve the abject power, cold and abandonment that these men have been forced to endure, they are perceived by the public. The real sign of the greatness of this film lies in the fact that, although we know from history that the men of Apollo 13 survived, the last moments during the re-entry, as interpreted in the film, are still incredibly compelling and tense. So, the emotional release that comes from knowing that it is done is so overwhelming that even the most cynical and hard spectator will be suffocated by emotion. The narrative and effects of ""Apollo 13"" are great, but the film would probably still have been short if not for the huge cast hired to play these roles. Tom Hanks is as robust as Jim Lovell imperturbable, Bill Paxton (who seems to always find a way in every success) is as good as the trusty, but inexperienced novice Fred Haise, and Kevin Bacon offers an accurate portrait of the last-minute substitute Jack Swigert. Gary Sinise plays Ken Mattingly, astronaut Swigert replaced due to fears of a measles infection, with appropriate melancholy. The other truly exceptional performance was filmed by Ed Harris, who plays the no-frills rock of a flight director, Gene Kranz. Harris really deserved his Oscar nomination for this performance and there is certainly a strong argument for winning the Supporting Actor winner, Kevin Spacey. `` Apollo 13 \'\', in turn, was a strong contender for the best honors films, losing only the worthy `` Braveheart \'\'. The only disconcerting question is why Ron Howard was omitted from the Best Director nominations (he would have to wait another 7 years before receiving the ""A Beautiful Mind"" award). ""Apollo 13"" is not just a big thriller; it is also a lesson in narrative history. It allows us to remember those wonderful days of searching for the Moon, as well as the drama of that flight in danger. These days, it is disheartening to realize how the space program has stagnated since those intoxicating days. ""Apollo 13"" demonstrates, beyond any doubt, that we still have men with the will, the knowledge and the courage to bring this space exploration to places beyond imagination.'",1
"b""Zatoichi Vol. Quattro are as good as the first three volumes. Like some of the other episodes, they tend to be simulated with some of the movies. Despite this, the series is excellent.

"b""On the interview of Barbra Walter with Al Pacino several years ago he said that this was the favorite role of Pacino. But this film is in itself despite this proclamation. This is a story from hell to rich history with one of the biggest endings of a movie of all time! Pacino plays a refugee Cuban thug, Tony Montana, who claws and shakes (taking some lives along the way) to the top of the cocaine world in Miami with the help of his right-hand man Manny Ray (Steven Bauer). Pacino plays this part with a lot of passion and energy that has completely fueled this film from beginning to end. You can not look away from that man. Adds humanistic dimensions to Tony Montana. Show the humor, machismo, intelligence, leadership, viscera and defects of Montana. It also shows the tender side of Montana (the scene with Michelle Pfeiffer by the pool). In fact, Pacino makes you like a character that is basically a sleezeball. Now he's acting! There are memorable moments throughout this film and some are very graphic but what is probably the highlight of this film is the big shooting scene at the end; Sosa's assassins infiltrated the Montana estate to kill him because Montana had a blow to Sosa. When Montana, full of cocaine, finally turns its attention to the assassin who fights in complete disdain with a machine gun / grenade launcher. & quot; Say hello to my little friend! & quot; it is now one of those famous movie lines in the history of cinema. He shoots them away like a domino, resisting cannon shots because of cocaine in his system. This is a true & quot; boy & quot; scene. Its action is fueled by a high adrenaline of octane and Pacino plays it incredibly. His performance is so exhilarating that you want to grab a machine gun and fight alongside him. Pacino IS Scarface! The DVD features fantastic benefits such as theater trailers, production notes, cast and bio filmmakers, the creation of SCARFACE (with Pacino) and 10 outtakes of the film. The film is in letterbox format but has not improved digitally. It would have been nice to see the film improved, but it did not damage the experience of watching this film. Actually I do not really care. It's SCARFACE!""",1

"b'I bought this not noticing that this was the ""editing of the director\'s son"". I hope the director\'s son never changes another movie again! The change was something a high school kid could do on his i-mac. The scenes that were once complete end abruptly and jump, the mouths move without dialogues, horrible growls have been added to fight the scenes. . . the list goes on. I plan to resell it and wait for the original cut to be released in the United States.'",0
"b'There seems to be some confusion between Amazon reviews on this product. ""Death Mask"" is a low budget horror film with James Best (from the television program ""The Dukes of Hazzard"") in the role of Wilbur, a socially embarrassing carnival geek who feeds a frustrated love for women. Although he finds himself falling in love with Linnea Quigley, romantic feelings at least partially repaid, Wilbur becomes attached to a beautiful death mask that forces him (free him?) To become a killer. I can not say I have an objective opinion about this film - I\'m not a fan of this sort and I just got it because I went to school with a cast member - but it struck me that James Best had a real talent and I do not know whether to be impressed or saddened by the fact that he put so much in this kind of film.'",0
"b'In my short list of film titles not to be missed for 2011, the ""Elite Team: the enemy inside"" by Jose Padilha was definitely at the top of the list. I discovered Padilha for the first time with the 2002 documentary ""Bus 174"", an unforgettable true life story of a bus hijacking that had a very publicizing public in the Brazilian media. It was a harrowing picture that had much to say about contemporary journalism, rampant crime, local corruption, political maneuvers and the police state as it did for the royal event it portrayed. I think it\'s fair to say that some of these same themes have remained a constant even in all the future efforts of the director / writer / director. That said, I want to emphasize that ""Elite Squad: The Enemy Within"" is actually a sequel to the 2007 project titled ""Elite Squad"". \'\' While the two films are definitely better served as complements, this has an independent story that can be enjoyed for its merits. If you choose to see this without having seen the first image, you could lose part of the character\'s story - but the script takes you to a rather fast and efficient speed. The film revolves around the character returning from Captain Nascimento, effectively played by Wagner Moura. Moura is responsible for a special criminal unit and when a prison uprising goes wrong, the tactics and decisions of the team are questioned by human rights activists (guided in spectacular fashion by the ex-wife\'s new husband). Public opinion, however, sided with the fast acting and intransigent Moura and pushed him into a position of even greater power. Making a mission to eliminate the rampant drug crisis in Rio, he turns to the lower class slums where the problem has its strongest point of support. But by eliminating the obvious enemy, it can make room for a more unexpected nemesis. While dirty cops and unscrupulous politicians prepare for new power, Moura begins to realize that he has cut off a monster\'s head to see another (more nefarious) take his place. Unable to trust those in power, he sees new allies in the media and activists who had once been critical of Moura\'s methods. The turn-around is compelling and credible and undeniably terrifying. The film is filmed in a style of gritty documentation that makes the unpleasantness even more tangible. While perhaps the narrative is based a bit \'too much on the analysis of the voiceover, maintains the perspective of Moura in perspective while the great story leaves it in the margin for large pieces of the action. In essence, this is a morality game masquerading as a ruthless crime saga - but in that vein, it is surprisingly undervalued. Changes in character are subtle and the action is inexorably real. It is hard to imagine that the film could have a happy or satisfying conclusion, but what seemed to us to be certainly appropriate even if it does not envelop everything in a clean little bow. In the end, the characters distinguish this piece (Moura is fantastic) that has a universal relevance in its themes of corruption and those who fight it. ""Elite Squad: The Enemy Within"" is a rare image that will make you think while having fun. About 4 stars 1/2. KGHarris, 2/12.'",1

The ghost flees to Coney Island to start a circus / monster show after the events in Paris. Madame Giry and her daughter Meg follow him. Meg becomes a burlesque dancer and obsessed with the Phantom. Madame Giry wants to connect them. Christine, Raul and their son are attracted to Cony Island to open a new opera house, but the Phantom convinces Christine to sing on her show. Raul is now a villain, drunk and Christine is now in love with the Phantom, who has gone from the pathetic, dejected, dangerous genius of the original musical to someone who interprets the rules and is a meek, self-sacrificed, and loves clowns and bad Carnival music. Oh, by the way, it's revealed that Christine slept with him the night before her marriage and Gustave is actually the son of the Ghosts! Everything about this musical is SO, SO BAD.

"b""Black Sheep (no, not Chris Farley and David Spade starring in the mid-90s) is a film that must be seen to be believed. It happened in New Zealand as a sheep fetish man (Nathan Meister) returns to his old family farm to make peace with his brother (Peter Feeney) who, just like that, is genetically modifying the sheep that inhabit the earth. These sheep end up hungry for human flesh, and those that bite become monstrous sheep (yes, they were sheep), and before you know it, they are going crazy. Yes, Black Sheep seems absolutely ridiculous, and in any case it is, but the film is so enjoyable that you can not help but admire it. Not to mention the brilliant effects of gore and creatures offered by Peter Jackson's WETA workshop team, as the rookie writer / director Jonathan King casts a visual joke on you after another on piles of blood. It does not come close to Shaun of the Dead's irreverent horror / fun in itself, but for what it's worth, Black Sheep is damn funny that fans of horror comedy should definitely take a look.""",1
"b""The Bunny Works is REALLY arrived a long time since the last animated film and very much as a doctor, & quot; King and I & quot; . Now this fantastic new movie comes with wonderful and well-developed characters, a very professional animation, a lot of frenetic action that no eye can ever follow, simply a GORGEOUS art graphic and a very severe message about xenophobia and the need for respect life. It took place in the late '50s, when America was still taken by its fears of a cold war, a young boy stays alone at home watching science fiction movies while his young mother worked late into the night at the local club . Then he hears funny noises, so he goes to investigate and so he crashes against the most unlikely friend he would ever do: a towering robot capable of swallowing machines and flattening entire forest areas. Yet this mechanical monster turns into a very kind creature that is full of innocence and love. And then comes a sharp-nosed detective who is suspiciously sniffing any clues about the strange events in the small town of Maine. Poor Hogarth (what a name!) He must fight feverishly to protect the great stranger who undoubtedly feels unwelcome here on this planet. A great work of art that will win the respect of the collective public which, unfortunately, has been conditioned to consider animation as a sugar-coated fare for young children. But - this medium can be a very powerful narrator as a truly radical proof as & quot; The Iron Giant & quot; it will certainly prove it!""",1
"b""I was really excited to try Tracy Anderson's method, but when I got the Dance Cardio DVD, it was not quite as she would have said.

"b'""Destination Moon"" and ""Rocketship XM"" both came out the same year, but that\'s where the resemblance ends. I consider ""Destination Moon"" the father of the modern science fiction movie. The quality of the production and the magnificent Technicolor give this film a quality that few science fiction films of the 50s would achieve. What helps this film is the fact that there are no real protagonists, but very competent and very recognizable actors. ""Rocketship XM"" was instead a hasty film made to beat ""... Moon"" in the cinemas. The black and white print quality is beautiful, after being returned to its original clear quality. Stars of Lloyd Bridges. The special effects for `` XM \'\' were decent for their time, but the effects for `` ... Moon \'\' were ahead of their time. If I was classifying these films, I would give `` ..Moon \'\' to B + and `` XM \'\' to C +. Both films are fun and make beautiful companions.'",1

I do not care how much they dress the DVD version of this movie, it will not change the fact that it\'s terrible. I\'m just giving this star, but keep five or six Advil at your fingertips. This should be enough to cover you for this. A couple of little bits of this disaster: 1. It\'s produced by Uwe Boll, the helm of two of the worst movies I\'ve ever seen in ""House of the Dead"" and ""Alone in the Dark"" 2. In what (to me) ) was a staggering moment of brutal honesty, Boll himself admitted that he had not filmed the movie until two weeks before shooting began. What he ended up with is a bunch of ""names"" who had a hole in their program and showed up for a quick salary and a free trip to Romania. It also shows that the whole film seems to have skipped the rehearsals completely and nobody seems to be interested in making an honest effort. Will Sanderson and Michael Madsen may have discovered the only way to survive a Boll movie. They had been completely drunk throughout the production. Ben Kingsley, who had previously had to deal with Madsen in the film ""Species"", even refused to be on the same set with him.5. In the harem scene with Meatloaf, those are HONEST TO GOD, 100% FULL-BLOODED ROMAN PROSTITUTE. I swear you can not invent this stuff. Apparently, Boll could not afford real actresses (their bonding rates made them too expensive), so he decided he could cut costs simply by ordering the real thing. This is a disaster from one side to the other. I\'ll give it though, it\'s better than his last two films. \'Bloodrayne\', at least, is a little unintentionally funny. Despite having said this, I could never recommend anyone to see him. It will only encourage man to continue. Only Boll, no doubt in my mind, is the most talented filmmaker I have ever seen.

"b""I love this workout! It's a great program that takes about 45 minutes, and I can do it when I do not want to go out to the gym. I danced most of my life so most of the exercises in low-impact training are already familiar with, but the repetition is wonderful, and I'm just a little sore the next day every time I do the workout at low impact. High impact training is a different story. I did it once since I had the DVD and I was having trouble walking the next day! ! This comes from a dancer who is in excellent shape. The high impact training is mostly squat. As soon as I recover from the last time I did it, I will do it again because it's beautiful and it's so beautiful for you! There is an extra workout for arms and abs. Each set has the Cheerleaders of the Dallas Cowboys they demonstrate. Three of the cheerleaders have been selected to perform exercises for beginners, intermediate and advanced, so you can choose which one you want to follow. The only thing that does not really matter to me is that the coach who drives the training talks a lot. It's very motivating, though, and especially people who are not very familiar or motivated for training, I think they would benefit. I was hesitant to buy a training DVD because of the previous disappointment with them and the lack of motivation to do them more than a couple of times, but this DVD is an exception. It's a lot of fun, takes less than an hour from my day and I can choose exactly how intense or simple I want to take it from one day to the next. Highly recommended ! !""",1

The spectator goes out where he has arrived. Completely frustrating is the fact that the film insults the spectator's intelligence with lazy plot devices. For example, there are scenes that involve the movement of huge clanking machines, but the characters are not even aware of the machines until the machines are on top of them. Or consider that barrels of oil or gasoline, or molten metal tubes or liquid nitrogen are conveniently omnipresent so that the characters can shoot them when needed to make an explosion or melt a little car. The film is full of such devices. They perform, one after another, for about two hours. Nothing else happens. We do not learn anything new.

Kristanna Loken, best known for her warmth and TX role in Terminator 3, plays vampire heroine in this incoherent mess, which for some strange reason also includes Oscar winner Ben Kingsley in the role of the evil Kagan. The plot is the typical affair of the VS vamp humans, but the single most intriguing aspect of Bloodrayne is precisely the way Boll manages to get these actors in this film? It's amazing how Kinglsey, Michael Madsen, Michelle Rodriguez and Billy Zane ended up in this, which threw up some of the most terrible dialogues you've ever heard. Occasionally action and blood are pretty decent, but Bloodrayne prefers an involuntary comedy. Also present Matt Davis, Meat Loaf, Boll's favorite, Will Sanderson, and the brave genre Udo Kier.""",0

"b'+++++ This film is based on the musical game ""Cabaret"" (also called ""Goodbye Berlin""). The music and lyrics are of the great John Kander and Fred Ebb respectively. It was directed by, and the dance and musical numbers were staged by, the late, great Bob Fosse. Personally, I do not really like musicals but this film is much more than a formidable musical. Do not get the idea that there are only songs and dances. There is also a beautiful story that explores the corruption, decadence and false dreams of Berlin in the early thirties when Hitler was coming to power. The story follows the life of Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) during this turbulent period. She is the so-called disco star Kit Kat who has a mischievous master of ceremonies (Joel Gray). The writer Brian Roberts (Michael York) intrudes into the world of Sally, hoping to take the free room in front of his. He soon discovers that she is a ball of fire and energy. He tells us about his dream: ""I will be a big movie star, I mean, if alcohol and sex do not take me before."" The film alternates between real life and hard outside the Kit Kat nightclub and the carefree life inside , where those who participate can forget their problems and difficult moments. The song and the choreography inside the Kit Kat Klub provide a counterpoint to the drama of real life on the outside. Five tracks from the original Broadway production have not entered the movie as ""performed"", but appear as background music. The music, the costumes, the choreography and the acting are all exquisite. Particularly impressive is the performance of Minnelli, fantastic on stage and just as convincing. The combination with her is the fascinating interpretation of Gray as the Master of Ceremonies that injects humor and pathos, as well as the effervescence and solidity in the process. The last scene of singing and dance performed by Minnelli is historical and unforgettable! This film won eight Academy Awards including Best Actress (Minnelli), Best Supporting Actor (Gray) and Best Director (Fosse). Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2003) is perfect for image quality and sound. It has a long list of interesting extras. In conclusion, I would advise you to go to this cabaret (old friend). You\'ll never want to leave! ! (1972; 2 hours; wide screen; 32 scenes) +++++'",1
"b""Put me to use. This is what the so-called Ritchie Boys asked the United States Army in World War II and got what they wanted. These new recruits, alien refugees, some of whom just landed from Europe, were sent to Camp Ritchie to find out how the German army did its duty so that they could interrogate prisoners in war zones. It's a World War II story that has not yet been told, and Ritchie Boys themselves behave to look enthralling and a wonderful story. These are soldiers to whom most of us can refer, people who were not so good at handling firearms, but who in their work fascinated, confused and terrified the prisoners of war who appeared and had information they wanted . This is an excellent addition to the growing sub-genres of Jewish documentaries and World War II, and the wise use of sport with interviews, music and archival footage.

I consider GWLTT as a breath of fresh air for a sector that seems to need it.

Personal note: in the 70s I met the late Budd Boetticher as a friend. We rode to the Griffith Park on his Andalusian and made several trips to Mexico, where he still practiced his dangerous and beloved profession of fighting bulls on horseback. In life and in movies, he seemed obsessed with the role of a male antagonist in constant conflict with his surroundings. Boetticher preceded director Sam Peckinpah in themes that made the latter famous. Boetticher was the real thing. It\'s nice to see this early gem available on DVD.

"b'Stereotyped characters, convoluted logic and an abundant lack of intelligence can be found in & quot; Domestic Disturbance, & quot; a thriller that wants to be bad, but ends up playing well. What starts out as a rather interesting film spills over into an endless chasm of amazing twists and aggravating characters that make all the wrong choices. Here\'s a film that covers familiar terrain, but it can not raise much interest once things go wrong. John Travolta plays the role of Frank Morrison, a boat builder whose ex-wife Susan (Teri Polo) is about to remarry. This, of course, is unacceptable for their 12-year-old son, Danny (Matthew O\'Leary), whose explosions against his parents\' divorce have led to being picked up by the police station on numerous occasions. Like any good father, Frank advises Danny to accept what he can not change, and to give his new stepfather, the rich and popular Rick Barnes (Vince Vaughn), a warm welcome. Now anyone who knows their thrillers can guess that if there is money involved, then there is usually a contaminated past here and there; this film is no exception. The marriage takes place smoothly, despite the presence of Ray Coleman (Steve Buscemi), a former acquaintance of Rick\'s who is preparing to collect a large sum of money from his old friend. One thing leads to another, the mechanisms appear and Rick has a murder on his hands, unaware that Danny has witnessed the action from the back seat of the car in which it occurred. This is the first of a series of scenes that seem promising, but keep little intensity or surprise. Judging by Danny\'s "" Boy who wept wolf & quot; syndrome, it is easy to predict that no one will believe him when he reveals what he has seen, except Frank, who must harbor a grudge against his son\'s assailant if there must be any action or energy in the story. There\'s a bit of cat and mouse going on, while Frank looks for the missing beam and possible clues to take to the police, but he\'s hardly going anywhere. The film seems more interested in showing us how stupid people can be in such situations, however incredible they may be. From the beginning, Susan stands next to her man, defending him from Danny\'s accusations. Do you ever think that when a strange event happens, Rick left home at the same time? Do you ever stop to think about how his disbelief in his son\'s affirmations is influencing him, rather than the old song-and-dance about his marriage to Rick? Even the police are completely in the dark, ignoring everything until the end when it does not matter. My big complaint with & quot; Domestic Disturbance & quot; is his editor, who cut the film just 88 minutes, too short for a thriller and too long for a documentary about the vengeful stepfathers. The Paramount advertising campaign for the film hit us with a series of pre-release television commercials, as well as a long and revealing theatrical trailer. There are scenes in both of these, one of which implies a car chase, the other involving a discussion between Rick and Frank in which Rick tries to buy it. These and other glimpses are not even included in the final cut and maybe they may have been more interesting than what we see here. The culmination is standard forage, but has the ability to generate more intensity overall than the rest of the film. Travolta turns into a good performance, convincing us of his status as a loving father; Vaughn fails to generate a sense of threat, while Polo does little else if not completely devoid of ideas. For all its attributes (which are few), & quot; Domestic Disturbance & quot; he adds nothing new to a consummate kind; his lack of a lucid plot could be overlooked except for his inability to generate any level of suspense. Note: The film was shot on the East Coast of North Carolina, in Southport, and yet in one scene, Ray mentions his position where Rick was from a childhood memory of Rick about a family vacation in Maryland.

"b'I love a good movie about vampires whether it\'s scary like ""Nosferatu"" or campy like ""The Lost Boys"". Unfortunately I can not say the same for ""Bloodrayne"", which is neither scary nor campy. What I did not like most about this turkey of a movie was the way it was changed. There was no real beginning. Everything that the viewer discovers of Rayne (Kristanna Loken) goes through a series of annoying flashbacks. I can not believe that the Oscar winner Ben Kingsley was tied to this horrible film, at least ""Species"" was actually scary, disgusting and yet fun. ""Bloodrayne"" is neither one nor the other. Until now I never thought a love scene could be so funny (unintentionally) until I saw Rayne and Sebastian wearing it. It was so bad that it was fun. Although the two Underworld films offer nothing substantial, at least those films were fun, ""Bloodrayne"" was not. Bad acting, bad writing, bad everything. Apparently Hollywood has not learned from the disasters of the past that video games do not make good films (ie ""Super Mario Bros."" and ""Mortal Kombat"").'",0

"b""I love this film, but the biggest problem I have is with proportions. I recently bought the film, not realizing that it had been cut to 1.33: 1 by 1.85: 1, and at the end I feel like I have to pay a movie, I should own the whole thing. Shame on me for not reviewing the proportions before the purchase, but in addition to this, it's a great movie minus the dribbling of Coppola in the middle.""",0
"b""He is a clear teacher and the exercises are presented at the right pace. It takes time to explain the logic behind the practice, which seems like a good idea to tell those of us who learn exclusively through DVDs. The two songs you learn here, a classic, a bossa nova, are nice tracks, and its teaching rhythm here is a little faster. In short, it provides much information beyond what one could imagine. There are two problems with the DVD. First, as with other DVDs of this publisher, you're paying almost thirty dollars for sixty minutes of DVD. Traum is also a good teacher, but these seem to me too expensive. There are other better offers and similar free information on the web, so I'm not completely satisfied with it. The second problem is that fingerstyle exercises are rather elementary. I use everyday game patterns that are more intricate than the ones he gives, and so these seemed simple to me (I will certainly do them anyway) and I had worked harder for myself. The only exercise that seemed to me intermediate are the arpeggios, in third and second position, which concern more the left hand than the technique of the right hand. The two songs, however, are beyond the beginner, more intermediate. It seems to me that most buyers will be disappointed by one or other half of this 60-minute DVD: bored as I was with the basic level of the exercises or intimidated by the complexity of the tracks. What I would have preferred are 60 minutes of exercises, increasingly complex. I suppose the average buyer would find it too boring (teach me songs!), But I'm very interested in improving and learning from learning other tools that repetitive exercises are the way to do it. I wanted a DVD guide for these rather than a printed book of fat of them, and this is not exactly what I was hoping for. As pointed out, you could also use a plectrum with these exercises to work on your right hand accuracy""",1
"b""Armand Assante is one of my favorites. I loved all his films. I was so surprised to see him in a doo-wap role, but it was amazing as always. His emotional performance of a man who lost his wife to cancer and is now facing the potential loss of his daughter from the same illness is excruciating. His relationship with his two sons also brings reality to the love of parents for his children and the torment of his singing career. He and his group of singers of the '50s made a great success, but they were soon removed from the limelight. For the next 30 years, he works as a bartender and his group plays for weddings. If you love doo-wap and Assante, you will love this movie. Nostalgia at its best. I recommend taking the audio CD and playing it before watching the movie, so you'll really like it.""",1
"b""For the big fans of Manhunter, I would advise you to avoid this DVD if you plan to own ... What was announced as & quot; Theatrical & quot; the version is actually an unrelated version that awkwardly modifies two scenes that were released in theaters, including one of the key scenes, and yet has some of the most mundane footage restored from the cutting room floor. These cuts are bad and do not make sense to them, since they do not represent the theatrical output and destroy the momentum of what had been a finely-edited film. I do not know if it was ignorance or arrogance, but this is the worst hacking job I've ever seen trying to pass by product. Whoever was in charge of this in Anchor Bay was an idiot and if I were Michael Mann, I would call my lawyers. The & quot; Director's Cut & quot; it's even worse as it includes the & quot; Not theatrical & quot; release And the so-called & quot; Director's Cut & quot; - a collection of some interesting and not so interesting pieces. As a companion to a real theatrical output, this would have been a fascinating addition; But here again, Anchor Bay finds a way to ruin what should be a good product. The entire film that was not put into post-production video is stained and blurred, as if it had been transferred from a VHS tape - and one worn. - Simply amazing that anyone can have the audacity to offer this kind of cheapness for hard earned money. I saw this film when it first came out in the theater and I considered it one of the best of that year; and I rushed to buy the LaserDisc version when it came out. When the Director's Cut DVD was released this year by Anchor Bay, I was on the waiting list, ready to welcome the improved version of the THX widescreen. Being intimately aware of the film, imagine my disappointment. Do not waste time. Wait until a better version comes out. To make these people want to compare Silence of the Lambs with Manhunter, they usually prefer one another and their minds are practically invented at this point. I'm exactly in the field of Manhunter. As far as I'm concerned, I liked Silence, but I could never take it seriously since I found Lector's line both incredibly superhuman and therefore unrealistic and unsuspecting. However, the Reader of Manhunter is a chilling but more realistic picture that amazes me every time I see it in the way that an evil genius manages to manipulate events outside his cell through the simple device of a telephone. This Lector is safe behind the sterilized bars - yet it still manages to be a forced presence to deal with. I hope every fan and future fan of Manhunter can see it the way it came out, a beautiful piece of crafts that was thin and marginal, yet elegantly flowing. Siskel and Ebert rated him one of the best films of all time, years after he came out. But for now, I will keep my LaserDisc.""",0
"b""One of the funniest films of the '80s is Big, in which Tom Hanks ... well, you already know it. I loved almost everything about this set of 2 discs. However, a great gotcha. Or maybe two, depending on how you look at it. If you play Extended Cut (Disc 1) with the Commentary set to On, you get a) no comment, and b) a soundtrack in Spanish. If you play the Theatrical version with Comment set to On, you get essentially nothing but comment. It is not possible to hear any dialogue from the film, as far as I know. Reproduction of theatrical or extended versions with Commentary set to Off is fine. The Extras disk is nice, but the defects mentioned above should really be addressed.""",1
"b'It\'s my fault if I had higher expectations on this film, but I guess this movie was not made for guys like me. The acting is ok, the character of Matthew McConaughey, Ben and Kate Hudson, Andie just have to act and react. Dialogue does not matter. The character of Kate Hudson always has the upper hand, which is fine for a while, but after an hour it becomes tiring. She completely invades every aspect of Ben\'s life; we never see Andie\'s world apart from his two friends and the workplace. So, while both characters have a similar program, there is a total imbalance between the top hands, and this for me is the biggest flaw in the film. He endures all his attempts to ""lose him"", but all of this only produces frustration in Andie - and pushes her to do more crazy things. As a spectator you are dying to see her fall on her face only once. But this is wishful thinking. Ben\'s ability to recover from Andie\'s antics hardly intrigues me, and Andie\'s total lack of shame does not go along with me. Of course they both look great, and Hudson smiles positively when he smiles, but man, 112 minutes is a long time to endure this game. I can imagine that some people think this film is fantastic. Girl Power and everything. I do not know . But I think we can agree that the film was conceived as a vehicle for Kate Hudson\'s rise to fame. This film reminds me a little WHAT WOMEN WANT (with Mel Gibson) for a number of reasons, but mainly because it was written and produced by women - that in the world of men\'s cinema is a much-needed perspective - but Nancy Myers ( the producer / director of What Women Want) is definitely smarter than the ""brain"" of How to Lose A Guy in 10 Days. You just have to look at the DVD extras to see the proof. We meet two of the producers, both of whom obviously have a facelift. I\'m serious . It\'s disturbing . They talk about the material as if it were Shakespeare. Then there is the director Donald Petrie, who totally lacks any charisma. The fact of being with him is so cheap that it\'s probably more fun to watch than most of the movie. While sitting there chatting, a TV monitor behind him shoots still images from the film, and a clerk (with her back to the camera) stares at a static PC screen as she bites her nails and shakes her head a lot. He does it for the duration of the interviews with Petrie. Oh, and did I mention the background music that accompanies the extras? It\'s the music of department stores. Or lift music. Which one you hate the most. I did not care about the comment. Donald is boring. There are no outtakes, which is now unusual for a comedy. The deleted scenes are actually good, some honest emotions are shown by Andie and we get some more calm and private moments between the two protagonists. Look, everything started ok. It looked like a harmless and harmless romantic comedy, but the love story lasted about 10 minutes. I can summarize my review with this observation of the reason of the director Petrie who is interested in directing the film. He says it was because he discovered that Kate Hudson was connected to it. Aha. So basically, if the film is good at the box office, then it will launch Hudson AND\'s career. Sorry Petrie, but it\'s not good enough for me.'",0
"b""As a fan of the Hellsing series I can not honestly say that this series is worthy of being seen. There's no real reason to watch this series when Hellsing Ultimate is clearly superior work. While Alucard is badass if you look at the latest Hellsing OV and compare them with the manga series, you'll see that Hellsing's Last Lives are the perfectly animated version of the manga. So do not waste your money on the series of impure souls as if it had nothing to do with the manga and two is not even finished. Hellsing Ultimate is the only real way to enjoy Hellsing's animation.""",0
"b""McLintock is a great comedy / western; the casting is perfect and the screenplay is intelligent and witty. However, Good Times Video has badly treated this excellent movie with huge disrespect and scammed buyers of this DVD. The ancient Greek saying of & quot; caveat emptor & quot; or & quot; pay attention to the buyer & quot; It fits well here. Whenever you see that the DVD comes from Good Times Video I strongly recommend that you pass the purchase of that article. We hope that a REAL version of McLintock will soon be distributed by John Wayne's estate. This film was not a favorite of John Wayne and was released late for such a beautiful film. I hope this has nothing to do with Mr. Wayne's estate in releasing a clear version (and letter box).""",0
"b""This is the romantic comedy with which all the other romantic comedies are judged. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan have an undeniable chemistry and top-notch timing. And surprisingly also Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher who have really great moments that add fun to the film. This film knows that nobody knows how to present Manhattan better than Woody Allen and takes heavily on borrowing its traditions. Including the choice of romantic pop standards. As in Annie Hall, & quot; It had to be you & quot; it is the musical fulcrum for an inevitable coupling. The dialogue is snappy and rhythmic with an ear for the sensitivity of New York. And he also knows how to show off his favorite New York haunts. Even Billy Crystal is a bit hazy. Still this film is an original and his style has been imitated countless times by other films in hopes of capturing some of his magic. Nobody still exceeds it. The icing on the cake was the marvelous choice to interrupt the past seasons of the relationship between Harry and Sally and the old couple who told stories of their first meeting. The way they speak and take hold of the events is fascinating and authentic and compels a smile of recognition. When Harry Met Sally is a carefree and very funny film that never gets boring, it does not matter how many times it appears. It's a classic. The DVD contains about 7 minutes of additional deleted movies. In this case it is quite clear why it was canceled. Look at your risk. Rob Reiner's audio comment appears to have been delivered under threat. Do not look for anecdotes or joyful insights on where he found all these great ideas. The comment track is rather slow and dry. The & quot; Creation of & quot; the documentary is a bit more fun and perceptive, so the extras are not a total wash. The quality of the sound and the image are at the same time bright and lush, so the most important part of the album, the film, is as pleasant as possible. When Harry Met Sally has a lot of fun with men and women trying to understand each other and make us laugh a lot and even just cry a little bit in the process.""",1
"b'MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR must be one of the most intense action films ever made. There is very little that I could add to this already popular film. Both fans and critics are unanimous in their praise for what is the BEST chapter of the MAD MAX trilogy. That said, it\'s also EXTREMELY sad to see the kind of DVD treatment that received this highly innovative film. Unlike the special edition of the DVD MAD MAX, this is austere at best: a mix and subtitles dolby 5.1 ""passable"". That\'s all . Image quality is only slightly ""acceptable"" (dark scenes are highly pixelated and difficult to understand!). No director\'s comment, nothing behind the scenes, nothing at all. For a film that is praised as LANDMARK in science fiction and advertised as influential as STAR WARS, the DVD that is available is a shame to cry. Because no one has ever bothered to release a special edition goes beyond my showdown. We see so much `` trash \'\' released as `` special edition \'\' and yet we still have to wait for a defective DVD of MAD MAX 2. My review, as you may have guessed, is about this most serious crime. I know MAD MAX 2 with an 11 (yes, it\'s a VERY funny movie) but the DVD is really smelly. We hope that Mr. Miller will regain his senses and release a worthy DVD package for the film that most likely will be remembered by!'",1

I did not come out of this tape but, at the same time, I could not follow them. They pass from one step to the next, as if we tried every step with them for six weeks before the tape was rolled. I was totally uncoordinated. They were taking a step, then another and another, and I was still trying to understand the first step. By doing this training I felt like a chicken with a severed head.

"b'I do not understand what constitutes a comedy these days. Here is another ""comedy"" that is not fun and focuses too much on the same tired lines, mostly related to sexuality, without trying to develop any kind of plot. The acting is insignificant, the screenplay is below average and the direction seems uninspired. What a winner! Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy interpret the bride and groom who at the beginning of the film are returning from what was clearly not a big honeymoon. They behave like children, running at each other in the walls and throwing rubber into each other\'s hair. Let\'s go back to their meeting (Kutcher hits her in the face with a soccer ball) and the next romance. He is a reporter of the cemetery traffic for a radio station, while he has had all the education possible and is a passionate lover of art. The honeymoon is in Europe. Now you should understand what will be some jokes. How about trying to connect something from America to the wall when the plugs do not fit and the power is twice as strong? ... Ha Ha. Then there are the jokes about European hygiene, with huge bugs that crawl on our heroes when they are in the next hotel. Driving in Europe? So you have to take one of those European sized currency cars that may not be a worse shade of yellow. Oh, and no more points to guess that an old Murphy flame will show up and try to take it away. All in all, this film is bad. It\'s not the worst thing I\'ve ever seen, which is why it has two stars instead of one. But this is a completely brainless narrative, we have already seen it before.

A scene `` all is lost '' and `` soon chango '' in the next everything is solved. This leaves the main characters as cardboard cutouts for a comic plot. It's still worth looking for the elegant BBC invitations, modern London and some fun scenes. Richardson is incredibly charming and Laurie is charming and wonderful. Laurie's sperm song is a keeper. Just do not expect that touching moment to make everything work - someone, somewhere, somehow forgot to write, shoot or include it in this version. But, I'd like to see the version of Region 2!

"b""Like a movie, the Count of Montecristo is fun alone, but compared to the book it's horrible. There are several cases in which Hollywood has had its way with the plot. The revelation of who the real father Alberts is the worst. This did not happen in the book. The film lacks the style of the book. The count was much more subtle and sneaky in the book and never bent to take his hands himself.

At the same time, questions are raised that surround the motives behind the missionary work. They should be inspired by God's love, but other aspirations have been the impetus for many throughout history. Just like in the Crusades, there were some very good Christians, but there were also many killed and conquered in the name of a loving God. This exemplary historical film will provoke thoughts and will leave the spectators enriched!""",1

I had years of ballet training, I\'m in good shape and, compared to Gwenyth\'s life choices, so I bought the DVD. The method can be effective, but you must be able to learn the routines. It would have helped the presentation and would have been more professional to have presented the steps by name (French, eg Glisade, jete or English, eg slide, change). So, after allowing the students to shoot it down with their backs to them [something that TA does], it would have been fun and effective if every routine had been set to music while the students ""ran"" up to speed. Instead, all 8 routines are presented first - each seen from the front, from the back - slowly, quickly - and without music. The beginning of the DVD (trying to learn routines) seems like practicing rhythmic gymnastics slowly while a coach counts from 1 to 8 repeatedly: it\'s boring and does not seem to dance.

"b'This is not a review of the quality of the DVD, the cinematography, the acting, etc., but rather the essential element of what I consider the smartest movie of the year, even if it is not illegal. * Spoiler alert * From what I have read, it seems that most of these reviewers have not grasped the ambiguity of the finale or, if they did, found it too implausible. The previous group (most of the cinephiles), not realizing the ambiguity if he had done it or not, seemed to miss that the last line referred to the conversation with the director, the philosophical knot of the film, in which case Leo is resisting the acceptance that is the nature of man to be violent. If nothing else, the last line suggests that if he really did what he says, he has at least a certain level of self-knowledge about it, he is carefully watching his madness and refusal to live with it. Or it could be the case that he was always sane, that he was really right about what was happening and refused to accept their suggested memories and the watchman\'s vision, but realizing that he could never escape and therefore decided to die a hero \'. As for what some have said, that this last premise is too incredible, I do not agree. Why is it so hard to believe that a country would be incapable of something like that? During the period of time this movie takes place, most of the United States was still sterilizing the mental and physical handicapped. Would it be such a big moral step to go from this to experimenting with psychotic criminals, people without a future, for the sake of our national security, our way of life, our dominance in world affairs? Of course, there are problems in taking this interpretation of the film\'s ending. It would be highly accidental if the four names were really anagrams of themselves. She has dreams for the whole film that allude to the finale, before the explanation had ever been suggested by the doctor (although I looked at it only once and could miss something) On the other hand, if Leo had really made a hallucination in the scene in the cave with Rachel, so why was there a total lack of surrealism, unlike all the other sequences of the genre? The practical answer, to convince the public to the end, is not credible. The contradictions here seem to derive from the fact that Scorsese is revisiting the same theme that explored right at the end of the ""King of comedy"", and in the same style: we left to guess if it really happened or if it\'s all in the character\'s mind. I did not read the book, but from what I understood, Scorsese added a layer not present in the work of Lehane, where it is certainly all in the mind of the character, similar to ""the Machinist"" (not to knock on Lehane: with his psychological depth and the misanthropic grasp of human nature, he is the heir of the great Clouzot - though probably most successfully in ""Mystic River""). Adding ambiguity to the end without modifying some plot points for the startup, gaps in the logic arise. If this had been cleaned up a bit, I would not hesitate to classify ""YES"" with ""Raging Bull"" and ""Taxi Driver"". Even so, this is still one of the best.'",1

"b'I\'ve been an X-Men fan since I was about 9 years old. In recent years, comics have become stale and almost impossible to follow (a situation that Marvel Comics has changed lately), and although I gave the first X-Men film more than a chance, I did not think about it much. So I tried to keep my expectations for X-2 low ... The good news is that it\'s MUCH better than its predecessor! X-2 does not need to bomb viewers with as much information (since most of it was edited in the first film), and can practically go well. We pick up where the first film was interrupted: Magneto is in prison, Wolverine is looking for clues to his past, and anti-mutant hysteria is spreading. Enter William Stryker, a fanatical government employee mutant-hate, excellently played by Brian Cox. Send Blue-skinned mutant Nightcrawler to tear the White House up and irritate the President in the impressive opening sequence, guaranteeing presidential cooperation with the anti-mutant agenda. Stryker wastes no time creating a team of secret forces strikes, and their first goal is ... the school of Professor Xavier. It seems they have chosen the wrong time to visit, though; Children are home alone with their ""Babysitter"" ... ... Wolverine! Let\'s get ready for RUMMMMBBLLEEEE! ! ! Before you know it, it\'s a total war between Stryker and the mutant mutation faction; Magneto is extracted from the prison, Xavier and Cyclops are captured and used by Stryker, and the stage is set for a victorious brawl at all the rest at Alkali Lake, where Wolvie could uncover some interesting trivia about his skeleton and Adamantium\'s claws. ... Fans disappointed by the lack of action in the first film will be in their glory here, as the number of fights has been accelerated, including an excellent launch between Wolverne and Deathstrike, played by the adorable Kelly Hu, and the furious berserker of Wolverine in the villa. I like the way he sends Stryker\'s henchmen ...! Director Bryan Singer has assembled an excellent cast, and each character has his moment to shine. The new additions, Cox and Hu, do a great job with their respective roles, and the end prepares the ground for X-3. Longtime fans will appreciate the appearances of X-Men pillars like The Beast, Colossus, Siryn, Artie and Kitty Pryde, and will be looking for mentions of Gambit and Franklin Richards, among others. Bad news ... ? The film starts strong but becomes a bit weak towards the end; Perhaps a closer fitting was necessary. Moreover, considering how much the film is based on characters and situations developed by the X-Men comic scribe Chris Claremont, including the plot that raised the entire fabric from his legendary graphic novel ""God Loves, Man Kills"", I was more than a little disconcerted not to see him recognized in the credits. X-2 is not a perfect movie, but it\'s a BIG step forward from the previous X-Men movie, and it\'s a great way to start the summer movie season.'",1

"b""This is not a review of the film, but of Bluray herself. If you're in this new wave of Japanese splatter movies, you know what to expect, and Tokyo Gore Police is among the best of its kind. However, Media Blasters dropped the ball with this version. Or rather, someone in their art department is simply incredibly lazy. The back cover has been copied and pasted from their 2-disc DVD edition. This version of Bluray is ONE disk, not two. Furthermore, the bonus material in the list (TGP short films, behind the scenes) is not on the record. What you get is a trailer for the film and for the other Tokyo Shock releases. The transfer is expected in the media (these low-cost shots and the quickly rendered features will not shine), and there are DTS-HD 5.1 audio tracks both in Japanese and in Deceiving the mind that this type of oversights occur in this day and age .

"b""I agree with the first guy. This package was not exceptional. I bought it hoping to see some real combat footage (or any other footage for that matter) taken by the Vietnam War. instead, any VHS that is supposed to specifically target a US combative aspect in Vietnam (ie marines, bombers, navy, helicopters, etc.) always shows the same footage again and again.

"b'So ""Ally McBeal"" ended forever, even though this collection of episodes reminds us what we care about. Focusing on Ally (Flockhart) perpetually single, slender and extravagant, the audience is attracted by his hallucinations (brilliantly realized thanks to an impressive computer animation), his loves, his losses and his work at a law firm that seems to embrace the strange. What made this show great was that it was so different, with the sharp writing of David E. Kelley that it brought a mixture of well-positioned observations on modern relationships and absolutely fun characters. Who could forget John Cage (McNicol), the diminutive lawyer with a pet frog and an infatuation with Barry White? Add to this Richard Fish, who seems to be basking in his own male chauvanism, \'Subzero\' Nelle (diRossi) and the delightful Ling (Liu) and you have a hot cast that\'s a lot of fun whatever you\'re doing. recent episodes have been shut down for not being amusing enough and this may seem unfair, although there is always a tendency to be nostalgic about the older episodes that are offered here. Libra funny, romantic and sad very well and these first episodes were really revolutionary, paving the way for other more experimental shows. However, it would be nice to see the seasons in their entirety, as they are available in the United Kingdom.'",1
"b""Down Argentine Way is a delightful and light musical type from the early 1940s that should enchant anyone who loves this type of film. We receive great performances from great stars including Betty Grable, Don Ameche, Carmen Miranda and the incredible dancer Nicholas Brothers! The plot moves at a good pace and the acting is quite convincing. The action begins when once again the horse lover Glenda Crawford (Betty Grable) and her mother Binnie Crawford (Charlotte Greenwood) are on track. It seems that the Crawford family has always loved horses and they run too. Glenda sees a beautiful racehorse and wants to buy the horse - the trouble is, however, that the horse belongs to Don Diego Quintana (Henry Stephenson), who feeds a long and a little silly personal rancor against Willis Crawford, the patriarch of the Crawford family. However, Glenda and Binnie go to Argentina after their first attempt to buy horses from Quintana did not go very well. It is not long before Glenda falls in love with the son of Quintana, Ricardo Quintana (Don Ameche), fascinated by Glenda. The young couple tries to pass Glenda Crawford to Don Quintana in the role of Glenda Cunningham in the hope that he will like it and then does not care if it is a Crawford; but this too has its complications. In the meantime there is a horse bred for racing - Don Quintana will never let the horses run? It's a fragile subplot, but the few horse races we see in this film improve the action; and all is well with me! Look for some excellent songs and dance numbers - remember, these plots were just about no excuse for the studio to film fabulous song numbers and dances. It is said that after the audience first saw The Nicholas Brothers dance, they applauded so much that the projectionist had to rewind the film to show the scene again! Charlotte Greenwood also scored a great success with her incredible ability to kick her legs high while dancing happily in another issue. Even Betty Grable dances very well. Furthermore, this film marks the film debut of Carmen Miranda; sings a couple of songs during the film and a short song at the beginning of the film. Carmen shines even when they do not play it like they did in subsequent films! The DVD has a superlative extra on the life and times of Betty Grable. She really looked like a particularly sweet girl who did not really want too much of her life and enjoyed her private family life to the best of her ability. The quality of still photos in the Betty Grable extra is excellent. There is also a commentary running but optional for people who want to know what happened behind the scenes while this film was shot. Great ! Overall, Down Argentine Way is a musical that is worth seeing. I usually reserve five stars for a musical MGM; but this time Fox did it really well! Classic movie musical fans can not afford to miss this!""",1

This DVD contains 2 captivating episodes: Episode 1 - Fear of Flying, helps children respond to their fears and teach them that making fun of others is not a good thing to do.

"b""The review you see above, Amazon's review, I have to say, is a lot of shit. I just saw the film today, and I went to see this film with pretty low expectations, expecting an economic thrill to be above the gun battle and a story of a six-year-old could write in 5 minutes. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the first fight scene to see that there was indeed a story, and contrary to what I thought, it was surprisingly deep and very well done. The review above, Amazon's review has caught my attention by stating that the fight scene was stupid because the fight had been stimulated by a puppy. And if I had not seen the film, I would probably have agreed that arguing over a puppy is a rather stupid story, however, if you look at the scene, it's actually quite moving, hearing the dogs killed and rather than introducing a vision of an innocent puppy that he approaches a cold-blooded killer and shuffles something inside the clergy. I could go on for longer, however, I will not, I will end this review by saying that this is a cinematic magic of the highest quality. Action scenes to tell, a story that will make you think you are grateful for the emotions and an ending that will really make you smile from ear to ear. If you want to spend your money well, you will be wise to spend it on a film of this caliber.""",1
"b""I was disappointed with this DVD. I have a dance background and was able to gather all the routines pretty quickly. Those without a dance background are ready for a big challenge (but it's feasible if you're diligent and patient with yourself). Make sure you have ample space to do it - It will not really work for condominium life if you have neighbors below you and you're jumping up and down. My other criticism is that during the warming of the cardio, Tracy changes what he is doing and does not report enough what he is doing. For example, you're stretching the hamstrings with a dangling head (so you can not watch TV), you're in that pose for a while, then you look up and Tracy is doing something else ... What's the? ? ? He did not even say he was going forward. I feel like he's not very good with details. I also noticed it on his Mat DVD (very frustrating on that DVD). Also, I do not think it's very motivating or enthusiastic. It is rather introverted in making these DVDs. I was thinking it might be like Jillian from The Biggest Loser ... Maybe I'll check Jillian's Shred DVD. I've sold both my Tracy Anderson DVDs on eBay for the last time and got my full price.""",0

"b'It seems that no other Broadway musical has ever been transferred so intact on screen with every facet of its gleaming and gloriously theatrical production in its staging. River City, Iowa obviously does not seem more realistic than the Land of Oz, but that\'s how it should be. It\'s satire, and fortunately the director Morton DaCosta keeps everything in perfect shape, kept to sound exactly like on the stage, even compared to the opening number aboard a train where all the sellers sing of a certain rascal posing as a music professor. The music of Mithith Willson has never been so beautiful and is rewarded by ROBERT PRESTON, SHIRLEY JONES, PAUL FORD and HERMIONE GINGOLD in the leads, all helped and assisted by some of the best singing and dancing you could ask in a musical of this kind. Gingold is outrageously funny and Paul Ford as her husband, the mayor of River City, is equally noisy in a comic role. But it\'s Preston\'s show from start to finish with co-star Shirley Jones in excellent vocal form as the skeptical librarian. One of the most skillfully performed numbers is the ""Marian, The Librarian"" issue that takes place in the municipal library where sliding piles and balconies become part of a complex dance routine. All musical numbers are interpreted with professional charm by a talented group of actors / singers / dancers who are part of the citizenship of River City. The little Ron Howard, the boy with the forge, who later became famous for directing, is one of the protagonists as Jones\'s little brother. Success: exceptional old-fashioned musical with the heart in the right place - Americana in the best tradition of the word. Improve: it has more charm than allowed by law.'",1

This is a very accurate picture of the moons of that time and place, up to the rickety converted chicken coop that had their speeches, the cult member who has always been following you, the ""choo choo yay pow"" acclamation. (Yes, they really used it!) Forced conformity, the famous game of dodging with singing. Mortally precise.

"b'To be honest, I watched the movie because of the talent behind it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with virtually every aspect of this film. There are times when the action bounces back and forth between two series of characters and situations (at La Fifth Element) but there is little or no connection between the two situations, which makes me dizzy and confuse instead of having fun or stimulate. There is an extreme development of the character, like the many times we see Peggy (Laura Dern) slip out to get a pinch from her flask or pour herself a drink. The idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bhis alocholism is pounded in my conscience to the point of annoyance, and then I discovered that the fact that she has a substance abuse problem has nothing to do with the plot, the interaction between the characters or any another thing for that matter. Why did Robert Altman make it such a big deal then? Filler? The Kennedy family obsession with Connie (the character of Tara Reid) is another case where a lot of time is spent trying to show us this side of the character and never following any tangible ends later on in the movie . Strangely enough, it is probably one of the most ""normal"" women in the picture. All this would have led to a mediocre film but the ending really killed him for me. I have no idea what the ending means. In fact, it reinforces the idea that the whole plot was drawn from the writers who completed several pages of Mad Libs and then modified them in a script. There is really no other explanation as to why so many aspects of the film seem to be so random (or random at best).'",0
"b'Alice in Wonderland is the story of a child lost in a meaningless land. A land of NONSENSE! This film has very few nonsense. It looks more like a Harry Potter movie than Alice in Wonderland.

"b""They are disgusting of any film or game that is historical, and this certainly fits the age when women had few rights. Sometimes we need to look back on history to see how we have progressed since those times. Women have come a long way towards their independence and the right to live their lives in their own way. I would suggest to parents to let their children know how lucky they are to be able to choose the man you would like to marry, not what was good for the family. Marriages were organized and most marriages were considered only biblical roommates. Men have always had to deal with their mistress when his wife was not available (pregnant) and if they were kicked out of their wives' bed and considered in the dog house. The film really represented how little control women had on their future. Now, about the movie ... it's the true story of this duchess and her life. I thank that someone out there has put together a real historical piece like the Duchess. I would recommend everyone to see this film and know how lucky we are today to make our choices in life, both for good and for bad.""",1

I avoided buying the previous version of ""import"" because of explicit consumer complaints about the quality of the transfer. My potential concerns regarding sound and image quality have been mitigated by the vision of this new version of the United States. It seems and looks good enough, bearing in mind the source material. The visual style of the film is thin, simple and high-contrast - made with the aesthetic of ""vague America"" \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bby Lynch. The image maintains its integrity and the deep black employees do not suffer from noise often seen in older or poor transfers; the colors are also solid for a DVD. The sound design is appropriately moody, ambient, dark, evocative, provocative and intersperses a mix of quite eclectic songs with the precious contribution of the composer Angelo Badalamenti. There may be a slightly irritating volume difference between the quasi-whisper of Patricia Arquette and, for example, Rammstein - but this is not a rare problem with DVDs. Otherwise it seems rather interesting. I\'m not going to review the film, but I will say that the complete lack of special features is more forgivable for such an unusual, ambiguous and artistic film like Lost Highway than any other film that I can think of right now. I tend to see this film in the way I see abstract art: the explanation is not only unjustified, but also largely undesirable. In other words, the special features might be intriguing, but I miss them almost for a movie like Lost Highway.'",1

"b'The Golden Army: an army made to control humanity because humanity has a problem consuming everything around it. Of elven thought and goblin design, he has the power to do things that only the desperate - or crazy - would like. The elven type understood it, divided their toy and made the army rust. Unfortunately for humanity, rust is an arbitrary word and the Golden Army is something that has never stopped being a threat. And when the powerplay starts to emerge, the BPRDs are the only ones out there that have the ability to stop it. When I heard the basic material for the film, I learned that the director / Migola knew what they were doing, but it scared me a little. I say this because Hellboy II is creatively based on a novelization between Christopher Golden and Mike Mignola and is not really a reflection of Hellboy. He had a good idea and some good creature characteristics but, in the end, the book was a slight disappointment. Advancing quickly to the book, you saw what a good director could do with something that needed a touch of gold (to forgive the pun). The toothfairies, Wink, the elemental, the goblin, the angel (if you want to understand that little beast and what it says more, take a look at the backstory at Anung Un Rama and the way the beast was created. story and highlights some nice little things that a person should see for themselves to really understand everything) and all the characters in between. Fortunately, the casting has always been good, the direction is fabulous, and Hellboy is portrayed in the way Hellboy should be portrayed. This means he thinks with his fist, he has a gun the size of a small man, and he\'s not really full of a little thing called respect. Regarding the film, let me say that he had a bit of everything. The action was quite good, the human elements (and I freely use the humans) of the story were fantastic, and the film explored a bit more of what the BRPD is. They allowed viewers to enter into each person, their tastes and their desires, and added a new character that translated strangely from book to film, but still translated well as a character. Even Ron is a perfect Hellboy, and let this shine in this new installment. In the part with the elemental you can see how much is hit, and in fighting with specific beings you can say that you do not want to hurt them. He wants to be appreciated by everyone and understands the difficult situation of things that ""threaten"" humanity. Del Toro adds that it\'s done fantastically because it\'s one of Hellboy\'s stuff in the books - enough so the BPRD and he really have big problems. If you like Hellboy and you want a movie on the subject, this is good work. I know there have been a lot of complaints here and there about some aspects of the film, but Hellboy is a solid follower and a fan of novels / the first film will have fun. If you pay more attention to the details involved, you will find all kinds of good things hidden in the background, allowing you to peek at what Anung Un Rama is fighting as a human-made-devil from his own choices. You can also see the potential elements that could have ramifications for the world and for all those who live in it - I loved that too. Combine it with MUCH extra (we also have a comic that moves to keep ADD observers in satiety), and you have a second help that explores what the first film could only build. Highly loved.'",1
"b""I thought I had found a gem .... A DVD set that covered the performances of one of the pioneers of metal ... the early years of one of the greatest bands ever. Um ... no. Someone is issuing a deliberate deception of Deep Purple DVDs that seem to suggest that you will get live shows, but all you get is a lot of strangers reminiscent of the band. The very few performances you get on one of these dogs have a terrible A / V quality. My expectations were never high regarding A / V based on when they were recorded. But the big problem is that THERE ARE DIFFERENT PERFORMANCES. These series of Critical Review are DVDs of interviews with a group of people who perhaps knew the group. And with the performances (mostly cut out) that you get, you start screaming in front of the TV to show the dangerous artists; the clips show things like the audience, the moon or the sky while the band plays. The price of this version is a joke for the trash content that you get. This piece of shit is not worth even 1 dollar in my opinion for the relatively interesting Deep Purple articles that are obtained during the set. Purple Purple fans can not be fooled. Go with Live In Concert 72/73 (though unfortunately mostly black and white) and / or Live in California '74 if you liked the years of Coverdale / Burn.

"b""First of all I have to say this. If you expect a story or a hero like Spider-Man, you're in shock. The directors of Daredevil are one of the best directors I have ever seen. Not only does the plot have more substance with the addition of deleted scenes, but also the plot holes. There was also an entire subplot on the blind lawyer Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) and Foggy Nelson (Jon Faverou) who defended what looks like a guilty client, played by the rapper of the 90s Coolio. In this cut, see Matt Murdock more, and you can actually see why Mark Steven Johnson chose Affleck to play the blind eve. When I saw the original version for the first time, I thought Affleck was ok. But after this, I can say that Affleck was the perfect choice for Daredevil / Matt Murdock. But I still have to say that Collin Farrell as Bullseye steals the show. Not only did he make him play tea, he also made Bullseye a more interesting character than he is in the comic book series. The director's cut R also has a more gritty and obscure side of the film, compared to the PG 13 rating that has the original version. Expect more graphic combat scenes and much more swearing by the characters. Overall, I must say that this cut certainly makes justice to fans of comics. If you do not have this in your collection, take it. This DVD also has a good mini documentary on how the director was made.""",1

Also, there is no instruction or recall of movements, it is basically trying to follow Tracy while dancing in her studio.'",0
"b'Every time a film shoots for ""realism"", it generally opens the door to a predictable set of signifiers: portable cameras, real places, a naturalistic lighting scheme, streetwise dialogues and tortured methodical tournaments. In just two films, Funny Ha Ha and the new mutual appreciation, the writer and director Andrew Bujalski reconfigured the language in something much closer to reality. His aesthetic and semi-improvised do-it-yourself dialogue has earned him frequent comparisons with John Cassavetes, but he does not care almost as much for acute emotions; the characters in his films are clumsy and inexpressive to the point where they can not say what they feel, at least not without being uncomfortable. Mutual appreciation is not much more than a refinement of Funny Ha Ha, following a similar group of slackers in their twenties as they struggle with relationship problems and try to give some traction to their lives. Yet it is equally disturbing to watch, because Bujalski\'s stylized dialogue brand sounds sincerely. The charismatic Justin Rice plays a musician who moves to New York immediately after the break of his band, which puts him in a strange position, since he will play later in the week. Once in town, Rice reconnects with her friend Bujalski, a good college student, and Bujalski\'s girlfriend, Rachel Clift, to whom Rice begins to develop an unspoken attraction (and, by chance, mutual). Meanwhile, Rice finds a sample and much more in the attractive college radio DJ Seung-min Lee, but gets in trouble when he brings Lee\'s brother to play as his drummer and tries to get away from her in a romantic way. meeting between Rice and Clift and a serious break in their relationship with Bujalski, but nothing in Mutual Appalation goes according to the usual script. The scene where Rice and Clift finally vocalize their feelings for each other is the perfect example of what Bujalski does so well: any other romantic melodrama would make them boil with passion, but these characters are painfully temporary and credible. since we are both cheating on someone they care about. What ends up happening between them is completely unexpected, but quite true for what they are and for how most of the caring people would act. But such things rarely happen on the screen, and Bujalski\'s willingness to follow him makes him a singular talent.'",1

"b'God, this movie really did me the whole thing. As a film of atmosphere, this is definitely a masterpiece. It is a real chiller and is based on mood and a disturbing atmosphere, rather than on sudden attacks of frustration and violence. The film is set in an old house in Jersey shortly after the Second World War. Nymph Kidman plays the landlady, living there with her two children as she waits for her husband to come home from the war. At the beginning of the film three film assistants arrive to give assistance. These remain the only characters who really got involved in the film. Nanni Kidman is excellent in the role as well as the two children. Children suffer from a rare condition where they can not be exposed to bright light. This leads to dark scenes in which the film is almost entirely set in candle-lit darkness. To prevent children from being exposed to any light, all doors in each room must be locked and unlocked at the entrance. the film is spent with the panic opening and the loss of these rooms as there is some strange presence in the house. In many ways some of these scenes are quite reminiscent of The Sixth Sense scenes. even the interpreters begin to take place. It gives the film an incredibly intriguing feeling that made me feel constantly on the limit throughout its duration. He never seems sure of where he is leading this whole story, so the sense of mystery is quite unique. When they leave the house, the outside is covered by this almost surreal fog, which recreates the atmosphere beautifully. It reminded me of those films by Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes that gave me the chills as a child. the sun would have come out if only to temporarily raise the atmosphere to give the viewer a bit of a break from all this tension. The rhythm really rallies while the film reaches a very, very dramatic conclusion. Beautifully shot, really gothic, brilliantly acted and worth seeing.'",1

Joy turned into disgust when I sat down to watch it: the process of converting PAL to NTSC seems to have been done in someone's garden for second-hand video editing equipment.

John-Pyper Ferguson should be happy not to have sustained permanent damage to the jaw for chewing so much the scenery, but it fits perfectly into the film.

This is probably the only time I will say it, but DO NOT listen to the people who gave it five stars. They honestly do not know what they are talking about.""",0

With all these great things, why would a company reduce a big job like this? The six-hour version was already abbreviated by the nine-hour game.

"b'Right there with ""Airplanes, Trains and Cars"" and ""There\'s something about Mary"" there\'s Billy Murray\'s favorite comedy ... `` Goundhog Day \'\'. Murray (like TV Weatherman Phil Connors) is easily the Hollywood star of the film, as the rest of the cast is much less known in the field. Andie MacDowell was probably best known for her modeling career in 1993, which as an actress does a simply wonderful job like ""Rita,"" the television producer. Chris Elliot does a great job in a less annoying role than he is used to ""Larry"" the cameraman (he has come a long way to be ""The Man Under The Stairs"" on David Letterman). The other actor who really impresses is the man with the recognizable face, but what\'s his name (Stephen Tobolowsky as life insurance salesman Ned ""Bing!"" Ryerson). Oh, and Scooter the groundhog. As for the story, Bill Murray is stuck in the same cold day (which happens to be Groundhog Day) in Punxsutawney, PA which covers the now famous holidays. Continue to relive the same day, again and again. Every day sees the same things. Every day he meets the same people ... the man in the corridor early in the morning, the maid Doris, the mayor of the city, etc. He decides to make the most of the situation and does what he wants ... just because he knows he will wake up the next day and it will be the same day again. While he grows tired of reliving the same day over and over again, Connors shifts his attention to Rita. First of all, trying to impress her. So, trying to really take care of her. When it finally breaks, the spell is broken and appears the next day. I classify some of Bill Murray\'s films as classics ... that is. `` Caddyshack \'\', `` Stripes \'\', `` Scrooged \'\', `` What About Bob \'\', etc ... but I put the `` Groundhog Day \'\' at the top of the list.

"b'One of the most delightful films of recent years, ""Calendar Girls,"" a version of ""The Full Monty,"" is the true story of a group of middle-aged English women who became international celebrities when they designed and placed for a calendar of fundraising naked that has sold millions of copies worldwide.

Each of the ""girls"" is gifted with her unique personality, so that we do not see them only as a group, united in this stimulating enterprise, but as individuals who work through their personal demons on the path to completion of the project. Women face the planned checkpoints and the snafus in the form of ""disapproving"" voices, disapproval in the community, but their belief in the rightness of their cause removes all these problems. This fascinating film offers more sincere and authentic laughter than almost all the comedies of recent times. `` Calendar Girls \'\' is moving, touching and stimulating - and what more can one ask of a ""good-humor"" movie?'",1

"b'Looking at ""The Scent of Green Papaya""? it\'s like listening to a harmonious song. There is not much dialogue in this film, but you will not feel boring. I like the quiet, elegant and graceful atmosphere of the film. He uses many simple melodies and close shots in the film to reflect the mood of the characters. Visual and auditory beauty gives you comfort when you look at it. The first part of the film takes place in 1951, when the French authorities almost came to an end. The French occupied Vietnam for over 30 years before 1954. During the French administration, people in Vietnam had been influenced by the French. In the first half of the film, Mui lived in a traditional family as a servant. Grandma lost her husband when she was still a teenager and insisted on praying for her husband every morning and remaining loyal to him. The father left home with another woman and took all the money a couple of times, but his mother would never blame him. Instead, her grandmother blamed her for not knowing how to satisfy her husband. In the second part of the film, Mui moved to a musician\'s house as a servant. The musician, who is also his teacher, named Khuyen, was influenced by the French and knows how to play the piano. His house was decorated in French style, colorful and bright. Unlike the previous family, simple, ancient and entirely made of wood. Khuyen was engaged, but later discovered that Mui was really very attractive after getting dressed. He fell for her and later broke up with her boyfriend? and he married Mui. This film shows the difference between a traditional Vietnamese family and a modern Western family. Not only does the living environment have a big difference but also the perception of relationships.'",1

"b""With a better direction and acting, I think * Foxy Brown * could have been a fantastic movie. As it is, it is practically a decent plot full of distractions caused by a terrible and outrageous 1970s fashion show (the latter, however, is almost a reason enough to see the film). Pam Grier, despite his great impertinent attitude and security on screen, seems tormented by a terrible delivery of his lines. (There are no null successes, but several attempts to deliver decent one-liners). Fortunately, however, Grier's inability to deliver is overshadowed by the terrible acting of Katheryn Loder, who may have given one of the worst interpretations I've ever seen from an actress. None of the cast, however, seems particularly talented, with the best being Juanita Brown as the callgirl Claudia and Antonio Fargas in the role of the treacherous and inetto, Foxy's thug brother, Link. It's still a decent film, though maybe it's not what you want to put too high on your list `` you have to see ''. If fashion does not appeal to you, it's worth seeing the great action scenes of Grier and the often ridiculous and seemingly endless amount of random sexual situations that can be found here. If you're a fan of the '70s chic, Pam Grier or Blaxploitation, it's a must. Otherwise, rent it if you like a lot of violence and can not find any Tarantino movies.""",0

"b""Welcome to The Rileys attracted me more and more as the film progressed; at first I thought it was a bit too slow, but when the pace grew with the New Orleans background I was quite impressed with what he had to say. The casting could not have been better; Melissa Leo performs exceptionally as a guilty housewife who punishes herself for a car accident that took her daughter's life; and James Gandolfini turns into a masterful performance like her husband Doug who just can not overcome the pain and personal demons. The choreography and cinematography improve the film and the soundtrack does a great job in making the film even better, also.Lois Riley (Melissa Leo) and her husband Doug (James Gandolfini) are even more miserable even though they are eight years after their death of their daughter in a car accident. Lois did not leave the house after the car accident; in fact, Lois has been so depressed that she already has tombstones for her and Doug near her dead daughter's grave, a fact that gives Doug the creeps. Doug also has a long-standing relationship with a maid named Vivian (Eisa Davis). However, when Vivian suddenly dies of a heart attack, Doug is very upset and still sad; and he suffers in silence because he does not know that Lois had been aware of him and Vivian for some time. Doug goes to a corporate convention in New Orleans; and being still upset by the death of Vivian (he wanted to take her there for his birthday) and also feeling out of place in a very different city from the one where he lives with his wife, Doug leaves the convention early one day and wanders in a striptease where meets a girl called a minor who bears several names including Mallory (Kristen Stewart of the fame of `` Twilight ''). Doug and Mallory begin an unconventional relationship; she reminds Doug of her daughter. So, what does Doug do? He calls Lois to tell her that he stays in New Orleans indefinitely without giving any reason to Lois; he moved with Mallory paying her $ 100 a day to stay with her in her dilapidated apartment in a house that was abandoned after Hurricane Katrina and Doug desperately tries to grow Mallory with a combination of love and confrontation that Mallory needs . Meanwhile, Lois decides to finally leave their home after nearly eight years of staying at home - she is determined to drive up to New Orleans and find Doug there by calling him on the phone. Obviously, the rest of what transpires offers us a very solid plot and good entertainment. I could tell you more; but there will not be any spoilers here even though it might seem like I've already told you too much! Suffice it to say that the rest of the plot should attract your attention very well. In addition, look for the excellent performances of Tiffany Coty in the role of Tara and Lance E. Nichols in an all too brief appearance as Hamilton 'Ham' Watkins, another businessman at the convention. The DVD also has an extra on making the film. I recommend this film to anyone interested in family drama or drama in general; and of course the fans of the actors in this film would do well to add this to their collections.""",1
"b""One Body Too Many a 1944 black and white film is not a particularly beautiful film. BUT, it's a funny movie.

He is shown in his customer office and immediately begins his speech on the back of a chair and smoke coming from a lit cigar. However, unbeknownst to Tuttle the client is dead and in his coffin in the office. Tuttle puts his brief case on the closed coffin before he understands what's in the room. When he tries to get out, he can not open the door, etc. This film is full of all imaginable clich\xc3\xa9s. But this is fun.

Of course, a very nervous and reluctant hero. This kind of film would be nothing without Lyle Talbot and he's here as a family member who thinks Jack Haley has something to hide. I've had this film for years and every so often I resurfaced it to watch it again because sometimes you need a little harmless fun. (~. ~)""",0

The plot bears little resemblance to any version of Babes in Toyland I\'ve seen. The dancers seem to be under rehearsal, and the actors shamelessly do it. The child actors must restrain themselves from the laughter of adults and the failures of the props. The Winnie the Pooh segment is a little better, made with the marionettes of Bill and Cora Baird, who made the ""Lonely Goatherd"" sequence in Sound of Music. It would be good for the children to watch.'",0
"b""This was probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and it's actually saying a lot. It's never a good sign when the best acting in a movie comes from prostitutes hired to behave like, yes, you guessed it, prostitutes. Everyone else seemed to show up to earn an easy check by paying for costumes and playing with blood geysers during so-called action sequences. The only thing that saved was the fact that it was so bad that you could not help but laugh and wonder, Michael Madsen was really drunk all through the movie? If it were really true, it would be very useful to explain how bad his performance was, and if so, maybe the rest of the cast was quietly joining him. In any case, I've never played video games, so I can not really compare it to that, all I can say is that as a separate movie it was a waste of money.""",0

"b""This joyful flim is located in Miramont Place, Pimlico (a district of South London). When an unexploded bomb left by World War II goes out, local shop owner Stanley Holloway discovers an ancient treasure trove, including a mysterious document. An eccentric university professor (Margaret Rutherford) translates the document, and shows that Miramont Place was the site of a palace given to the Duke of Burgundy in exile by King Edward IV, making the inhabitants of Miramont Place native to Burgundy rather than Britain. The locals go crazy, rip the ration books and keep the local pub open all night, they have a lot of fun until the government gets bad and starts cracking them. He enters a shabby French that turns out to be the current duke, who came to claim his legacy and save his subjects from the iron hand of beurocracy. Under the siege, the Burgundian rebels take the subway trains and pass passengers through customs, the government takes revenge by extinguishing their water reserves, who will win in the battle of intelligence? If you're a fan of the eccentric British comedy, this film is such a classic.""",1
"b""I usually hate souls. I'm the kind of person who complains every time I see a book turned into a movie, just because I do not think that the adaptations do justice to the original work. I'm a big fan of the manga, so I thought I'd give a film to the anime. I was extremely shocked when I started watching. This show is as good as the manga. The plot follows, with the addition / subtraction of some plot points and a different plot of Ouran Fair. Each of the dubbers (in English and Japanese) does justice to each character. The characters themselves are hilarious and different. The plot is fun. Do not be fooled by the pink cover; this show is not even that girly / shojo-y. The fact that I actually bought the series really says something, especially since I watched the whole series twice through a friend before buying it on Amazon (and I'm super-duper frugal). Since I bought it, I've seen all the episodes at least twice more, my favorites more. This is really a must. If I could, I would give this series a higher rating.""",1
"b""I'm an avid horror movie goer. My taste in horror movies may not be the best, I admit I'm a bit fussy, but they still have to be worth looking at. This film has no ransom quality in any way.

I would not even recommend renting it.""",0
"b'After all the clamor about this film I was expecting something completely different. The documentary spoke more of the White family and hardly focused on Jesco. With The Dancing Outlaw Jesco was the spotlight and seemed to be the worst of the family when it came to a mental state, yet in this it seems to be the only sane one. The documentaries are made to provoke emotions whether it be happiness, pain, hate, love or otherwise, the documentaries are made for that reason. This is completely successful, but not in the way I imagined it. I could not help but think how dishonorable this family is for D Ray White and West Virginia. They openly boast of shooting people, killing people, selling drugs, defrauding prescriptions and snorting pills in front of their newborn (which CPS takes away, thank God). It disgusted me, but that\'s what this documentary had to do. I loved it, I\'m a big fan of Jesco White and I thought it was as good as The Dancing Outlaw. I feel that Dickhouse Pictures has exploited this dysfunctional family in the name of ""Legacy"", which I imagine is legitimate ... but not very cool. I highly recommend it, but it is part of the episode ""Intervention"", part COPS and part Gummo. Sometimes it seemed a little fake, but the fact that it was a kind of shock for a second. If this makes sense, it\'s basically like a car accident. The soundtrack is also fantastic with Hank III, Lefty Frizzell and GG Allin.'",1
"b'CHARLOTTE SOMETIMES is a nocturne film, a story that flows gently through the lives of four people and with very few words says a lot about human relationships, the cocoons that we rotate on ourselves for security, for protection against fear, for hope the chrysalis will turn into a butterfly or moth. Eric Byler must be praised for having the courage to keep this story simple - a story of four ""disorders"" of the personality and how they find the means to exist in this strange world. Michael Idemoto is perhaps the most solitary outwardly, but all four characters seem to want connection and simply can not attack. Eugenia Yuan is the idiot girl-girl, Jacquelyn Kim is the mystery woman who with Matt Westmore plays more a catalytic agent than a character. All four actors are beautiful, sensitive and convincing. Lighting and settings are well chosen. All in all, this small independent film is a quiet diversion, which deals with more than just a simple screenplay.'",1
"b""With such a talented cast and a semi-decent story, you think it would be a great movie. Richard Gere plays a gynecologist in a big city in Texas.

That's when golf pro Helen Hunt moves into town and is immediately infatuated by her. I love Robert Altman. He's a great storyteller, but there was something missing in this film. If you really love Altman, then take the time to watch it ... if you do not normally do it, then you may want to avoid it.""",0

"b""After reading the review of MOUSEENEER, boy I'm glad I did not wait for the full version, even if I had it on Laserdisc, it did not seem to add much more space to the film, the only thing this is different is the scene of crime at the beginning is a bit 'more graphic, the sex scene of Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone is a little' more revealing, (sounds oral sex that is quite vivid), apart from the fact that this film is the same as version R, this is a psychological rollercoaster ride, but it's good, it can be perceived as a sex movie, but it's a crime thriller that makes you guess until the end, and you're still not sure who the killer is, it's been told by the media that Douglas & Stone hated each other in this film (which could not get along) even if you can not say looking, it would not be hard to believe, given the ego of both Douglas and Stone, despite this is a great police thriller that does not it should be gnored, & Sharon Stone looks her best here, I can not honestly say right now, since she cut her long blonde hair (not wise) but here she shines like Catherine Trammel, a role that Julia Roberts has turned down, Stone is perfect here and this will always be his best role.""",1
"b'I believe that for decades, when film school students will study the history of American animation, the Iron Giant will be considered perhaps the last great example of traditionally hand-drawn animation films, before the transition to computer animation in search of Nemo. The important thing about this film is that when it was originally released in theaters, its promotion was underfunded and simply ugly, which was not very successful. Fortunately, he got a devoted following on VHS and DVD. This film is an example of what animation films usually do in Japan, but rarely do it in the United States. It is well written, visually impressive and works for all ages, not just for children. He warned that it may not be suitable for very young children. The climatic battle sequence presents a potentially frightening transformation of the Iron Giant. Do not get me wrong, this film is suitable for everyone, but the youngest viewers and * most * very young children can probably take good care of it. But some children are more sensitive and prone to nightmares than others, so if you have children under the age of 6, I suggest you preview the film before allowing them to watch it. Some films are better rented, others are better bought. This is in the latter category: it\'s a keeper! If you are an adult who has written animated films as ""children\'s things"" because they tend to be banal and formal, you have to do it yourself to see this film. Many reviewers are so easily pleased that they appear to be incapable of giving less than 5 stars, which is a shame, because this is a film that deserves to stand out from the crowd, and absolutely earned its 5-star rating.'",1
"b""I watched this animated show for the past 10 years, I'm 20 now. Honestly I can say that I still can not find the wrong thing with Gargoyles.

"b'After spying on this series on the shelves of my local library and I saw that it was an aspiring female chef set between 1900-1910 in London, I collected all the volumes. This series really surprised me: it has a strong writing and attention to the setting. Louisa Trotter is a frank, cockney chef who is making headway in her profession and in British society with a lot of elbow grease, an understanding of human nature and a bit of luck. Gemma Jones is as fantastic as Louisa Trotter and the support cast is also very solid. At the beginning I was not sure if this series was a miniseries or a TV series (It\'s the TV), but it\'s rather Dickensian because the episode is based on the previous one. And I can pay for a series that is no longer complete than saying that the resolutions of the conflict are neither trivial nor superficial. Many allusions to historically accurate events, political and contemporary culture are intertwined in the plots. I feel that I have learned more about English classism and social customs from the ""Duchess"" and the Bentinck Hotel than from my semester abroad in London. If you like vintage dramas (and comedy) and strong and nuanced heroines with lots of battles to fight, then you\'ll like ""The Duchess of Duke Street"". \'\' This series has stood the test of time. My only complaint is that I have not learned much about the culinary arts, but the writing is so above the norm that my complaint is made irrelevant. Although this series started shooting in 1976, production values \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bmake placement difficult. The Duchess of Duke Street is comparable in quality to the 1979 BBC Pride and Prejudice.'",1
"b'This morning I ripped the shrink from this little gem with the joy of a six-year-old delinquent who spent a day in a Cadbury candy factory. Then I sat down to watch it and emerged two hours later with the smile of a 51-year-old Cheshire cat on Viagra. We all know that ""The Italian Job"" is a classic of the Sixties, but what you do not know is that this reissue of the 40th Anniversary (released June 15, 2009 in the United Kingdom) is simply out of scale ... First of all the press - which is GLORIOUS - it is pristine as you could hope for and a joy from beginning to end. And although I do not state it in the outer box, this is the fully restored British Film Institute version, which has been cleaned frame by frame (and the clean shots are used in the ""Making Of"" extras) as well). One of these features is the reprint trailer of the 30th Anniversary of 10 years ago, which uses the famous sequence ""... behind closed doors ..."". Intact - is covered by scratches and has no definition - allows you to see how the film looked compared to how beautiful it is now after the restoration. There are so many scenes that now stand out - like Matt Monro \'s cheesy song ""On Days Like These"" sounds and the car crosses the Alps in the opening credits - when Charlie gets out of jail as he goes through the gates and Maggie Blye greets him in a car stolen from the Pakistani embassy - when the three Mini Coopers climb the roof of the football stadium with the Italian cops in pursuit - it\'s all BEAUTIFUL. The BFI has also done ""Zulu"", ""Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner"" and ""Saturday Night And Sunday Morning"" and this has the same astonishing standards they have (see my reviews). The extras are also generous (almost two hours): 1. Commentary with screenwriter Tony Kennedy Martin and author Matthew Field2. Producer commentary Michael Deeley and Author Matthew Field3. Mini adventures (in HD) 4. ""Self Preservation Society: The Making Off The Italian Job"" (in HD) - presents new interviews with the cast, writers, producers including Michel Caine, Maggie Blye, Troy Kennedy Martin, Michael Deeley, reminiscences on Noel Coward, director Peter Collinson, Quincy Jones on the best score etc ... 5. Music video (in HD) 6. The scene deleted with comment by author Matthew Field7. Theatrical trailer8. Re-release TrailerThe casting was a mix of luck, destiny and genius. Caine is perfect as Charlie Croker, the probable boy, Benny Hill as the boffin of the computer, the soave and deadly Raf Vallone as the boss of the Mafia of Turin and Tony Beckley as the Campo Freddy dressed in an elegant way. But the greatest coup was Noel Coward in the role of Mr. Bridger, the criminal-master who was on time in his Majesty\'s prison service. He has tea and scones, worries about the British economy and his cell is plastered with images of the Queen. Coward is priceless as far as the prison enclosure floor is concerned, ""Rule Britannia"" played behind him by a string quartet - it\'s enough to make you scream with laughter ... See you\'ve forgotten how much fun Job is - the a gay sarcophagus who says that Charlie\'s pre-prison clothes could now be part of a museum exhibition, Coward standing next to two prison guards while holding out his two newspapers and a roll of toilet paper. The amazement of Governor of Prison John Le Mesurier, while Coward complains that ""his"" cabinet was invaded by Michael Caine (catching him) - a man\'s toilet is his castle ... John Clive counting the money that Michael Caine just gave him to take care of his Aston Martin DB - he was in his garage for two years while Caine was absent in India. ""I was turning old tigers ..."" ""The owner of a garage counting the fifties"", ""... there must have been many tigers ladies ..."" ""The locations in Turin are wonderfully colored, the mountain scenes as crispy as those of James Bond\'s re-enactments and Caine\'s freckles clearer than ever - all - fishing! I\'ve seen a lot of old guys on the new BLU RAY format recently - some successful, some painful - but that\'s up there with the best. In fact, as a man who adores the medium and believes in his possibilities, I suspect that Michael Caine pink will tickle me that his films ""Zulu"" and ""The Italian Job"" are both doing a lot to establish BLU RAY as `the \' format to restore old movies and keep them properly.For the David Lean guys ...

"b'While this is an excellent adaptation of the first 24 chapters or so of J.K.

In a ""Complete Movie Collection"" with all other films and 3. Perhaps as an ""Extended Edition"" combined with Part 2. So why should I be so foolish to pay $ 15-25 for this now?

"b'Having seen this film several times, I absolutely have to evaluate Gigi as one of the most fascinating musicals ever made. The delightful soundtrack of Lerner & Loewe includes songs like ""I Remember It Well"", ""The Night They Invented Champagne"", ""Thank Heaven For Little Girls"", as well as the title track, """" Gigi "", sang with surprising candor and Louis Jourdan\'s seriousness: the three main ones, Leslie Caron, Louis Jourdan and Maurice Chevalier, together with the locals of Paris, contribute to maintain a typically French flavor, especially in the way in which the characters relate and interact. the political inaccuracy of history, a closer look will actually reveal the true feminist perspective of Colette\'s work that has been revolutionary for its time: 1) history is a commentary on the limited social and economic options for women outside marriage ( or prostitution for this) during the turn of the century, 2) Although Gigi (Caron) never fully mastered his lessons and his care, he is able to capture the heart of Gasto n (Jourdan) precisely because of its imperfections and, above all, it is Gaston rather than Gigi who is forced to truly transform and challenge the social conventions of the time to bring the story to its resolution. Compare this with My Fair Lady, which offers similar social commentary, but resolves in a more standard way; although in the end Professor Higgins finally realizes his love for Eliza, it is Eliza who is forced to submit to her will by implementing a reconciliation that does nothing to solve any of the problems raised in the scenes that lead to that point. Surely you see Gigi and judged alone. (Be sure to watch only the widescreen version! The full screen version is awful with whole characters cut off from some scenes, like Hermione Gingold\'s during most of the ""I Remember It Well"" sequence.'",1

"b""Limey is probably Soderberghs' best work, better than Traffic and Erin Brockovich, only Out of Sight and Sex, Lies and Videotape are close. The Limey is one of the few films I've seen where the film's stylistic opportunities make the film not just a self-indulgent piece of art to be discussed in film lessons, but a moving film that resonates and stays with you. Terence Stamp plays the main character Wilson as a tough and sad English criminal who is trying to find out what happened to his daughter. His research has gender bases, but this film is above any gender label. A lot of credit must go to the script by Lem Dobbs who overshadows the clich\xc3\xa9 and injects some notable comedies into the mix. But the editing style of this film is why I love it, it works in waves like memories, it's the only movie I've seen that shows exactly how your mind can go from one thing to another. Right now, it seems to me that an art student with his chin frowning on his own importance. But look at the movie and you'll see what I mean. The best part of this film is that it's sad, the ending is not a huge breakthrough or a copout, it's just deeply sad, and there are not many films that evoke that feeling in me today.

Rebecca looks for the way of the exit-stage-left that gives her more money at any cost.The story plays as a check list of eroticism - there is voyeurism, a striptease, sad at the Cannes Film Festival. with style - split screen, wide camera angles - and it\'s fun to watch it in action - but it\'s still not enough to plug the holes in the story.The ending tries to pull everything into the dark themes of the film in a happy finish silver, but it will leave you betrayed. Despite the power of the star, I did not like the Femme Fatale. True, Rebecca was not blue - fans of her role as X-Men will not be disappointed. The character of Antonio Banderas had one or two interesting scenes, but in large part he remained involved in doing whatever was manipulated, without original solutions out of his situation. Seeing him coming out with a clever escape would have been a much better ending - but, as it is, the end has relied on an exaggerated gimmick to get out of his sad ending.Pass on Femme Fatale - even if you\'re trying to see Rebecca in a light not X-Men. Despite all the pomp, it is not worth investing.'",0
"b'Synopsis: John Ritter plays the role of Roy Knable, a true couch potato whose life and marriage are disintegrating around his ears while watching TV to escape everything. The same night his wife Helen (Pam Dawber) intends to leave him, a mysterious seller named Spike (Jeffrey Jones) seems to sell Roy a new TV, complete with a giant satellite dish that will broadcast 666 channels directly to Roy \'s living room. Yet something goes wrong when Roy and his wife are sucked into the satellite dish and enter the infernal world of Satan TV. From there it is a hectic rush to survive before time runs out. About the Movie: Stay Tuned is probably one of my favorite comedy films. I saw it for the first time in the early 90s and when I saw it was released on DVD I jumped at the chance to get it. Stay Tuned is full of slapstick humor, lots of comedies very contorted on the classic cliche of television; s and TV shows. These include Saturday Night Live, Star Trek The Next Generation, Three\'s Company, WWF and classic cartoons. The cartoon is presented in a marvelously delightful animated sequence that was actually supervised in production by legendary animator Chuck Jones (who made many of Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck cartoons). This is really the top of the films John Ritter has played with. Ritter timekeeping helps make this film. Although this film has never been noticed, it is certainly an excellent example of why John Ritter\'s career lasted over two decades. He was very good at what he did.Veteran comic Eugene Levy (""SCTV"" and ""American Pie"") also plays an important role in this film as Crowley, a down and out Hell TV Exec which helps the Knables in their travel. He can play the lovable slimeball in a fun way. Jeffrey Jones plays the villain, Hell TV CEO, Spike. He\'s a great actor for the villain in a comedy, and he manages to be convincingly wicked and entertaining at the same time without making the role seem stupid, as it tends to happen to villains in slapstick comedies these days. With John Ritter \'The Comic Moment and Pam Dawber playing the straight man as they fall from the demented channel to the demented channel, this film is great for many laughs. DVD Information: Stay Tuned comes in a cardboard DVD case, marking it as an economic rate. It is presented in widescreen format with Dolby Digital 5.1 audio. Both the image and the sound are quite good. I did not notice any problems with either. The DVD is translated into French (why is not Spanish?) And has subtitles in English, French and Spanish. For special features, the DVD comes with an extended theatrical trailer, cast information and a behind-the-scenes look at the film. Cast information is simply a list of actors in the film. They do not even provide the bios for them, making this a clear case of strengthening content with minimal effort. The featurette is the kind they used to show on television just before the movie came out, with cast interviews that are completely unenlightening if you\'ve seen the movie. It is only slightly interesting. The downside is that the music that is played behind the commentator is definitely annoying during the first quarter. This DVD version is a standard version with no frills. Overall, a great movie on a standard version of DVD not exciting. 4 stars'",1

"b""I'm not as articulated as some of the others who review here. All I can say about this is that we need this kind of entertainment so desperately. This series blends the various beliefs in the supernatural, in the paranormal, in religion and in the side of humanity that often hides in the darkness far from us because we lack the heart to accept who or what they are. This is a carnival full of freeks and geeks. Who will fight until death for each other. This is a magical show set in a desolate place. Which is perfect The feeling of isolation only adds to the mystery and magic of this program. The unbalanced are real. And we get to live with each other for an hour at a time. And after a while you'll start to forget how different they are. Aside from realizing that perhaps this world was created for them. And not for us. Maybe we are the freek. He said NUF. This show is brilliant.""",1
"b'If I had not said it before, I will be a huge fan of the night of the living dead of George A. Romero and his sequels that he has done over the past forty years. Thanks to him, we really know the horrible world of the zombies and the undead with many details and we know in which frightful place can be trapped inside, whether it\'s an old farmhouse, a suburban mall, a bunker underground or a place that leaves you open to an attack by the executioners of the living. Of course, once you\'ve created such a popular character in Horror, the script thieves are trying to cash in on your original creation. Strangely, however, most of these types of films have had varying degrees of success, especially the Italian Zombi filmmakers of the \'80s. Unfortunately, however, what started all, the NOTLD of 1968, due to a snafu copyright, never had that precious right and soon it became clear to everyone that someone could or release it, own it and / or make any version with that plot and title in any way they choose.But first, a bit of history: in 1998 Anchor Bay and John A. Russo (one of the men to help create the original of \'68 with Romero) decided to publish a version of the 30th Anniversary of the classic, but instead of relaunching the same old print like any other DVD company, has shot and added new footage with the old, creating a new subframe that not only hurts the original film, but betrays the social comment that has been defined in the first place. A true misstep and the fans were not happy. However, when it came to completing the remakes, at least someone understood well even before that. In 1990, with the personal guide of Romero and the genius of FX Tom Savini at the helm, they realized a living Night Of The Dead that remained close to the original screenplay giving to those 90 years an update of which not only could be proud, but better in some aspects of the values \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bof gore and production. So, after a well done remake and a learning error in what not to do a classic, could it ever be redone? Apparently not . In 2006, with the director Jeff `` Corman Wanna-Be \'\' Broadstreet in the chair, they decided to try it again, obviously without Romero\'s consent, but this time with a twist: let\'s try to do it in 3D! 3D? Really ? It seems a curious idea, but in this case it is really flat. To be honest, NOTLD3D is a parody. Shot on a non-existent budget, this must be the worst ""reimagined"" of a film from 2001 Planet Of The Apes. Of course, most of your favorite characters are here, but this time mixed and played by actors who are so rigid, it is difficult to distinguish them from real zombies. And the story is so slow and boring that it looks like a 3am view of something you\'d expect to see on Sci-Fi Channel. Moreover, while the gore factor of the original of \'68 was minimal at best, 36 years later you can not see much yet, if only, but not for MPAA but financial reasons, and in fact halfway I wondered why this it has been classified as ""R"" in the first place. The new twists were boring, the boring sets, and the cameo of the newly crowned horror icon Sid Haig (which I think is not a big deal in the first place) is completely superfluous and only helps to establish that this was the maximum in terms of cash-in. So its main interest must be 3D, right? Mistaken . Instead of using the latest stereoscopic 3D technology (ie with ""shades of gray""), they went with the obsolete Anaglyphic type (red / blue) which in turn turns the whole film into a purple mess. And do not expect something to jump on you. When it works, and it is rare, it only gives depth to the backgrounds, which means that it makes the image deeper, not closer. It should also be noted that, apart from the characteristics of the behind the scenes, this entire disc is in 3D, which means that without glasses, it is unwatchable. There is no 2D version on the included disk as it should have been (that version is released separately), so once those glasses go it\'s the ultimate coaster. So, to sum up, bad movie, bad 3D, bad idea. It had already been redone in 1990, and eight years later it had already been given a gimmick that did not even work. Even just as a film, a flick of madness like Day Of The Dead 2: Contagium is a better movie. Difficult to suggest even if you are a completeist like me, NOTLD3D is a dead film that should have been buried. (RedSabbath Evaluation: 3.0 / 10)'",0

"b'First of all, I highly recommend the review below, from the ""Sideburns"" type. \'\' I think that captures the concrete foundations and the spirit for this film. I can understand how some who are ""Australia-philes"" may want to see a purely Australian product, and this is not that. It is not ""Smash Palace"" or many other good Australian films of that kind. What this film is, can be described in one word: WEIRD. This is a good thing. The genius of Eric Roberts was (and could still be again), his ability to seem to seemingly lose himself in his roles, and do so while lacking self-consciousness on how he runs into it. Seeing this film and seeing other excellent (and weird) films, including ""The Greenwich Village Pope"" and ""Runaway Train"", is seeing a career arc that was truly amazing. He seemed to enter serious films with a great talent around him, and then be able to play demanding roles (though, some similar, safe), with energy and command. Ok, on this movie. First of all, let\'s be honest, this is not a deep film. It is not meant to be. It\'s almost like an indie version of a film by brothers Farrely, at least their first, in which they do not mind taking risks and having fun. There is also a romantic subtext that they had (`` Kingpin \'\' - believe it or not, `` Me, Myself & Irene \'\') where, in a ridiculous way, they reflect what is in most people looking for the love or just looking for something in themselves, and find it reflected or - in the case of the main characters in the films Farrely, and certainly in ""Coca Cola Kid"", abbreviated by others. I\'m not saying that Woody Harrelson or Jim Carrey may have been the Coca Cola Kid, but what they all have in common, in the specific roles they played in these movies, is to wonder if anyone could or could find something remotely interesting about them in a romantic way. They are so completely indecent, it seems almost cartoonist - and then you think of many people we all know, and it is not so incredible. The music of the film alone is simply fantastic. The comedy of the characters of Coca Cola Robert is incredible, and is punctuated by this aboriginal boy who is playing his device - a guy that Roberts finds outside the local offices of Coca Cola, and promptly operates in service. It is really fun to see The Kid\'s mind working - marketing pushes ""spinnina"" as he conceives and employs his strategies. Everyone on both sides is equally mocked, and this is a really good film, mostly non-judgmental (rarely these days, eh?). There are other nice touches in the soundtrack and even me, I would be negligent, not to mention the NUTS, if I avoided the very beautiful scene of Greta Scaatchi where it is refreshing ... well, go see the movie! It is bizarre, it is revealing and very funny. He also does a great job in discussing cultural clashes, where, when everyone is harmless, you can see how progress stems from some disagreement, and yet you wonder if we are missing something in the translation. If this is vague, so is the film somehow, and I think it\'s exactly what the director was doing. Not everyone has to adapt perfectly. A lot does not, and this makes it seem real.'",1
"b""Scary Movie was one of the best comedies of 2000. With a parody of films like Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Blair Witch and The Matrix, this film will be loved by everyone.

Shawn and Marlon Wayans did a great job putting this film together and they got the biggest cast. Doofy's entire storyline is hilarious and hilarious, and at the end of this fantastic movie you'll be laughing out loud. So make sure you take Scary Movie. Everyone and everyone will appreciate this parody. Buy this DVD and have fun. HAPPY VISION!""",1

"b'Let me start by saying that I am NOT a beginner. So I can tell you with certainty that this IS NOT FOR THE BEGINNERS. Yes, I\'m screaming :) However, if you\'re a beginner, you can still use it if you pay close attention to what I\'m about to say. Women in particular, do not use 2 to 3 weights or weights for the whole workout the first time you complete it. NO MORE THAN 3 POUNDS, YOUR FIRST TIME, PLEASE! ! ! IF YOU HAVE WORKED FIRST, NO MORE THAN 5 POUNDS! ! ! Watch out for swimming and butterfly moves. I think it is better to use the NO weight for these 2 movements at the beginning. I recommend the above because most of the moves are done at speed, so if you\'ve already worked before or not, some moves are too fast to keep a good shape especially for a beginner. In addition, excessive pressure on the shoulders could put a strain on the neck. After the first time you do this DVD, you can understand what weights you need and if you want to disable some exercises that are a good idea. The coach is a bit annoying because he continues to call him your first ""beginner"" to train. It\'s very irritating because it\'s NOT technically a beginner\'s workout. Besides this, it can be a good workout for someone who has already worked before and slows down some moves and practices a good shape. It\'s hard to know how to do it if you\'ve never worked before. It\'s clear that ""beginner"" does not necessarily mean it\'s your first ever workout, but it could be for some. And remember, BOB coach insists that it\'s your first beginner workout, so he apparently thinks a first timer can do it. With this, he would have to advise the use of very light weights and had a modifier. I gave this DVD 2 stars because it\'s 2012 and there should be various options on the menu to show the changes and some other explanation. In summary, a beginner can do it, but DO NOT use more than 3 pounds for the first time. AND DO NOT discourage yourself if you can not do everything. Most beginners will not be able to do the whole thing the first time. Perhaps the BOB coach should change the name of the beginners, because it will be intimidating for most beginners and many will probably get hurt if they do not know how to behave on their own and use the correct technique.'",0
"b'Of all the American films by Fritz Lang, SCARLET STREET is my favorite. And now, finally, it is available in a version that I can actually see. This is, without a doubt, the edition of the best quality available. (All other distributors offer variants of the same grainy, blurry, dual-print public domain that has been around for years.) SCARLET STREET is a remake of LA CHIENNE (THE BITCH) by Jean Renoir, and it would have been great if Kino could have published both titles as Double Feature.

"b'It\'s my fault if I had higher expectations on this film, but I guess this movie was not made for guys like me. The acting is ok, the character of Matthew McConaughey, Ben and Kate Hudson, Andie just have to act and react. Dialogue does not matter. The character of Kate Hudson always has the upper hand, which is fine for a while, but after an hour it becomes tiring. She completely invades every aspect of Ben\'s life; we never see Andie\'s world apart from his two friends and the workplace. So, while both characters have a similar program, there is a total imbalance between the top hands, and this for me is the biggest flaw in the film. He endures all his attempts to ""lose him"", but all of this only produces frustration in Andie - and pushes her to do more crazy things. As a spectator you are dying to see her fall on her face only once. But this is wishful thinking. Ben\'s ability to recover from Andie\'s antics hardly intrigues me, and Andie\'s total lack of shame does not go along with me. Of course they both look great, and Hudson smiles positively when he smiles, but man, 112 minutes is a long time to endure this game. I can imagine that some people think this film is fantastic. Girl Power and everything. I do not know . But I think we can agree that the film was conceived as a vehicle for Kate Hudson\'s rise to fame. This film reminds me a little WHAT WOMEN WANT (with Mel Gibson) for a number of reasons, but mainly because it was written and produced by women - that in the world of men\'s cinema is a much-needed perspective - but Nancy Myers ( the producer / director of What Women Want) is definitely smarter than the ""brain"" of How to Lose A Guy in 10 Days. You just have to look at the DVD extras to see the proof. We meet two of the producers, both of whom obviously have a facelift. I\'m serious . It\'s disturbing . They talk about the material as if it were Shakespeare. Then there is the director Donald Petrie, who totally lacks any charisma. The fact of being with him is so cheap that it\'s probably more fun to watch than most of the movie. While sitting there chatting, a TV monitor behind him shoots still images from the film, and a clerk (with her back to the camera) stares at a static PC screen as she bites her nails and shakes her head a lot. He does it for the duration of the interviews with Petrie. Oh, and did I mention the background music that accompanies the extras? It\'s the music of department stores. Or lift music. Which one you hate the most. I did not care about the comment. Donald is boring. There are no outtakes, which is now unusual for a comedy. The deleted scenes are actually good, some honest emotions are shown by Andie and we get some more calm and private moments between the two protagonists. Look, everything started ok. It looked like a harmless and harmless romantic comedy, but the love story lasted about 10 minutes. I can summarize my review with this observation of the reason of the director Petrie who is interested in directing the film. He says it was because he discovered that Kate Hudson was connected to it. Aha. So basically, if the film is good at the box office, then it will launch Hudson AND\'s career. Sorry Petrie, but it\'s not good enough for me.'",0

Eventually, a desperate ex-CIA struggles to spill the beans. He will do it? Will she do it? There is suspense in this suspense / science fiction movie; unfortunately, it is not intentional. It consists of asking yourself when the movie will have suspense. We know everything from the beginning. We know what is the secret of her husband and we know that eventually his wife will find out. The only advantage is that the director does what happens when Theron\'s character finally finds out, interesting. Unfortunately, he only discovers for about an hour and a half in a movie for two hours. How interesting could the rest be? Do the accounts. I absolutely adore Charlize Theron, both for her obvious charisma and her genuine dramatic ability. The way she was sucked into this piece of dragon could serve as a lesson for her. For me it is certainly a mystery because a woman who could play roles in ""Celebrity"" and ""Cider House Rules"" would select this script. Perhaps he felt he could save her, since the focus is on his character. Not her . The screenplay and direction simply made it impossible.

"b""It would be difficult to formulate a coherent film composed of disparate elements that the director and the others would obviously feel obliged to include in this scenario, but make a worthy attempt, which goes to pieces after the first semester. A pre-Columbian ceremonial disk, gilded and jeweled, was divided into two parts and while one half is exhibited in the permanent collection of the New York City museum, the other segment became the subject of a research expedition in an Andean region, under the 'aide of the American archaeologist Brooks Willings (David Keith), who is obsessed with his recovery. His wife and daughter remained in New York but when the young Diana (Camilla Belle) became a disciplinary problem in her school, the two joined Brooks in the Andean village where her expedition was based, her wife hoping to correct the Diana's behavioral discomfort, only to be weighed down by further problems arising from their new situation. The continuity falters at this point when Diana finds herself in the village's mystical rites, Brooks and his wife (cleverly played by Nancy Allen) fall into serious marital discord, a Catholic priest, played with humor by John Rhys-Davies is tormented by local cultists , the expedition has developed staff and lack of funding, among other things, - too many threads to weave into a completed plot. To solve its many self-imposed conundrums, work falls into an absurd fantasy, including stupid special effects, such as easy resolution. Keith is made of wood, manifestly devoid of inspiration for her role, but Belle is effective and Rhys-Davies's timing deserves to be studied, while the reciting of the laurels goes to the magnificent East Indian Roshan Seth, who easily dominates each of her scenes in the part of a shaman with extraordinary wisdom and magical powers.

"b'When Conan the Barbarian came out on video in 1981, he was one of the first to get it. The film has not lost the impact it has had on me then at the age of 20, and stands in front of all those pitying sorcery and sorcery films that have come on its heels, including the frightening sequel Conan the Destroyer. Why do I keep it so high in my estimate? Certainly not in the quality of acting; when you have two body builders, a surfer, a sports star and a dancer like five of the main actors in this film, then you will not have class acting - but even in this case this kind of movie does not need it. But having said that they did a good job when the script required some emotion to be inserted. Mourning, indecision, loyalty, friendship. It was all there. And revenge.Revenge is in fact the common thread that holds history together. This is why co-writers John Milius (the director) and Oliver Stone must be applauded, not only for daring to get away from the path of Robert E. Howard\'s pulp books that gave the world Conan, but also to give us a coherence, neat and fun script that does not offend intelligence (unlike the sequel). We have strong characters that you can sympathize with and bad guys that you want readily get their merits. Arnold Schwarzenegger in his debut film is perfect for the role, as well as James Earl Jones as the main antagonist, the wicked Thulsa Doom who is so caught up in power that he promptly encourages a faithful follower to commit suicide just to prove a point to Conan . And the story is accompanied by a high quality soundtrack written by Basil Polidouris. From the moment the credits begin, there is a deep, pulsating percussion sound that can take the viewer to another time and place, and make it believe that this is the music of the moment. The off-screen voice of Mako at the time the story is presented is unforgettable and I remember when I heard it for the first time. SCOPPIO! In came the melody of the theme. Pretty, hard and pleasant. As far as I\'m concerned, the only exceptional memory is the brilliant cinematography used when Conan is praying to his god, Crom, just before the final battle. He invokes revenge, while the camera runs with Thulsa Doom\'s harsh cohorts, the background music. A fantastic movie game and one that can not be improved. This should never be redone because they could never do a better job. This has a great story, an excellent soundtrack, strong characters, unforgettable scenes, which unfortunately were missing from the sequel. I am not bound by any loyalty to the pulp narrative of Robert E. Howard, so I do not care that this film is deviated from the ""real"" Conan world.'",1
"b""This film is a refreshing look at romance, very European (though American) and with a fantastic chemistry. The unique, fun, (pseudo-) intellectual conversation practically unabated in the film is great and the characters are believable. One might almost think that the actors were not following a script, but instead were simply exchanging them, discussing their ideas and their real plans. While there may be kitsch `` we are all stardust '' ... the character's reactions quickly correct any slippage from the reality of two young travelers infatuated with each other and with life. The scenes of Vienna, in the Prater amusement park, the clubs and especially the coffee scene, are extremely faithful to life. With so many trash made by American directors today it's nice to see a little gem like this.""",1

I was singing ""alleluia"" praise this DVD. Since we bought this DVD, it has only had 3 incidents in about 3 months. Although, we still have to remind her to use the potty, she is using the potty coherently. And to my surprise, there was a further advantage in watching this DVD as a family ... my 20-year-old started to want to use the potty too. He was not even 18 months old and was insisting on sitting on the potty and using it. So, I\'m saving money even on her diapers. It is not successful every time, but it is well on its way to the success of the toilets. She proudly wears her ""big"" underpants on her diaper, but she never would have done it any other way.

"b""It is quite difficult to review this film, as one has to take into account all the reasons why this film is doomed to fail miserably. First of all, this is the sequel to the film Interview With the Vampire (although the third book in the series). Since the second book in the series (The Vampire Lestat) had not been turned into a film, the producers of this film had to compact two history books in a film. This is one of the reasons why the film left out the majority of both books (read the books, by the way). Secondly, this film is the sequel to the very famous Inteview With the Vampire, so of course, repeating that formula would have been really impossible. One of the reasons is that the previous film was chosen by some great stars (Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas, Christian Slater), while Queen of the Damned was chosen with only one: Aalyiah. The rest of the cast was relatively unknown (Stuart Townsend is not widely known at the time). Apart from these problems, the film itself is rather horrible. If you've read the book, you'll be very disappointed, especially since much of Rice's rich characterization is lost. The story of none of the vampires is not revealed, in particular the legend of the twins, which is left completely out. The rest of the vampires is only glimpsed towards the end of the film and is never called by name. Unless you have read the book, you will not be able to tell who is who. Another idiot is that older vampires, for all their short screen time, wear the clothes of the era in which they were created, which is completely false in the book. Something that others might consider minor is the disappointing lack of physical resemblance that characters have with their counterparts in books. For example, Marius is described as a man in his forties, with long gray hair and a beautiful face. Jesse is much older in the book, with very prominent red hair, and Armand's brief appearance is definitely wrong, because it looks more like Lestat. The only correct thing about Armand's physical appearance is his age: he's much younger here than in Interview With the Vampire, because the books claim that Armand became a vampire when he was 17 years old. The only one who really looked close to his description is Lestat. Stuart Townsend looked a lot like my conception of Lestat, even though his voice was too deep. However, it did not look as good as Tom Cruise in that part. Physical resemblance is important because vampires are described as very sensual and beautiful, and the film suffers from not having accurately brought those literary characters to the life of the movies. I will not really start with the inaccuracies with the book; there were too many. The main liberties taken (besides the absence of the other vampires) were the relationship with Marius and Lestat. Lestat was not created by Marius, as others have pointed out, and Marius portrayed as something of an evil vampire, when in the book he is the mentor of Lestat and only kills evil men. The ending is completely different, and impossible to compare and contrast here (read the books). The main reason why I think it failed is that the film has sacrificed a rich history for the refractions of pop culture. More is made of the soundtrack of this film and of Lestat's short career as a nu-metal star of everything else, even of history. For the reasons I described at the beginning of this review, I think the directors were condemned to repeat the success of Interview With the Vampire, but it's no excuse not to make an effort. The producers try to apologize if for, especially with the cut scenes, where they try to explain why they cut more shots than the other vampires. In conclusion, Queen of the Damned is a miserable failure, especially for giving up a rich and compelling story for pop culture references. As I said, it would have been impossible to repeat the success of the former vampire film, but this film is simply too horrible to even support it.""",0
"b'I loved Saturday Night Fever when I saw it many years ago and it\'s still my favorite movie. A common misunderstanding is that it is a Disco film or a musical (like Grease). Saturday Night Fever is a hard face, sometimes raw and violent in the world of the young working class and in the club life of the \'70s (I was a bit too young at the time of Fever\'s release to enter the clubs, but it was similar in the pre-AIDS world of the early 80s when I started making clubs). Violence, sex and curses are REAL ... so it was (and kinda is ... sans the Bee Gee \') s that it is !!) for those in Brooklyn (and other places in New York). John Badham did a great job in putting the life of a late 19 year-old who lived for the disco Saturday night, causing everything else in his life to be frustrating and not going anywhere (remember the lines: ""Your cliche. your nothing ... on your way, no place? ""). It was the most powerful line and summarizes the life of Tony Manero. Serenade Fever is brutal, difficult and BIG! ! Up there with Taxi Driver for a representation of the raw character!'",1
"b""You would think that a film with such a famous cast could have some positive qualities, but not that. The characters are flat and do not provide any reason for the public to become emotionally attached. The character of Zeta-Jones enchanted and plump is terrible and sad, John Cusacks depressed and the solitary character is incredible and impossible to attack, Billy Crystal's agent who tries to please all the characters is not fun and engaging and the character of Julia Robert seems to be present only because she has a big smile. The highest point, if you can call it, is the alien lover character of Hank Azaria. His character is horribly stereotypical, but at least he does a little acting with an accent (even if the accent is excessive). Even Christopher Walken, who is good at everything, gets lost in this film. His small role as a filmmaker does not even make sense - there is nothing in the film to give directions to the ending in which the character of Walken plays an important role. The main point of the film - will Zeta - Jone's character and John Cusack's character come back together? - it is completely lost because they simply do not have a quantity of chemistry together on the screen. Their acting is completely flat. This film is disappointing even if compared to all the other bad romantic comedies. One last note: running Doberman could be fun and appropriate for the third grade if it were not for the fact that Crystal's character seems to enjoy being licked in the horse by a dog. He even tells the dog where to lick. It's not funny - it's just disturbing.""",0
"b""I thought this product was not useful. I would not buy it if you're not an experienced dancer or you're willing to spend a lot of time learning your dance moves. As with any workout I'm sure it increases your heart rate, but since there are so many moves I got frustrated and I put the DVD away from mere irritation. I never put it back in the DVD player after that. I prefer a workout that only has a bit of repetition, so I can learn the steps in a fairly short time, and actually get a workout on first use.""",0
"b'After purchasing all available copies of this film on the market, please take my advice - DO NOT BUTT! Obviously there is no decent copy of this film currently available. Being that it was originally produced by Samuel Goldwyn and published through United Artists, one could assume that MGM / UA Home Video could contain the original negatives (since they seem to have the rights to other Goldwyn films currently). The truth may be that there is no better version of this film, and this would be a real shame given its historical significance and the role it had in Soviet / US relations at the time it was made. But until the MGM Home Video will not release this title (If they ever do), save your dollars and download it for free from the Internet. Quality can not be worse.'",0

"b""We should all congratulate Uwe Boll. It's like some kind of cinematic cockroach. No matter how little talent he has, and no matter how ugly these films are, he manages to keep doing them. I know, he finances them all through a kind of bizarre German fund, but even so, his ability to continue making films despite complete and complete failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe. It would not be so bad if video game developers keep giving their best properties to this guy. I really liked the series of games Alone in the Dark. Even the last one, the New Nightmare, was good for a few hours of play. There was a good movie that had to be taken from the adventures of Edward Carnby, but that's not it. Now Uwe Boll has got his hands on Bloodrayne and Hunter: the Reckoning. What's next, Silent Hill? Fate? I can only imagine that this guy will cut the game-to-film adaptations if he's not stopped. Someone needs to take out his credit line, or these video game publishers have to know it and realize that when they make a bad movie from a game that kills the franchise, no one is more interested in that title. Think about it, House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark is a playable game title? There is no way . A new game House of the Dead comes out for XBox and nobody takes care of him. The title is dead, and all because of Uwe Boll. So if any of you out there work for a game publisher, or know a game publisher, or have access to a game publisher ... please let them know. This film itself is not even worth reviewing. I can not separate what I do not like about this pile of dung from the rest. Literally, everything about it sucks. Writing, acting, music, CG effects, editing. I thought if I waited until it came out on DVD and then rented it with low expectations, I would not be disappointed. Even the $ 5 you would spend on this DVD if you buy it used by one of the Amazon sellers is too much. You will regret it . This film is just a bunch of Boll.""",0

"b""Iggy's performance is exceptional, underlined by 5 Foot One, but what is really interesting is to listen to his interview with Tom Snyder. His front tooth is all faded, and he's a little disconcerted after running Dogfood, but it's a great interview. Hilarious, perspicacious and intelligent. Iggy's interview is a welcome gift after witnessing the painful talk with John Lydon, the typical John Lydon. Stupid, horribly rotten yellow teeth, grumpy, concise and difficult. No music from the GDP, however, just an interview. The Plasmatics have organized a fun show. At one point the guitarist crosses the audience and falls completely on an old man who probably did not realize what show he got the tickets. Another old lady has fingers in her ears. The plasmatic blow up a car. Wendy O turns out to be very sweet and rather shy during the interview with Snyder, the antithesis of her character on stage and in Reform School Girls (****). Movies are always good. They are not interviewed by Snyder, though. He was on vacation that week. The punk round table of '77 with Joan Jett, Paul Weller, Graham, etc. it's interesting to listen and see where the music went from there. Kim Fowley (the producer, manager, etc.) looks like a complete jacka $ $ but adds considerable entertainment to the whole discussion. Overall, the sound quality on this DVD is not spectacular. The bass is thin, and the vox often obscures the instruments, but the performance more than compensates for this. It is a journey of total nostalgia to watch the episodes in their entirety and is often exhilarating. Strange as some of the same arguments in today's media (violence in sport, economics, Ricky Schroeder) were the same stories they were talking about in the early 1980s.""",1
"b'Harvey Pekar\'s comic strip, American Splendor, paved the way for a new genre: the autobiographical comic book. At first glance, the daily events of a Cleveland archivist seem hardly the material for an interesting film. Fortunately, filmmakers Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman were able to take what was fun, excruciating and fascinating for Pekar\'s life and successfully adapt from the page to the big screen. Like Ghost World, American Splendor is an outsider champion who does not adapt to traditional society. In a touch of class, a mini-comic is accompanied by a DVD that briefly tells Pekar\'s experience of having his comic adapted in a film. The record itself presents an engaging audio commentary with the real Harvey Pekar, his wife Joyce, their daughter Danielle, his friend Toby Radloff, the directors Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman and the actor Paul Giamatti. Everyone has a lot of fun on this song while they are joking and remembering the film and their experiences. ""Road to Splendor"" is a brief update on what Harvey has done since the film was made. The song, ""American Splendor,"" by Eytan Mirsky that has been featured in the film can be heard in its entirety. His voices sound incredibly like Evan Dando of the Lemonheads. Finally, there is a theatrical trailer for the film. American Splendor has the same ironic sense of humor and melancholy as Ghost World, another excellent film adaptation of an independent comic strip. American Splendor remains faithful to Pekar\'s vision - he refuses to sentimentalize his life, even to the emotional end of the film that is truly moving. It is one of the best comic book adaptations ever made in a film because it stays true to its original material and wisely involves its creator in the process of transferring his story from page to screen.'",1
"b'The film is a strange animal, all right, a job without gender, and sometimes Gordon seems to have surpassed himself, grasping the effects he is unable to achieve. The various styles, moods and genres give the film a slightly amateurish and amateur look, but eventually (perhaps consciously from Gordon) this embarrassing work in favor of the film. The Singing Detective is an extraordinarily ingenious work, fresh and bold, almost childish in its lack of pretensions, and easily one of the most original American films of the last twenty years. Above all, it showcases Robert Downey Jr., the pulpy and afflicted psoriasis writer afflicted by Robert Downey Jr., in whose head (more or less) the entire film takes place, and Downey offers an inventive and powerful performance, which could being the apotheosis of his enormous talent Lode to Downey despite, at its release, Gordon\'s film has met a wall of critical resistance, a veritable consensus of contempt. This could be due in part (at least in the UK) to a passion for Potter\'s original TV series; but perhaps it depended even more on the basic incompatibility of Potter\'s idiosyncratic and scratchy vision with traditional (critical) tastes. In any case, the film once again failed tragically to find its audience. As with his previous adaptations, Gordon respected the original material without revering it and, as a director, has a rare gift: the ability to blend his sensitivity and talents with his subject on a fundamental level. In the case of The Singing Detective, it was a somewhat less homogeneous merger; Potter\'s vision (his bizarre blend of musical fantasy with distressing psychological realism) was so surprisingly original that he required another sensitivity at least as strong and eccentric as to melt. Gordon does not possess (yet) the surrealist gifts to make his vision Potter, or to take it to the next level (David Lynch could be the only director capable of doing it). He is a skilled director in every sense and seems to be blessed by a natural relationship with the actors (perhaps because so many good people want to work with him). Yet Gordon is not a visionary director, and this was a visionary script. Fortunately, he had a visionary actor on a career spike to resume the game, and Downey brings the day. The singer Detective is not a masterpiece; it is imperfect and fractured and sometimes thin, even easy and occasionally redundant (especially in the pseudo-noir sequences). But it is a piece of imaginative and fearless cinema, an admirably eccentric work that manages to do something like a brilliant writing. Full of inventive delights and sincere touches, it leaves most of the other recent American movies in the dust. Yet he flopped badly, both in the United Kingdom and the United States, being so poorly reviewed that many people (myself included) have given him a lack, wary of the stench of failure. As it happened, the bad smells did not come from the film, but from critics too corrupt and tired to recognize a work of art when they saw it.

"b""Seeing this musical on a New York stage is an unpleasant experience and I went to see it four times. But seeing it on film is a totally flat experience. It does not work on the screen for me. Even if you have a very talented cast, the incredible energy and electricity that have been smashed onto the stage are nowhere to be found. The musical is a sharp and gritty story based on the village's wet and rough environments, full of gritty people who live on the edge. Since I lived in New York for 30 years, I immediately felt at home with this hidden world that the average person can not imagine. But spending two hours in a cinema, watching this humid and depressing story, is an obscure experience. The musical numbers seem all forced. People are not very nice. They're all too dramatic and intense for their comfort zone and why the bombed movie is that Central America probably could not understand why the people in this movie did not pay the damned rent - and they avoid all the drama and problems! This film went very well in the big cities where there were people who could identify with this good-natured story of tragedy and AIDS. But even for someone like me who is very familiar with this world, which takes place in the Village, where I lived, it is a grim and depressing experience with very little to feel optimistic about. I could not sympathize with the junkies and prosties, nor did any of the electrified musical numbers. They had to have a new cast for the film version and open it more from the dark, always wet world that wraps this film.""",0
"b'""The Exorcist"" by William Friedkin is a point of reference. The cultural psyche is still shocked by its arrival on the scene over thirty years ago. It is a masterpiece that will continue to last long after many of today\'s horror movies have been forgotten. Actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) seeks help from father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) after daughter Regan (Linda Blair) starts acting strangely. After realizing that something is terribly wrong with the girl, Father Lankester Merrin (Max von Sydow) is summoned to conduct an exorcism on her. It follows a terrifying battle between the forces of good and evil that drives all the subjects involved in their physical and spiritual breaking points. Words can not effectively convey the power of ""The Exorcist"". \'\' This is a film that inexorably assault the senses and makes no excuse for doing so. The gender voices that followed had no choice but to follow his example because it redefined by itself what the audience intended to be cinematic horror. While Linda Blair deserves a lot of attention for her excellent work, the equally powerful performance of Jason Miller as Father Karras should not be overlooked. It gives the film an important human component that keeps it anchored. Without the Karras arch, ""The Exorcist"" is just another Scottish scream trying to make money quickly by relying on cheap chills. Truly revolutionary, ""The Exorcist"" is an extraordinary work that has dared to put the limits of cinema to the test. No serious discussion of the great cinema is complete without mentioning it.'",1

Sit back and wait to see if they go out (even if Part 1 was released a long time ago and there was a lot of time to produce a ""final version"")? If they never go out, we do not have a complete set of final editions - a real disappointment and a waste of money spent on the other six versions of the films.

"b""This performance of Ben Folds Five really made me a fan, it's really amazing how many non-musical styles and sounds can come out of only three musicians. I have to admit that I only knew the song & quot; Brick & quot; but this was reason enough to buy this DVD and give it a chance and to my surprise every song here is FANTASTIC! the image and the sound quality are perfect and the performance is enough to make an instant fan from anyone.

"b""WOW. This film has been so stimulating for some reasons. One, it was a quality, uplifting film about an African-American father - so rare to see in the film. Secondly, he reassured me and I hope, that just because I complain for a long time, this does not make me unusual. Much of what this father has illustrated in pain, I'm struggling with. It was so refreshing not to have heard the name of God trashed in this film, as seems to be the norm by the actors these days. Very powerful . Thanks Amazon.""",1
"b'This 90-minute DVD of PBS is a bit \'false, but it is still a good performance. The WCTE WC station in Cookeville, TN, has recorded a series of concerts in the Cumberland Caverns ""Volcano Room"", 333 feet below ground level. The DVD collects excerpts from performances by 10 musicians or bands that are best included in the ""Americana"" title. Some are those that can best be described as ""bluegrass"", including the well-known Ricky Skaggs and the family group Cherryholmes. The singer and composer Darrell Scott and the son of Steve Earle Justin Townes Earle (both those I love) are better classified as ""Americans"". The young band 18 South mixes country and bluegrass, while Will Hoge is closer to rock than any other. Based on both the appearance and the song it plays, I imagine that - although this DVD is dated 2011, the JT Earle clip was recorded about four years ago. I could not identify the others. The performances have been recorded with a live audience and it is a bit \'impeccable to see the rocks of the Caverns in the background, but since the musicians are so well microphones, I\'m not sure it makes the sound better or different. There are no real presentations; the performer is identified by a title on the screen. So there is no filler here. I loved seeing artists I know and love (if you\'ve never seen the blackest Black Gospel singer - Mike Farris - this is your chance!) But I\'ve also discovered some new ones. for one - I\'d like to see a sequel to this DVD. I hope you have found this informative and useful review. See Ramm ""Anything Phonographic""'",1
"b""There are those who criticize JFK, claiming that Oliver Stone ignored the facts and rewrote the story. True or not, this completely misses the point. Stone himself said that his intention in making the film was to get his audience to question authority and to think for itself. The film is presented as a POSSIBLE explanation (a combination of two separate theories) for unusual events leading to Kennedy's assassination, and actually raises more questions than it answers. The cast is phenomenal. The award winning cinematography and editing are nothing short of revolutionary. Despite your opinion on the JFK policy, the film is one of the very few that I would dare to say perfect. That's why I'm a director, and it's worth every second that I look at it. You will never forget it.""",1

"b'First of all I want to inform you that I\'m a big fan of Recess. So this comes from a fan\'s perspective. Do you really want to know what it is? This is like the DVD ""Miracle on Third Street"" with which the real stories are held together. There are 4 real stories (3 TV episodes already seen) and only a new episode of 13 minutes. It begins when TJ and his gang return to the old abandoned playground at the back of the playground and are captured by kindergartens. They are held ""hostage"" by the new boss called Chief Stinky and the band tries to tell him stories about their experiences with kindergartens and then, finally, Gus tells when the band was a kindergarten (the new episode). The three episodes already seen are ""The Legend of Big Kid"", ""Wild Child"" and ""The Kindergarten Derby"". \'\' Bonus DVD episodes titled \'Fans\' 3 Favorite Episodes\' are: The Challenge, The Story of Whomps and One Stayed Clean. * I doubt they are the most favorite because I know that ""The Experiment"" is very popular with fans because it is when TJ and Spinelli are kissing for the first time. Even if you wonder why Gus is on the cover when he allegedly entered Third Street in 4th grade. Well in the DVD, Gus went to Third Street during Kindergarten but only for a couple of weeks and only he remembers the kindergarten while the rest of the band does not remember a thing of that year that explains why Gus is on the cover. You will notice that the voices of TJ and Mikey are different (not too different or annoying but it is noticeable) because the voices of the original voice actors had become too deep. However, when I bought this DVD, I thought it would be an hour long adventure in history when TJ and the band were kindergarten children ... but unfortunately it was not. It was really pathetic for Disney to do it and to give such a neglected episode of ""already seen on TV"" episodes. I only gave 2 stars due to the new episode. If you bought ""Miracle on Third Street"" and were disappointed, I do not think you want it. If you are a new fan, and you have not seen all the episodes ... then this is a fantastic DVD to discover! If you are a parent and consider this as a simple whimisical fun for your child, I HIGHLY recommend this, but much more because the DVD and the episodes are hilarious but they can also have powerful good messages of friendship and believe in yourself, and so on . I know that most guys like this because even my younger cousins \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b(about 8-12 years old) like the cartoon and can relate to the characters with them at school. I hope this helps you guys out!'",0
"b""Dumas's stories have been filmed so often, but it's still a joy to see them. This new version of the Count of Monte Christo is no exception. It has serious flaws and errors, too numerous to list. For example: modern lines of language, absolutely incredible interpretations (like other reviewers mentioned), very amateur characterizations (the Count twirls his locks and his old love recognizes him by the gesture rather than by his almost unchanged looks). None of these things really disgusted me. I just sat and enjoyed myself. The opening scene created a mood and photography generally showed optimal settings. The end was unbelievably mushy, but since I had just seen a fight / fencing scene with a green setting, I did not really care. A strong complaint about most of the new films: the voices are almost incomprehensible compared to the background music and noises. I hope you will read the book if you have not already done so. No film has ever made the story of Dumas that told the justice of power. The version of The Three Musketeers with Michael York as d'Artagnan approached. If you want to be just entertained, this film can adapt to your mood. I've seen it three times now.""",1
"b'Breakdown is a terrifying film that enters the most fearful fears of our time, joyfully and perhaps sardonically, representing what happens when we discover that our $ 50,000 sport utility vehicle is not enough to protect us from all the disgusting and disgusting people that are out there in the world just waiting to kick us in the face. Kurt Russell is Jeff Taylor and his wife, Amy (Kathleen Quinlan), have pulled up the roots in Massachusetts to move the country through the driving method. After talking to a redneck truck driver because their jeep breaks in the Utah desert, the terrifying fun begins. Just like in Spielberg\'s Duel, malevolence comes in the appearance of a big truck. The truck driver named Red (JT Walsh) agrees to give Amy a ride to the nearest public phone while Jeff stays with the car. Now, it\'s easy to wonder why in the world Jeff would leave his wife riding with a total stranger in an 18 wheeler, but put yourself in the same situation and you\'d probably do the same thing. One goes to ask for help, the other to stay with the car. Amy disappears, does not show up at Belle\'s Diner, where she should have met with Jeff. Customers have never seen it. And when Jeff chases Red\'s rig, Amy is nowhere to be found. Worse, Red claims he never saw Jeff before his life. What now happens is ""find the wife"". ""What an incredible thrill that gives the entire cast, especially Russell who is nervous, ready to enter the hatchery husband who left his wife to lose the grip of his loving hand on that lonely highway when a handsome trucker said,"" Come with me , Can I help you. \'\' Russell discovers an incredible performance as the obsessed husband who leaves his wife to escape.

"b""Robocop 2 is probably the sequel to the most underrated and harshly criticized story (linked to Predator 2, released the same year). Due to some elements missing from the first and a slightly more comic-like approach to violence, critics and the public were not happy and the opinions and feelings towards the franchise were crushed with the simple and terrible Robocop 3. Do not forget a good movie though. Robocop 2 still has the same wild sense of humor, cynical social comment and character pathos of the first film. It is a hyper-realist vision of an America populated by gun-loving psychotropic drugs, a democracy owned by big businesses and drug-dependent poverty treated by street vendors who believe they are the second coming of Christ. It may seem improbable to be the typical way to describe it. Completely-over-the-top would be more appropriate. Empire Strikes Back director Irvin Kershner attacks the most sadistic violence, the deafening shots, the endless destruction and loss of human life that the film begs you not to take it seriously. Some of the faults have been attributed to the writer Frank Miller because the film was more cartoon than the original. I do not think it's very right. I read Miller's original screenplay when I was in high school and is quite different and, I dare say, adamant. Robocop 2 himself was not Nuke Lord Caine, the psychotic hippie with delusions of divinity. His name was Kong, a psychotic policeman who practically killed everyone he met. Sergeant Reed and the Elder died and there was not much humor. Screenwriter Walon Green was hired to take care of the screenplay and much of what appears on the screen is actually his work. Frank Miller's original ideas are practically gone as a frame for the entire film and part of his story has been recycled into Robocop 3 (do not blame it for that either). Miller was obviously troubled by this, but it was still a good enough sport to appear in the film (keep an eye on it while playing Dr. Frank), even though he swore not to work in Hollywood anymore for fear of being exploited. Until Robert Rodriguez has not promised to remedy his graphic novels of Sin City. Verhoven may have gone away, but Irvin Kershner strives to offer the same mix of joy and magic and actually manages to do it well. Even the soundtrack of Basil Poledouris is gone (returns to Robocop 3) but the new composer Leonard Rosenman creates a wonderfully heroic and optimistic theme that fits the film more than the tormented and tormented mood of Poledouris at the first.Filmed again in Texas In Houston this time, you really have to try for Peter Weller to go around in that Robosuit. He must have weighed a ton and taken care of buckets inside. There is a scene in particular in the film in which Murphy is tortured in a near-death / destruction situation that is very difficult to watch. But it leads him to get a brand new renewal and those crazy new directives put in the head. The piece he teaches to the Little League boys and scolds young people playing with fire hydrant (after mentioning a very suspicious philosophy) is exhilarating. Robocop 2 is a great movie. Despite the problems with the script and the story and some stop-motion effects a bit 'dated, is a brilliant sequel up to expectations. Listen to the no-sayers. I do not know what kind of film they expected. And thanks for not smoking! The DVD is in 1.85: 1 anamorphic widescreen with amazing colors (look at the chrome of Robo's armor) and Dolby 5.1 sound. I'm a little sad that there are no extras like a comment, because I really would like to hear what Kershner has to say about the film. And there are deleted scenes that I know Murphy has visited his grave and some other details about why Caine is so strange. Oh good. One can only hope that in the future ...""",1
b'Do not miss out on the first two reviews Amazon has posted on this page. This DVD is the authorized release and the quality is fantastic.',1
"b'This 30th Anniversary Edition takes the original movie Night of the Living Dead and throws a new soundtrack and new scenes. As far as I\'m concerned, the original film was perfect as it is and this was not necessary, however I decided to be open and give this edition a chance considering that the new material was written by John Russo (who co-wrote the original film) and has Hinzman\'s photography (and acting) (which also helped to create the original). I was completely disappointed. The new scenes include a new introduction, various scenes of zombies marching and killed by redneck and a new epilogue. The various scenes sometimes interfere with the flow of the film, the trick is less effective and some of the new extras are terrible. They do a pretty decent editing job in the new scenes, but they are still obvious (for example, the fads are not entirely correct). The new introduction and the epilogue are ridiculous. The intro simply states that the leading zombie (played by Hinzman) was a criminal when he was alive. This detracts from one of the film\'s most effective elements: that the zombies could be your neighbor or a close friend or relative, but they will continue to try to kill you. Hinzman is obviously older in frontal shots (the profiles are okay). When he starts attacking two gravediggers, one of the ""actors"" starts to run away and realizes that Hinzman would have to grab him first, so he actually returns to the coffin and bends down so Hinzman can grab him! ! ! The fact that they have not made a second recovery shows a lack of attention. The epilogue is a ""a year later"" interview with a mad hellish sulfur elf who survived the carnage. It\'s stuck in the middle (spoilers warning) of the scene where Duane Jones is killed and the credits that show the rednecks that eliminate his body! ! It\'s about interfering with a very effective ending! You can watch the original cut (on an excellent print), but you can watch it only with the new soundtrack! The old soundtrack was made up of library music, but it worked excellently. In the best case, the new soundtrack is mediocre. Sometimes it does not even adapt to the mood of the scene, for example being frenetic when the action is more seductive and depressive. The booklet contains interviews composed mainly of actors who speak of how ""impeccable"" the new scenes have been added and how many fans of the old ones will love the new (wrong) version. There is a hint of funny comments, but you get the same people (plus others, including Romero) who give the same information about the songs of the comments in the much larger Elite Millennium Edition.'",0
"b'I wanted so much to enjoy this film. I kept hoping that somehow it would ""resume"" and get up again. Unfortunately he never did, and he actually just started a bizarre nothing somewhere in the middle. Basically it is a cynical paranormal writer who stays in a hotel room where all kinds of bad things happen over the years. Really? That\'s all. Still, there was so much to work in history. It could have been deeper, the plot more involved. The characters could have been much more than them. This film is an interweaving of loose ends, mostly nebulous, that never bind. It moves at the rhythm of snails and expects something that never happens. The finish is incredible and contrived. However, the special effects are very good.'",0
"b'This film is a total joke! Think of the poster that is full of action and surprising as ""underworld"" or ""Resident Evil"". NOT! ! The actors were very slow with the fighting scenes (as if they were practicing) and the dialogues were stupid. Talented waste for Ben Kingsley (who is always good as we all know). You can not say if the setting is in England or the United States because the actors can not decide with their accents. Waste of money and time ..'",0

"b'I was very disappointed with how far this film is from the real story! He is ""approximately"" Prince Caspian, but lacks many important elements. The first is that they left Aslan almost entirely until the end. Those familiar with the book will remember that Aslan is the most important part of the strength and development of history. It was he who called the children in Narnia for his purpose a plan. Half of the book talks about Aslan and the children, so the fact that they have left their importance outside the film really ruins the story. No Aslan, no Narnia! There are a number of other aspects that do not stick to the book, but some of these could be more easily overlooked if they had not moved away from the true ""heart"" of the story. The other big disappointment for me was how altered Peter\'s character. His whole attitude has changed. You never have the chance to warm it up and in the end I\'m almost glad it will not come back to Narnia. (The same can be said for Susan.) The plot seemed very weak, and the relationship they were trying to create between Caspian and Susan was completely superfluous and I felt, helped a lot to ruin the film. But if you are not interested in the loyalty of the plot, ""Prince Caspian"" by Andrew Adamson is an adventure full of action with many wonderful visual and special effects. However, I highly recommend you read the story. The book has much more wealth and purpose. I wish they had stayed true to this story as they had ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"". I hope they will do better at ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"". We\'ll see ... ! These are just some of my thoughts. Needless to say, I feel like they could have done this much better.'",0
"b'I first saw the Stallone version of this film. I must say that I did not hate him and I liked the music and the girl who played his talent. But then I looked for and found the original with Michael Caine. This film is far superior to the ""Rocky"" movie. This has become a favorite of mine and I think one of the best shows by Michael Caines. Surely it still resists today. It\'s violent, without excuses and just a damn good crime revenge movie.'",1
"b'Great movie. . . good actors. . . I love the European feeling for the film and Matt Damon actually looks sexy.

They are simply too different.'",1

"b'This documentary is total BS. The facts and opinions are totally wrong. I doubt anyone who was responsible for this even read a single book on Gettysburg. Heth troops opened the battle, not Early\'s.Little Roundtop was the most important battle of the second day, not that of Culp. ""Saving the Union"". In fact, Grant\'s victory at Vicksburg did much more to end the Civil War than the Battle of Gettysburg. If Meade had lost there he would have retreated to Washington\'s impenetrable defenses and would have waited for Grant\'s army to push Lee away from the district. I read in many books on Gettysburg that Lincoln was livid that Meade did not follow the battle by Lee persuasive. Their statements about a ""discovery"" of a handwritten telegram on this and subsequent opinions were absurd. In fact these four ""facts"" are just the beginning. The related material was also silly. Avoid this trash.'",0
"b""This is one of those rare films that completely capture teenage girls in a fun and honest way. Enid and Rebecca are two misfits who have just graduated from high school. While Rebecca finds a job trying to get her apartment and move on into adulthood, Enid is still struggling to find her place in a new world. This is evident from his reluctance to find a job and move forward. After joining a lonely old man, she somehow ends up becoming her friend as she walks away from Rebecca. Enid is a character you get angry at sometimes but at the same time you understand that she has difficulty moving forward in life and feeling empathy for. He is very talented but has no idea what exactly he wants to do. So he turns to the marginalized like the old fool who is sitting waiting for a bus that never comes and the old Seymour. This film is often sad but also hilarious. You're always wondering where this movie will take you. Even the end is the perfect touch even if someone might not care. It's a great movie that is actually real and honest. These are not characters cut out of cardboard, these are real girls. In conclusion, the buzz is worth it. You'll like it if you like smart, independent movies that are not invented and actually have real meaning. Brilliant!""",1

"b'Interview With A Vampire was an excellent film, beautifully crafted based on an incredible idea. Queen Of The Damned illustrates if nothing else than Anne Rice is a wonderfully creative author, but I discovered that this film version of one of her books was very boring with lots of very thin characters thrown in. Vampire Lestat (played wonderfully by Stuart Townsend) decides to get out of retirement which is actually a sleep of several hundred years. It gives a great vision of the world of vampires - you know hates light, garlic and all holy things; love the darkness, the attractive necks of young women and the eerrr `` Nu-Metal! ""But what annoys him the most is that he\'s immortal, I mean he does not age at all, he seems to have unlimited financial resources - yet he\'s so bored with life, he seems like a spoiled vampire! the other vampires then maybe they will become so angry that they put him out of this eternal suffering - and who better than work then the ""Queen of the Damned"" - or Aaliyah for us How he manages to provoke them and she - well, becomes the lead singer of the band Nu - World\'s biggest and most controversial media ... Hey, I\'d definitely be in touch with all the other vampires ... There are interesting aspects of this film: how he became a vampire and how he dealt with this is quite fascinating. and typical gothic images.The monologue of his thoughts is full of comic irony and is delivered in a wonderful \'dead-pan\' way. sonages are also hilarious. Aaliyah looks stunning in her role as the queen of all vampires - she really has a presence on screen and what a tragedy her career as an actress and musician has been interrupted. Even the conflicts between vampires and vampires that continue in the film are quite original. Unfortunately none of the effects are particularly spectacular. Overall, although the idea is good, the development and the plot are too weak to make this film truly memorable.'",0
"b'This is a 70s horror movie based on the bestseller book of the ""real"" story of a haunted house on Long Island. It has been debunked and shown to be a total fiction, but the film generated a dozen sequels and also the necessary remake. The Lutz family buys the home of their dreams only to find out that it is haunted and also contains the passage to Hell in the basement. Yes, it is completely and absolutely overwhelming to think that if such a passage existed in something called Hell, it would be in Amityville, on Long Island. James Brolin plays her husband, a tough man with a lot of hair. Margot Kidder is his wife, who can react with big and big eyes every time he witnesses a ghost, a hallucination, an atrocity, etc. Most of the fears are really opening doors or something, looking at something, and then the music gets really loud, and then we see people\'s eyes, closer, and then, da-da! A special effect of cheese. Good for the value of nostalgia. The appearance of Rod Steiger as a crazy priest is an important advantage. As an economic exorcist. If these types of movies scare you, it might be worth it on a slow night. Also good for some involuntary laughter.'",0

"b""The war against humanity is at its peak. The planet Roku San is at its hardest point. With the military support waning, the soldiers die every day and with new insects that are constantly revealed to the world, how will humanity survive, if not without you? The Federation is currently looking for men and women to fight this terror. How would you like to be a hero, and how would you like to become a citizen while you are there? Would you like to know more ? STARSHOOP TROOPERS as a series has become infamous, if only because the second film did not contribute to the plot of the first film. With little hope in mind, I started looking at STARSHOOP TROOPERS: MARAUDER in the hope that, somehow, it would be better than the second, and perhaps as good as the first. Unfortunately the disappointment takes the reins and brings me back a step with STARSHIP TROOPERS 3. Set on planet Roku San and following our original hero, Johnny Rico, the film soon proved to have little hope when we learn about some of his characters . Johnny Rico, experienced in his new years in the military, has always been known not to follow orders, but in the case of death? Is the sky marshal one of the most famous men on earth a pop star? And the soldiers who, normally, would not have become struck stars, are in love in the presence of the singer of the heavens, often to the point of completely disobeying orders and ignoring the external threat? What happens to the series, if not a total cheese factor? Unfortunately, this does not stop soon. With a plot that mainly follows an offcast, the actress of Angelina Jolie, named Jolene Blalock, while leading a small group of individuals in the Roku San desert, the film ends up falling into an exaggerated attempt at a science fiction movie. PRO: - Some actors. Jolene Blalock played her character extremely well, as did Marnette Patterson as Holly Little. I must also give the man who played Johnny Rico credit for contributing to this film. I do not know how much they paid him, but I hope enough to substantiate his time playing a very bad, very underdeveloped film. The long and long list of disadvantages: CONS: - The CGI. Since the first film was released in 1997, it was incredibly disappointing that the CGI was so bad. Given the progress in computer graphics technology, one might think that a film would at least live up to standards like its 1997 counterpart. No - it was not. There is no more need to think about it anymore.- The acting. Most of the acting was full of poor actors and actresses. Emphasized, not mentioned, not emphasized at all - I found very few of the actors who deserve to be watched. I could not help but shudder at the way some of them played their characters, and by the way, many of them were portrayed. The military men and women do not follow what, as individuals, they would think that, marshals and officers order troops around in senseless and senseless ways, and soldiers throw themselves on insects that explode when they can simply retreat to the back of the room. Value is not even a problem here - its stupidity that takes its toll. - Cheese. Yes, I specifically mentioned cheese, if only because it is very important in this film. Sky Marshals as popstars, soldiers are told they will be shot if they ask for an autograph, then trying to ask for an autograph, high-ranking Federation officials will not bother to draw a gun when they are mercilessly beaten, then try to arrest a soldier for removing the assailant - there is not a trivial action in this film, because there is no shortage of stupidity that comes with the cheese factor. In all, I could not help wondering what exactly happened to this film. STARSHIP TROOPERS 2 was a disappointment for itself, but three? ... it's awful . It is better than 2, if only because it follows the plot and construction of the world of the former, but does not make it anyway a film worthy of being seen. STARSHIP TROOPERS tricerates should be dead after the first one is done. MARAUDER should quickly die a slow and horrible death, if only because it blurs the original to the point of disappointing. I was thrilled to see him, despite the warnings that many of my friends gave me. Surely I will not watch a quarter in this film. If I start trying too, I'll remember how horrible they are two and three, then I push the first movie into the DVD player, if only because the first one will always be the only good movie from STARSHIP TROOPERS.""",0
"b""This film could have been much better, but they just had to ruin it, right? With the exception of the very refined performances of Denzel Washington, Ed O'Neill and Queen Latifah, the rest of the film has just fallen. The plot seems so ridiculous that I can not help but look elsewhere. Angelina Jolie's acting is below average, but she did her best. The end of the twist was not very disappointing, but it fell flat because of its exaggerated (or lack of) suspense. I did not really like watching this thriller. There are better ones like Se7en and The Usual Suspects. Look at those two, and you'll see what a real thriller should be like. Degree: D +""",0
"b""I loved this film as a kid, so I thought about buying the DVD. I saw a review of the image quality that is very bad, but I went ahead and bought it anyway. I thought that a slightly scratchy print would have been better than a videotape used with a rotating image. I was not able to understand how I could be wrong. It almost seems like they hit this copy from a print of a mutated 16mm projector. The printout has an incorrect damage to the pinion which causes the image to shake on the screen. It seems they used the light bulb from a simple oven to cook this print. Calling the muddy picture would be a compliment. All life and color have been sucked into this film. I said the film was not even focused. Even the sound was pretty bad, but I'm not much of an audiophile to really talk about it. Do yourself a favor and look for the VHS version. It can not be worse than this copy. Or could it? : - (""",0
"b'Always passionate about this program, I was deeply disappointed to see that Sony did not actually ""restore"" the film as claimed. The film print used for video transfer is scratched and full of specifications, `` fuzz \'\' etc. As many reviewers have noted, even the soundtrack is nothing to write about. Actually, it\'s better to have an old VHS version of the program used, as the ""bonus"" features of this DVD re-release are insignificant (no ""creation of"" features, interviews or anything like that). Surely a program so loved deserves a real restoration using the original materials (if any) for both the film and the soundtrack.'",0

"b""This is one of my favorite film noir films, a great film in which Welles showed the world that he could make a classic Hollywood film without exceeding the budget and still producing a genuine and personal masterpiece. I own two other previously released transfers of this public domain film, none of which rendered justice to the film. They look like worn VHS tapes. I'm so bad. Finally, although without extras and with a relatively high price, MGM has released what appears to be a transfer from an excellent original 35mm print, if not the original negative. The image looks very clean and crisp, with deep blacks, and I can finally enjoy the film as Welles intended. Buy it.""",1
"b'Coleman Silk (Anthony Hopkins) is a respected dean and university professor. After an innocent remark is misinterpreted as a racist comment, he is forced to leave his job in disgrace. Coleman begins a strange relationship with a nonsuccessful woman (Nicole Kidman) who is half her age, who has had a tragic past and is not ready to return her love. For me, this strange little film was condemned from the beginning, when the big finish is shown right away. The rest of the story is shown in noisy and anti-climactic flashbacks (often out of order) that did not allow any accumulation of tension or sympathy for the main character, Coleman. As a young man from New Jersey, he is played by Wentworth Miller who is rather charismatic and likeable, but did not resemble Coleman, an adult with a Welsh accent (who sometimes seemed to channel a leonizing Hannibal Lector). Hopkins is so horribly disgusted in this role that it is impossible to buy the loathsome plot. Kidman also completely wrong for this film; his innate grace and elegance could not be hidden by a messy hairstyle and I had never bought it as an illiterate custodian. His graphic love scenes with Hopkins were more gruesome than romantic. There is a personal tragedy among the main characters - including Gary Sinise, who plays a troubled writer and Ed Harris as a Vietnam veteran - yet the film is completely dishonest and I have not felt connected to them or the whole premise of injustice . Later, I was left shaking my head for this amazing mess of a film and I was simply amazed by the fact that so much talent could not save it.'",0
"b'& quot; Coffy & quot; (1973) made Pam Grier a star, & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; (1974) clearly shows why Grier became a star. & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; it simply distils the stellar qualities of Grier and uses them to their full potential, and for stellar qualities, I do not refer only to its broad bosom. In & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; Grier is a mad woman raped and raped for revenge at all costs, does not just chew the landscape, destroys it. But that\'s exactly why we love Grier. She is beautiful, sensual and she can kick a whole ass! As for me, she is the original action heroine of the screen and this vehicle shows her talents as an action star. Unlike & quot; Coffy, & quot; & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; he does not give Grier many chances to flex his reciting muscles, but he presents Grier dirty and dirty: Foxy loots apartments, beats hostile lesbians, hurts his eyes, burns alive men, summons (literally and figuratively), and also takes out weapons from the fire of his perfectly bandaged afro. & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; it is filthy, savagely sadistic, absolutely exaggerated and a cult classic of cinema for these reasons. & quot; Coffy & quot; it could be the best movie, but & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; it\'s more pleasant So, how do you & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; to do on DVD? Well, the record is an absolute revelation. Not since the theatrical debut of the film seemed so beautiful. The previous full frame transfer used for videotape and laserdisc was atrocious, characterized by icteric complexions, excessively saturated colors, dark and dark interiors, ruined compositions and excessively accentuated edges. The new widescreen transfer, improved anamorphically, is bright. The compositions are correctly conserved with proportions of 1.85: 1, no more the distraction margin and some information on the image is added to the sides. The interiors now reveal wood paneling, earth-colored wallpaper and brown curtains, unlike the previous transfer that made almost everything black or dark brown. The flesh tones are finally natural and the colors of the film are reduced to a level of understandable saturation, but do not worry, the fashions of the \'70s are still a brilliant kaleidoscope of tawdriness. The sharpness is pleasant; the improvement of the margins never makes a bad head and the skies of the sky are finally blue. Go is the olive and yellow light. The film grain is visible in some dark scenes and there are some defects of origin. Considering that this is a low-budget exploitation film made in 1974, the element of origin is almost untouched. The compression on the disk is not so pristine, however. Some dark and dark areas are often prone to tiling artifacts, but for a retail price of only $ 14.95, who can complain? The supplements include the entertaining theatrical trailer (""Foxy has no liver: no ifs and and buts!"" And an illuminating commentary by director Jack Hill who repeatedly describes the labors of working with AIP (American International Pictures) on this film, which he said is It was one of its worst cinematographic experiences.The monophonic sound on the record is commendable, the dialogue is always intelligible and the bass level makes the soundtrack of Willie Hutch just as funky as it was 27 years ago Jack Hill created Pam Grier his sub-genre with ""Coffy"" and ""Foxy Brown"" and when he left after ""sad"" 1976 ""Friday Foster,"" nobody took his place ... no one ever. "" Foxy Brown ""is the latest action vehicle Pam Grier, a classic blaxploitation and a great DVD! If you\'ve only seen"" Foxy Brown ""on videotape or laserdisc, you have not seen"" Foxy "" at all.'",1
"b""This film is about a million times better than the recent `` Red Dragon` remake. '' The real conflict in the film is Will's tenuous hold (William Petersen) on his sanity while he keeps track of a killer about to hit while dealing with a killer he has already captured. While Brian Cox's Lecktor will draw comparisons with Anthony Hopkin's version in subsequent films, Cox plays the psychopath as a real threat: a killer who will kill. Even Hopkins is brilliant, but I always thought his reader was like an animal that would only hit provocatively. We see Cox and Petersen side by side on different sides of the fence, with few elements separating them from the knowledge of right and wrong on the part of Petersen. This thriller is one of the best.""",1
"b'I\'ve been a longtime follower of Smallville, and every year there are always fans (myself included) that touch the current year as ""Jump the Shark"". If you browse through my profile you will find that my reviews of the old seasons begin with enthusiasm and become more critical with the passing of the years. While I will not comment on the season 8 on the air, the trend seems to be true when you compare season 7 with the previous six: I am a pure genius compared to this mess. There\'s too much to do about this year. Smallville always has great comic stories, but lacks development and internal logic in his world. The writers jump from one plot to another without rhythm, so you get dramatic and seemingly dramatic events that are completely forgotten by the next episode. There is a shocking turn that involves the new Daily Planet Editor that is interrupted when it becomes interesting; the return of Clark\'s biological mother, Lara, hardly suffers an episode; Bizzaro appears and is promptly defeated - twice; Clark travels through time and space to save his infantile self on Krypton in all five minutes. Sam Jones definitely returns as Pete Ross and is wasted in a horrible product positioning. The Supergirl is introduced and just developed before being saddled with the clich\xc3\xa9 of amnesia and disappears for most of the season. Why not settle for 2 or 3 plots and develop them properly? And do not blame the writer\'s strike, which cuts this 2-episode season - the problems were obvious before the strike took place. Speaking of external influences, some characters leave the show this year. The sudden departure of Kristen Kreuk to film Street Fighter leaves a rather anemic goodbye to her already weak character - thankfully she will return briefly in season 8 to equalize the parties. Another character that I do not want to ruin dies of a noble death and we will miss him. It\'s the start of Rosenbaum which is the real kicker, though. Not only does not the best actor in Smallville return, but he is left with an ambiguous and unsatisfactory ending. Hardly an excellent capper for 7 years of overtime. There are some things that Smallville does just this year - the return of Brainiac and the plot of \'Veritas\' bring a sense of continuity that the show has been seriously lacking. But overall, there\'s a lack of consistency that seasons 5 and 6 tried to have, and the show no longer has a heart now that Kent\'s parents have left. Whether you need this season or not depends on whether you bought the first six and absolutely want the complete collection.'",0

The chemistry between Nicholson and Freeman was incredible and they performed beautifully. Humor was a welcome relief for the immense emotional matter. This film made me reflect on what is important in life. I found many of the key themes in the film something to think about and consider about my life. I loved the pyramid questions: 1. Did you find joy in your life? 2. Did you bring joy to the lives of others? This film is probably not what you need to achieve when you're in the mood for something carefree and fun. However, if you want to recover some perspective on what is important in life, this film does a good job of making you reflect on what you want to accomplish in life - especially without being a preacher.""",1

"b'""Alias"" is one of my favorite programs, although weaker was excellent compared to almost all other TV shows. The fifth season, while reinventing the show again, is very fun, exciting and exciting, and I recommend anyone to watch it. However, I have serious serious problems with this version of DVD. Actually I do not own it, because I bought the complete collection of Rambaldi boxes by far superior (all five seasons Alias \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bin one). But I saw the fifth season and it\'s terrible. Of all the five versions of DVD, it\'s the ugliest box. The promotional photo is horrible, the green cover does not go well with the other seasons and the big words ""FINAL SEASON"" are simply tacky. The box is now the same size as the other versions, it is what looks less than half an inch thick. This was a big problem for me too, with Alias \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b- Buena Vista changing the package for each season. It is very annoying. Furthermore, the special features are nothing. Some interesting features, but overall the supplements are very weak for the final season. The whole thing feels rushed and messed up, as if no one had ever felt that this was the last season of a much-loved series. If you can afford it, I highly recommend you invest in the complete collection. It is very well done and put together (even if it has its flaws) and has a bonus disc of extras that are very informative and fun to watch. However, only 40,000 have been made so that supplies are limited.'",0

"b'""L\'Affaire du Collier"" can be based on a true story, but it is also a fascinating historical love story, ""The Queen\'s Necklace"", by Alexandre Dumas, who certainly had more than the ""Three Musketeers"". ""In his sleeve, Dumas tells the identical story of Joseph Balsamo (called Conte Cagliostro), Jeanne de la Motte Valois, the lascivious but charming Cardinal de Rohan and the great diamond scam, even if the film producers give no credit to Dumas (I know the book is available on Amazon.com, and I highly recommend it!) The costume designer, Malena Canonero, deserves plaudits for the strips of silks, satins and lace that beautifully recreate the opulence of the 18th century court century of Louis XVI.The settings are beautiful too, but I have found a lot of music out of tune, as the composer has insisted on giving it a modern rhythm at times, and has also used a mixture of Mozart\'s ""Requiem"", among others. I find such cuts and rearrangements of a bar here, a bar there, to be both lazy and a bit of a cheat In the featurette, the director explained that he wanted to make the period ""accessible"" to the modern public. not just insult to the intelligence of the modern public but also weakens the film. Because the story is so strong, I still enjoyed the movie. I was particularly impressed by Jonathan Pryce\'s interpretations of the soave Cardinal, Adrien Brody as the unscrupulous husband of Jeanne and Simon Baker, who is particularly engaging as his love interest. All of them are credible and move well in their thirst. Although Hilary Swank is an excellent actress, I thought she was uncomfortable in this role. She looks a little uncomfortable in her costume and moves more like a twenty-first-century woman than an eighteenth. Apart from these reservations, I will keep this film and no doubt will watch it again.'",1

"b'I generally do not use the space for product reviews to comment on the conditions of a particular item or to draw attention to a less than respectable buyer. In this case, however, I will make an exception. The DVD that I received today, sold through Amazon LLC, the one listed as ""Passport to Pimlico"" (Remastered Edition), is obviously a work done at home. The external label is a color photocopy, the one on the DVD is in black and white, for heaven\'s sake. Turn the DVD upside down and you can clearly see the band that the home recording produces on a recordable DVD. The manufacturer, A2ZCDs, appears to be a professional complete, with a meaningful catalog, a good-looking website etc. But I\'m not sure why this sale was not listed as coming from a third-party vendor. (At least its origin from Amazon makes it easier to return.) But more significantly, is the production of DVDs at home simply not illegal? Does this not constitute piracy? My hypothesis when I read the word ""remastered"" is that the print is made by an existing negative, or significantly cleaned up; I certainly expect that the studio, the directors or at least the historians of the cinema have a certain hand in the production of the record. Perhaps those who manage A2ZCD did some work of this kind on home appliances, but this does not justify deceiving the general public. It could be that I\'m very far from the base and that the copyright on ""Passport to Pimlico"" ran out years ago. Perhaps no one owns the film and we all have the right to photocopy and sell it as the next. In that case, my apologies (protected) to the A2ZCD. I think, however, that buyers should be aware of the fact that they are not receiving merchandise that somehow reflects what most of us who collect films came to think of as ""remastered"" or even professionally produced. I have a Panasonic DVD recorder and I make my movie DVDs that I filmed on TMC. In my wildest dreams, however, it would never occur to me to sell them. Maybe this makes me an idiot. If so, at least I\'m honest.'",0
"b'Here is a riddle for all of you. What do you call ten gallons of ice cream and a tablespoon of manure? Ten liters of manure. I do not care how much they dress the DVD version of this movie, it will not change the fact that it\'s terrible. I\'m just giving this star, but keep five or six Advil at your fingertips. This should be enough to cover you for this. A couple of little bits of this disaster: 1. It\'s produced by Uwe Boll, the helm of two of the worst movies I\'ve ever seen in ""House of the Dead"" and ""Alone in the Dark"" 2. In what (to me) ) was a staggering moment of brutal honesty, Boll himself admitted that he had not filmed the movie until two weeks before shooting began. What he ended up with is a bunch of ""names"" who had a hole in their program and showed up for a quick salary and a free trip to Romania. It also shows that the whole film seems to have skipped the rehearsals completely and nobody seems to be interested in making an honest effort. Will Sanderson and Michael Madsen may have discovered the only way to survive a Boll movie. They had been completely drunk throughout the production. Ben Kingsley, who had previously had to deal with Madsen in the film ""Species"", even refused to be on the same set with him.5. In the harem scene with Meatloaf, those are HONEST TO GOD, 100% FULL-BLOODED ROMAN PROSTITUTE. I swear you can not invent this stuff. Apparently, Boll could not afford real actresses (their bonding rates made them too expensive), so he decided he could cut costs simply by ordering the real thing. This is a disaster from one side to the other. I\'ll give it though, it\'s better than his last two films. \'Bloodrayne\', at least, is a little unintentionally funny. Despite having said this, I could never recommend anyone to see him. It will only encourage man to continue. Only Boll, no doubt in my mind, is the most talented filmmaker I have ever seen. I am absolutely amazed that this guy continues to find his way behind a camera ...'",0
"b'""These are the continuous trips of the USS Enterprise"" in blue ray. Okay, we all know about Star Trek, so I\'m not going to examine the plot. I will say that the stories are very interesting, well thought out, well written and well played. I really like the way Star Trek touches ""Human Emotion"" and ""Human Element"". I want to talk about the blue ray transfer and it is exceptional. The image is crystal clear and sharp like a razor. I was honestly without words to watch it. I grew up with ST: TNG, and it was like I was watching it all over again. The colors are very clear and I could not believe what I was seeing. I am always amazed at how colorful and vibrant the images are. When I was reading other reviews, there were many complaints about the sound. UPDATE: It seems that the more you go on in the episodes, sometimes, the worse it becomes. It seems that one of the episodes has been recreated in a bathroom, a lot of echo and muffled. Even if it\'s not perfect, I\'m still happy to have it. *** UPDATE 10/6: If you have the initial set, you will have problems with the sound in some of the episodes. CBS / Paramount is having a disk exchange. Just send them an e-mail to: phe.stng @ bydeluxe.com. They will ask for the code on the back of the disk on the inside right side. It may be difficult to see, but it\'s there.

"b'This 1955 version is one of those smaller Akira Kurosawa films that is overlooked in favor of its larger films such as & quot; Rashomon & quot; and & quot; Seven Samurai & quot; but it is still worth seeing it. The great Toshiro Mifune is an industrialist in post-World War II Japan who is slowly going crazy with the idea that a nuclear war is coming and tries to convince his family (and his lovers) to flee to Japan with him. The obsessive portrait of Mifune is stuff of great tragedy, especially when in vain vainly to leave his greedy family and Takashi Shimura, the leader of the samurai in & quot; Seven Samurai & quot; , is also effective as a counselor who tries to help straighten out chaos. The film captures Japanese terror for the atomic bomb, a subject that Kurosawa would also have treated in his masterpiece, & quot; Ikiru & quot; , very well and with the greedy family that closes on a delirious patriarch, it comes to my mind & quot; King Lear & quot; , a story that the director will return to many years later in & quot; Ran "" . This is a small film by one of the great directors of the world, but very beautiful.'",1
"b'I had been impatient to see this film version of H.G. The Wells classic novel, as claimed by the producers, would remain true to the original location and period of the late Victorian era. Originally I had been discouraged from buying this film from the original release in 2005 due to the initial and significant amount of claims of low production values, poor FX, under par acting and ""endless walking scenes"". Suffice it to say that my passion for romance and courtesy got the better of me and I had to watch this movie for myself. Basically I was aware of the short films and I did not have high expectations on production so I can honestly say that I liked the film despite the too many flaws to list here and that have already been treated by reviewers much more eloquent than me. The assembly of scenes and events would confuse a spectator who has not read the original novel and who will soon lose the plot as the film moves from one scene to another of the narrator to Woking and his brother in London. at a certain moment his brother is presumably on a street in London, then suddenly attends the attack on the ladies of Elfinstone in a country lane and runs to their rescue. The Brazilian red grass appears immediately after the attack on Woking and Shepperton without any explanation within the film at all times has been said much of the meeting between HMS Thunderchild and the Martians while his brother escapes from England on a ""paddlesteamer"" , suffice it to say that it is really terrible and it would have been better to be left out altogether. There is a very announced scene in which the tripod legs come and go towards an artillery battery which is probably the best effect within this film and shows what could have been. Acting? There is a really terrible dialogue between the characters. I challenge anyone, for example, not to collapse when looking at the exchange between the ladies Elfinstone and her brother as they ""argue"" about how to escape from England. I will also award the James Doohan award for the worst Scottish accent seen at the cinema since Brigadoon conversed with a soldier on Horsell Common. On the contrary, when you look at the interaction with the actors trapped in the ruined house, even the meeting with the narrator of the dead woman on a street in ""London"", you are sadly reminded again of what could have been. I gave this 2-star movie which is generous and for the following reasons. The soundtrack is fantastic. It is refreshing that the film is faithful to the events of the book and has made the effort, even if bad, to set the book in Victorian England and not yet another updated version set in the United States. Unfortunately due to cost constraints, British-style buildings are digitized and set the Monty Python style inside a field in Washington state to represent Woking, Shepperton or London. I liked the design of the combat machines, even the managers in the pit scenes. my 17-year-old daughter who watched this film was not at all impressed but was intrigued by the film\'s point of view. As a result she made the effort to read the novel and to my surprise she read it from beginning to end. The irony is that H.G Wells has conquered another young admirer despite the bad quality of this film and for this I am really grateful. Would I still recommend this movie to a friend? Unfortunately, not if I wanted them to remain friends.'",0
"b""Anyone reading these reviews will have seen the television production and discovered it to the full; so I will limit my review to the quality of the DVD image - or rather to the lack of it. It is a pity that what was a beautiful and memorable TV movie has become a battered and faded shadow of his previous self. It is painful to see something that contains a special place in your heart to be treated so squalid. For years the only version that millions of people had seen on TV had a faded color and a low contrast that seemed to be practically shot in black and white! If this is what you're used to, the & quot; restored & quot; the version of this DVD (and the one shown on TV in the last 3 or 4 years) seems slightly better, but has just been restored. Just look at a canceled song in the extras section to see how beautiful and bright the original production is: clear, clear, pristine, with very saturated colors. Time and money SHOULD have been spent to bring the rest of the film to this level. It is morally wrong to put a defective product on the market, so have the courage to charge money for it. As many of our parents probably told us when we were young, & quot; Whatever is worth doing, it's worth doing it right! & quot;""",0
"b'COME IN ADVANCE MORNING Have you ever seen a movie and thought of yourself after ""that real man"", but not as a documentary but only a piece of cinema that seems to have been torn from real life. If you\'ve ever felt like this, chances are you\'re watching this here. `` Come Early Morning \'\' is a wonderful little film made wonderfully by Joey Lauren Adams of the fame of ""Chasing Amy"" and played by the great Ashley Judd and, of course, Jeffrey Donovan. It seems that the cameras have been installed throughout the city and this is what has been captured, it seems real. The film follows Lucy Fowler (Judd) on his journey through his thirtieth birthday, waking up every morning next to a useless guy after another. He also has to deal with a father who is desperately trying to spend time even if he seems to care less about it. So the story tells that she is a desperate and confused woman who seeks only love and acceptance. Obviously one could say that his problems with men come from his estranged relationship with his father. However, she ends up meeting at least one decent boy named Cal Percell {played excellently by Donovan} who seems to want a relationship with her despite her problem. It is this relationship that is the driving force of the film, even if the time spent with his father and roommate also adds interesting dynamics. The nice thing about all this is how it all ends. Writer / director Adams shows that all the time spent with Kevin Smith has been repaid because this is a wonderful debut film. His direction is excellent, but it\'s his way of writing that really makes this film so beautiful. As I said, this must be one of the most real films I\'ve seen in a while. I like the fact that it has not romanticized the protagonist and his problems, things do not end as you want. This film has an ending that is probably what really would happen, how big is it? Even those who have not grown up in a small town can refer to the things that happen in this film. Ashley Judd is naturally brilliant as the lost 30-year-old who is trying to find her way. And you know that Jeffery Donovan is excellent as the guy who should have been the one for her. Laura Prepon\'s fame of ""That\'s 70\'s Show"" is as good as her roommate and Judd\'s best friend, she even finds love. Scott Wilson is also brilliant as the father of his religion that he finds out of himself. Actually the whole cast is exceptional and deserves all the merit of the world. Apart from this, the film was shot very well and for such a limited budget it seems that the film has shown the whole city even if it is not. I must say that this is one of the best films that came out in a while and a wonderful debut for a director. To those who seem so I say that spread the word and see it now. And for those who have yet to see it I recommend it as a purchase but I imagine you can try a rent.

"b'This is a typical extravagant comedy from the 60s! Some might like it, and some do not. But if you are a Mini Cooper fan or just a car enthusiast (the opening scene, with a Lamborghini Miura driving through the Italian Alps is fantastic!), You must watch this movie! The Mini Coopers are the real stars of this film! The aforementioned Lamborghini Miura, a DB-4 Aston Martin, a Daimler, a pair of Jaguar E-type, and a group of Italian cars of the late sixties like Alfa Romeos and FIAT are the support stars! This is undoubtedly the film of a car enthusiast! A must for lovers of Mini Cooper!'",1

But the Blu-Ray is worth the money: a simply superb edition of one of the greatest action / adventure films ever made.""",1
"b'as a fan of Lennon, I was extremely reluctant to see this film at first. However, after a few jokes from my Beatles friends who had seen the film, I decided to rent it and was amazed at how brilliant the film was. Everything from casting to directing was top notch. I really enjoyed the jonas ball and the multitude of impressive supporting actors who lent their sharp talent to the screen. For me personally, apart from Jonas, who is fantastic, I found that the psychologist and the taxi driver were also extremely talented. All in all I found the killing of John Lennon as an extroardinary film and I highly recommend it.'",1
"b""Everything was covered by other reviewers, but I wanted to ask if CBS wanted to add the option to run EVERY episode with the bumpers intact. At this time, only a few include the option to have `` Bonanza return after these messages '', and `` And now ... the exciting conclusion of Bonanza ''. It would be great to be able to have those included in each episode. That's all I have to say, except that please bring the season more often.""",1
"b""Just right pathetic. It is safe to say that it is so and I will classify it as the worst film by Stephen Dorff (Cecil B. Demented, Blade, Entropy) and Christian Slater (Pump Up The Volume, True Romance, Heathers). Slater is a paranormal expert who 22 years ago was part of a laboratory experiment in which children were tested in an orphanage. Slater hunts for artifacts from a lost civilization ... once he was part of a high-level government group that tracks a type of creature that preaches in the dark and hates light, and no I'm not talking about vampires .... Put it clearly as the children of Godzilla look like. Slater teams up with former archaeologist Tara Reid (Van Wilder, Urban Legend, Cruel Intentions) and his old friend with whom he worked in the elite government group ... played by Dorff. Everybody threw out the film that suffered from a big headache while watching a misunderstood film, shot in an unfair way, with twists and turns in which we know who died and lives. Directed by House Of The Dead director Uwe Boll and I can tell you that this film is Bolls ** t. It can not be a direct disgust. What a waste of actors and what a waste of my time. Divert this toxic waste. Because, well, if you want to try suffering with action scenes with heavy metal soundtracks and a banal love scene with Reid and Slater with the happiest music ... this is your ticket.""",0

"b'The Banks family needs a new nanny for Jane and Michael. Fortunately, it gets to the wind in the form of Mary Poppins. It\'s everything kids want, fun and magical. But while he is taking them to a country where they paint gypsum paintings and tea rooms on the ceiling, their father is less happy. Can it be done to see beyond the end of his nose? Ok, this movie is really a bit more of an excuse for the numbers of songs and dances. It is still fantastic! The plot is very thin, and you lose the site in the middle of some of their fantastic scenes. Naturally, part of this is due to the fact that the film is based on a book that in reality is nothing but stories. Still this movie is more fun than anything else. And he has it in his hand. Which child would not it be fun to imagine doing all the things Jane and Michael do in this movie? It is said that Walt Disney has poured out everything he had learned in making this film, and this shows. Many of the special effects hold up very well today. There were some that I had not yet figured out until I saw this special edition. And the music! Any Disney fan knows these songs by heart. And you can not help but find yourself humming ""A spoonful of sugar"", ""Jolly Holiday"", ""Let\'s go flying a kite"" or ""Chim Chim Cher-ee"" for days after seeing it. Those who want to own a great DVD of this film will not be disappointed by this set of two discs. Disc one presents the film in all its glory on the screen. I can not see how it has ever been better. The soundtrack has many different options, but the Home Theater mix will leave you speechless. Is fantastic . There is also a track of comments with Julie Andrews, Dick van Dyke, Karen Dubice (Jane) and Richard Sherman. Scattered in are archival comments from others, including Disney itself. Also included are some pop-up facts to read together while watching the film. Disc Two presents a new documentary on the film, a canceled song and more on music with Julie, Dick and the composers. And be sure to take a look at the animated ""The cat that looked at a king"", a story adapted from one of the following books in the series. One thing that clearly and clearly emerges in this set is how much fun everyone has had by making it and how much they respect Walt Disney. The fact that this film lasted 40 years is the testimony of his genius. With this set, it will be appreciated by future generations.'",1
"b""I would not go up to the previous review saying it's sort of a liberal conspiracy movie (and if it is, I would hate to hear what people say about movies like Ferngully and Once Upon A Forest). I doubt that the fact that most humans worry little about our impact on the environment is new to anyone, not even the fact that some of us kill other living creatures for a miracle of reasons ranging from entertainment to real need. Having said that, however, I can not give this film a better rating. CG animation has a quality * far less than the cover (more in line with a Saturday morning cartoon than an actual feature film). I do not think I found a joke funny in the whole movie, and more than a few scenes were so coarse that I preferred to look away rather than look at them. The images are often dark and destabilizing (the woman trying to decapitate a cat with a chainsaw comes to mind), and the peaceful outdoor scenes look very fake. The animation has several parts that are notoriously poor compared to a good CG movie (or even decent). Furthermore, humans are distorted almost beyond recognition. In short, there are many good CG titles, but this is certainly not one of these.""",0

"b'Gregory Peck beautifully plays the role of squadron commander of a precision bombing squadron during World War II. Playing & quot; General Savage & quot; The role of Peck is that of an incoming commander with rigid beliefs of military discipline to get the most out of his men and bring out in them what was missing from their previous commander. The script itself is fun with filosfus and suspense without a break. I would recommend this film very strongly as a training video for people doing professions where leadership is the key to success. Look closely at how General Savage incorporates strict discipline with moderation in his interactions with his men. With the gain of respect, he also gained the trust of the troops. This form of leadership is almost non-existent today. However, it is literally, & quot; combat tried & quot; .'",1

"b'This film begins with a simple question from Richard Lobb of the National Chicken Council: ""In a sense, we do not produce chickens, we produce food, which involves producing a lot of food in a small amount of space at a very affordable price. someone explain to me what\'s wrong with this. ""Well, this film explains very well what\'s wrong with that. The first point is that it is not good to treat animals as if they were simple * objects *. You will see chickens and meat kneeling in their excrement. You will also see chickens in their cages, not being able to carry even their own weight. The animals are kept all the time in the dark, included for us. It was very difficult for filmmakers to get shots from those chicken houses. The second point, connected in one way to the previous one, is that our food can easily be contaminated by E-coli, due to the animal dejections carried on their skin. Here\'s how you can poison food in the slaughterhouse. Barbara Kowalcyk, the mother of a 2.5-year-old child, has experienced the most horrible experience of anyone who can suffer: the death of her son ... The reason: eating a .. burgers ... ""We trust our government to be protected, but we are not protected at the most basic level,"" he says. This is not an inconvenient truth - although this film was produced by the same company that brought us the documentary with the same title. This is an ugly truth. Can we do something about it? Absolutely ""You can change the world at every bite"". Switch to organic products. It would be even better to connect again with the source of your food, what you are eating, what you are putting in your mouth! The best thing to do would be to involve a local farmer that you know and can trust.'",1
"b'The release of Spellbound Criterion by Alfred Hitchcock has a slight flaw. 74 minutes in the film we get a shot of J.B.

We then cut to Brulov for his next line \'Oh, I thought it was you.\' Simple, Well, the Criterion DVD cuts off the razor blade too early, and then the Brulov footage that bites his second line, while overwriting his! st!

I understand that this is not happening with every set of DVDs, but many sets (including both my own) have DVDs that jump and stop. I have to skip entire chapters of the shows just to get to the next episode. The problem is to use both sides of the DVD to store the episodes. If any research had been done on two-sided DVDs before putting this wonderful show on the cheaper two-sided format, then we would not have had so many DVD sets to skip. I really wish they had gone for the best quality route and not for the cheapest route.""",0
"b""Marcel Carne's paradise children succeeds on so many levels that he rightly deserves to be called one of the greatest films of all time. Carne filmed the film in a piecemeal way during the Nazi occupation of Paris. His film was officially supported despite the occupation, as the Nazis wanted to show that they were friendly with the arts. This created the ironic situation in which Carne was taking money from the government to support a film by day and help channel the French resistance overnight. One actor was presumably a Nazi collaborator. It mysteriously disappeared during filming and had to be replaced. Despite all these obstacles, Carne managed to beautifully recreate 19th-century Paris. In this way, the film itself is a triumph of the creative spirit. The title refers to the poor, who could only afford such high places in the theater that they were almost between the beams ... yet, these were the real audience the actors performed for. The story is a series of lives that intersect and all rotate in one way or another around the tired and bohemian Garance (played by Arletty in Mona Lisa). In addition to this, the film revolves around the theatrical life of 1840 in Paris: the actors, the audience and everyone in between. Garance is almost a courtesan: she moves comfortably among four men who love her, apparently not touched by any of them ... in the end she falls in love with the mime Baptiste (Jean-Louis Barrault) .... but Baptiste is married with a ' another woman after losing her chance with Garance years before. Will they get together? In the end, we spectators are so much the Children of the Gods, or Children of Paradise, that the title refers to the theater audience in the film. In fact, both opening and closing titles are played against a theater tent. We are the spectators in the Gods and the actors perform for us living their lives: to love, to live, to die ... to experience both pain and joy. The film of Carne lasts over three hours, but it is never late. The stories intersect and can not be adequately described in a simple review like this ... Four men love Garance, and in a sense all their lives intersect in and around the theater. Cinematography is surprising. There is a crowd scene at the end of the film that resists anything that has ever been filmed: it is simply magnificent. Baptiste is lost (in many ways) in a mass of humanity in movement. This scene alone is reason enough to see the movie. I suspect this is a movie that people love or hate. The long duration can put many people back, but this is a pity. The film is not for those who want instant gratification. Instead, it is something to taste and to taste. If all this makes it too serious, be sure it is not. Children of Paradise is a tragedy in some ways, but it is also a play in the Shakespearean sense. This was a film made for a company like Criterion, and they do it justice in their DVD edition. The two halves of the film are presented on individual discs, so the film never suffers from compression defects or other problems. The restoration is impeccable: you will never know that this film is almost sixty years old. The audio is mono but very clean, without hiss or static. The criterion also includes some supplements, reviews, filmographies, trailers, etc., but the real pleasure is the film itself. It is timeless.""",1
"b'I want to start by saying that this is the best Blu Ray version I\'ve purchased to date. The packaging is wonderful with its ""keepsake"" appearance, and the additional additional features alone are worth the small price. Seeing Linda Blair\'s real movie (not just about complete makeup) on the set is priceless and definitely surpasses any extras of previous versions. For important things ... .The movie. I must say that this has become my favorite movie of all time. I\'m not a fan of horror at all. I have some favors of the kind ... but I opt for more for the comedian and / or the fantastic. I like or be relieved of laughter, or completely removed from reality. You ask me ""So why on Earth would you consider The Exorcist your favorite movie?"" ""Simple, it\'s a modern parabola and it\'s one of those rare movies that really produces its desired effect in every frame."" The Exorcist ""movie horror is a bit \'shortsighted.It\'s a spiritual drama, a psychological thriller and a supernatural tale ... all thrown into one, 37 years later, it is still valid and today is as relevant as it was then.The difference here is that now we live in a society that is, as Blatty says in the documentary Fear Of God ""completely exhausted and depraved."" Nothing here seems to shock and the fourteen now see this film as ""ridiculous."" It\'s a shame, because here there\'s a lot of more than pea soup and rotating heads, it is all about the terror of the unknown ... the fear and trepidation involved in all metaphysical and spiritual things: it concerns the mystery of faith and its ability to triumph in the end. Pictures, the sounds and the story ... everything mixes here. It is incredibly well written by Blatty. The sense of documentary realism of Friedkin serves the plot well. The acting is top notch for a cast that could not have been more perfect. Dick Smith\'s trick is revolutionary, not just with Linda Blair, but with Max Von Sydow who was in the mid-forties at the time. Also worthy of note is the use of Owen Roizman of different light textures and, of course, his masterful and iconic stroke of Merrin\'s arrival. I was lucky to see the screening of Fathom on September 30th and while watching this film a big screen with digital audio was fantastic, I still have to say that it sounds better and provides more unnerving sensations when you look at home ... in the dark . This is the really terrifying corner of this film ... it reminds us that no matter how we think we are safe (even at home with all the lights on), there is nothing that the real evil will not do and nowhere does not go to manifest.'",1
"b'Let me start by saying that I love "" Oh My Goddess & quot; and I could not wait for the series DVD to come out. It\'s very sweet, fun and easily one of the most fascinating series I\'ve ever seen. I am very happy to spend some time with Belldandy, Keichi, Skuld and Urd. That said, I am shocked and disappointed to find that they split the series on two DVDs, each for a separate sale. The episodes are very short, for a total of just over an hour for DVD (I think they are 82 minutes for Vol. 1 and 62 minutes for Vol. 2). There are no extra features included. Yikes!

"b'Mature is not a sex film Lolita as exploitative as might suggest the over-saturated key art. Instead, it is a blatant, unusual exploration of female sexuality and its age, imaginarily direct and well interpreted by its three protagonists. The screenplay sometimes becomes rocky and crude as in many indie films (too much curse is a curse in the indie scripts), but the film is visually stunning, and the pile of small moments is delightful - when Violet discovers adult magazines, for example , or when the gruff man carrying the nuns has to explain his menstruation. And the final scene with the two sisters is devastating, a strange amalgam of suspense, family drama and psychosexual nuances. A wonderful soundtrack by Anton Sanko (formerly Suzanne Vega Band) enriches this aesthetically excellent film, curiously moving, ultimately very obscure.'",1
"b""The Iron Giant is a loose adaptation of a wonderful book with the same title, by Ted Hughes (written in the late sixties). In the book the origins of the giant are unknown, and initially it is buried under the ground before being attacked and eventually made friends. The enemy in the book, which becomes a common enemy of both humans and giants and the cause of their alliance, was a giant dragon-like creature (as big as Australia!) That the giant ends up being smarter. In the film, set during the Cold War, and presenting a beautiful portrait of the atmosphere of the '50s, the enemy is American - and our tendency to fear what is alien, to shoot first and ask questions later. I think this is, in the end, more profound. Of course, the original author may have had some of these allegories in mind when he wrote the original book, since the dragon from space ends up destroying and wrapping much of the planet in darkness, almost like a world war. But if so, would their alliance with the giant mean an alliance with military technology to prevent a world war? In the film, the robot is just a cute robot from space, which humans can choose to make a friend or establish as an enemy. In any case, this is easily one of the best animated films released by the United States in the last decade (and one of the others is by the same director, Brad Bird).""",1
"b""I can not remember the last time I was so entertained by a film that I watched it three times in 24 hours. STILL CRAZY took me from my sad and mediocre existence from the middle age and brought me back to my university years in the seventies, when I was in a part-time ragtag band. Do not make mistakes on this: this film nails the chaotic, bizarre, self-absorbed, overbearing and irresistibly dysfunctional behavior of rock musicians. The characters' antics - even in middle age as they try to revive their careers - have brought back a plethora of memories. I too can remember the concerts that went wrong; band members who shout each other's chords during a song; the frequent & quot; artistic & quot; disagreements; improvised jam sessions in barns, garages, empty rooms for high school bands; and the thrill of connecting with an audience (usually a drunken audience). Buy this movie ... rent this movie ... watch this movie. It is more than just a comedy; there is a very real human component that also transcends the tumultuous world of the music industry. You will burst, you will wipe away an occasional tear, and you will be completely amused. The flame still burns. God bless rock 'n roll!""",1

This film ended up as a horror movie. It's a terrible example for all the black women they could watch. That kind of aggressive and sadistic behavior is what you could read in the news, not in a romantic comedy or drama or whatever this melodrama should have been. I hope that black women do not watch this movie and think that the end of this film is ok, because it's rather sinister. Black men also seem unusually weak while black women seem dominant. No man really wants a woman with a strong, dominant mouth, regardless of what Tyler Perry says. This movie gave me nightmares.""",0
"b""I own a VHS copy of ALICE IN ACIDLAND, bought by Something Weird years ago. I'm a big fan of the exploitation / drug trip films of the '60s and ALICE IN ACIDLAND has always been one of my favorites. Finally I switched to DVD and I was disappointed.

And towards the end of the film, an entire scene was eliminated. The cut images are all filming containing complete frontal nudity and / or more brutal violence. The cuts are obvious: no attempt was made to make them flow with the film ... the music and the narrated voice clumsily cut with each instance of trimming footage. The information on the execution time on the box are also wrong ... on box, the original execution time of ALICE is listed: 62 minutes. But the DVD version only works for 53 minutes with all the clippings. I've been a fan of Something Weird for years ... But now I'm disappointed with the company.

"b'In short: style on substance. There are some excellent sequences, but that\'s all what seems to be a movie, well-planned sequences and performed - but with nothing coherent that unites the whole thing together. The ""airplane near the stop and the last-minute rescue"" is extremely impressive and the machine-gun ammunition slamming on Supe\'s chest, followed by the bullet in her eyes, is magnificent. My jaw was falling and I almost wanted to cheer. Here\'s what Superman talks about: seeing him defeating the bad guys in new, engaging, even fun ways. But that was where the fun ended. Like what Superman does not speak about are the children of love and the ridiculous heroic blast with kryptonite. I find that both are so horribly far-fetched that they both need to be ridiculed. As Brodie (cleverly played by Jason Lee in Kevin Smith\'s Mallrats) points out, ""It\'s impossible, Lois Lane could never have Superman\'s baby, do you think his fallopian tubes can handle his sperm? during sex, he probably blows a load like a shotgun shot ... right behind his back. \'\' So, apart from the fact that Lois Lane is alive in post coitus, you would then have the impossibility for a human being to conceive and complete a child of an alien Do not forget that just because Clark Kent appears and behaves like a human being, he is an alien, he is a completely different species, and completely different species can not mate. think of the massacre that would cause in the animal kingdom if a lion falls in love and mates with a crocodile or a guinea fowl The other problem that makes me shiver with rage is the whole idiot concept of Superman that is physically able to lift an entire continent of kryptonite into space. As Internet blogger dpogue21 so prophetically expresses it (much better than I could - so thanks dpogue) in his review of imdb, ""My next complaint is that Superman raises a continent made of kryptonite in space. of the Simpsons to point out what\'s wrong with this.I do not know how many comic books he has read Bryan Singer, but when Superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite, he just has the strength to stay upright. \'idea to fly him a big island made from his greatest weakness in space, no longer has any commercial relationship with other projects related to Superman.The concept is as ridiculous as making a Dracula film in which the protagonist has a stake in the heart and still manages to pilot a spaceship made of garlic in the sun Why not just have Superman eaten kryptonite? Can you eat it and then brush your teeth with it, and then an give to sleep in kryptonite pajamas. It is no longer absurd that he has hoisted a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall helplessly through the atmosphere without burning back or splashing across the central park when it hits the ground. \'\' Do I have to say more? I do not think so. ** [...]'",0
"b'I was surprised by the fact that the editorial reviews of this film treat him like another film, which certainly is NOT. I would describe it in various ways: like the film that John Waters would give to his left hand; like a terrifying NEAR-sendup of intense dance dramas, teargas like Red Shoes, which takes off the hat to the concept of ""field"" without throwing away the whole experience just to stay consistent with the attitude; like a comedy that, if you get the joke, will sometimes make you giggle. There are times when I was not sure which movie I was on, like the plot listed on Flashdance and then Cinderella. But this is the kind of film it is; it embraces the operatic emotion and the high melodrama, and while recognizing the ordinary, it never becomes. And it communicates magnificently the essential absurdity of all the integral and inclusive subcultures. (The constant exhortations of the hero to the hero not to abandon themselves to ""pleasing moves to the crowd"" are hilarious and at the same time totally typical of such subcultures, where the most sensible question is always ""Who on earth has made these rules ?! ``) It\'s a weird and intense film that keeps you constantly balanced, and you wonder if you take it seriously or as a kind of elaborate comic dream (think of Rocky Horror photo exhibition) .The nice thing is that you never have to decide You can enjoy new aspects on multiple views.'",1
"b""Ridley Scott's Alien must be considered one of the best thrillers ever set on celluloid. It is located there with films such as Psycho by Hitchcock and Dracula by Tod Browning (1931). Alien is pretty much a classic haunted house movie, but instead of an old and spectral legacy from the Victorian era we have an old, shabby, massive merchant-space and the infinite darkness of the space itself. Alien rises above her B credentials -movie - - this film is really a B-movie in the heart - with a very tense and intelligent script, and an exceptional direction by Ridley Scott. From the long opening sequence of the Nostromo that fills the screen, the audience knows that it will be treated with an exceptionally filmed film. Ridley Scott has always been known for his artistic direction and the biomechanical aspect of the sets in Alien helps to increase the sense of terror and horror. Help Scott and his crew decide to hire the famous Swiss surrealist H.R. Giger to design the appearance of sets and creatures. Anyone who has seen Giger's work can easily see his influence in Alien's stage design. The final design of Giger for the main creature itself will go down as one of the best creations in the history of cinema. By now, everyone knows what to imagine in their heads when someone mentions the words Alien and movies together. The group of actors chosen for the film is excellent from top to bottom. Capt by Tom Skerritt. Dallas is a solid foundation on which the rest of the characters revolve. The slow descent into the hysteria of the character of Veronica Cartwright - - absolutely appropriate to the situation that she and the rest of her teammates are facing - - is like a barometer for the growing terror that permeates the whole film from the beginning to the end . The cast detachment must be Sigourney Weaver. The fact that this was his first major film is a good omen for what the audience could expect from her when her career exploded. His character as Lieutenant Ellen Ripley is virtually the antithesis of the Cartwright Lambert. Where Lambert slowly descended into a paralyzing hysteria, Ripley slowly took control of the situation and became the de facto leader after Dallas. The general tone of the film owes much to the past of horror / thriller movies. But instead of constant bravado and false measures, Scott slowly accumulated tensions and terror with long slow strokes of empty corridors and cargo holds. For a film that is considered one of the best horror films ever made, Alien does not have many dark areas where the monster suddenly jumps. The monster will jump out of well lit and spacious areas. Scott has also used Spielberg's ploy to prevent the monstrous creature from being on the screen for no more than quick glimpses. It is not until the end we see the alien creature of Giger in all its glory. The latter of the many editions of Alien DVD has finally arrived with modified scenes that add even more shock and horror to the film. I have to agree with Scott's reasoning for removing the scenes personally. Slow down the roller coaster, beat beat per hour in the last part of the film. But in the comfort of your home theater, these reworked scenes are easier to understand. The appearance of both the original theatrical part and the director's cut has been remastered and looks fantastic, especially when viewed on a progressive scan DVD player and a dedicated widescreen HDTV. Sound and music have also received a 4-star remastering treatment to make the most of home theater systems that are growing in number.

I grew up with Schoolhouse Rock, but to be honest I only thought about it when my husband and I laughed nostalgically about memorable songs like Conjunction Junction. Then, he bought the 30th anniversary edition for our daughter (she was trying to qualify for free shipping when she was buying BelleVille Tripletts!). So, we can say that none of us has foreseen how fantastic this DVD would be - AGAIN! My 3 year old boy adores it, and I can not say enough big things about the creative texts that teach grammar, numbers and how the body works (maybe I should get into my bag of adjectives, which my daughter affectionately calls ""magic"" \'). It is the only DVD we have that I have no apprehension about evil or scary characters, obscure plots or questionable influences (which are surprising in many videos for preschoolers). If you are asking yourself to get this video, do not be surprised anymore. It\'s a timeless winner that will not disappoint (unless you\'re looking for obscure plots and questionable influences!)'",1

"b'The latest robbery by a professional thief and his team is terribly wrong, and the organizer of the impeccable floors gets more than he has contracted for. Agents and mobsters chase him, but he gets cold under pressure, frustrates the other side\'s plans and always manages to extricate himself from the mud. This is a standard format for action films. It seems clich\xc3\xa9 eacute; d is predictable, but it works well with a good pace in action and a sure guide of the director. But ""7 seconds"" does not have them. Wesley Snipes plays the thief named Jack. Jack\'s bankrupt robbery in Bucharest, Romania, puts him in trouble again because his girlfriend / crime partner is kidnapped during shootings. He takes hostage a NATO military policeman (Tamzin Outhwaite who shows off his British accent) after the chaos (and also sparing his life), and engages in a pursuit in urban cars with familiar settings. The story does not make much sense (why steal casino money in Romania?), But the first part of ""7 seconds"" is fun with decent stunts and a bit of humor. The actions are confusing and you do not know where these cars run wildly, but at least the acrobatics are not bad. Then in the central part of the film insists the boredom, which stops the actions and begins to introduce superfluous characters, in addition to a plot plot or two. We do not need to see the Wesley Snipes walking in the station and put a brief case in the coin cabinet there. Or we do not really care what the folder really contains; and we do not even want to know if something in it (whatever it is) is real or not. We want thrills and action, or funny dialogues. With the exception of some short martial arts acrobatics and moderately entertaining jokes between Snipes and Outhwaite, ""7 Seconds"" does not have much to show, particularly in its second part, in which the film has another sequence of automotive acrobatics involving street cars, but It is marked by a fickle editing. We often hear complaints or criticism about films directed to the video, but in reality some of them are quite good, offering 90-minute entertainment like the films of Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren. Unfortunately, for all the good acting of the stars, ""7 seconds"" by Wesley Snipes is not one of them.'",0

"b'The Crucible, based on Arthur Miller\'s drama, is a fun, if not always accurate, version of the events in the Salem village of 1692. After reading several books on the subject, I can not yet say with certainty what has led to the events that so many men and women were accused of witchcraft and so many young girls seemed afflicted. One may wonder why it was only the females of Salem, and not the males who seemed to be afflicted with screams, catatonic states, hallucinations, etc. ... In any case, one conclusion I could not draw was that of a despised woman, in this case Abigail Williams played by Winona Ryder whose advances are rejected by the married John Proctor (Daniel Day Lewis). The Proctors are also much younger in the film than they were in real life. John was sixty when he was hanged. Elizabeth would have been in her mid-40s at the time of rehearsals. Pregnancy saved her from the hangman\'s noose. The film maintains a good deal of accuracy in the treatment of the Tituba slave and his part in the whole affair, as well as accusations against some of the ""villains"" of cities like Goody Nurse and Giles Corey who was pressed to death for refusing to testify . The courtroom scenes were the most dynamic and exciting, and they recalled those vintage paintings of old books that described evidence with severe Puritan judges who pointed accusing fingers. The film also did a good job of capturing that seventeenth-century repressive setting and the costume was of the highest quality. The best interpretations for me came from those men who portrayed the various ministers and judges, in particular Bruce Davison as Reverend Parris and Paul Scofield as Judge Danforth. While not a completely accurate film, it still does a good job capturing one of the seminal events in American history. Detected by Tim Janson'",1

"b'This film starts quickly and quickly immerses the viewer in a very strange world with dialogues and actions that flare up and make it difficult to keep up. The important thing is to stay there and all the pieces will start to fit together. The film is based on a novel by Philip K. Dick, known for his very original imagination and who invented ideas for stories different from anyone else. This is another of those original narrative lines and takes the viewer on a wild ride. Fortunately, the pieces start to be all together and they do it with a dramatic use of the surround speakers and a lot of action on the screen. The basic premise of the film is a developed technology that allows the display of a crime before it actually happens, so the police can intervene and stop the crime before it takes place. Just as this crime prevention system is ready to go nationwide something happens that changes everything. The character of Tom Cruise, a policeman named John Anderton, is suddenly immersed in a situation that threatens his own life. Now he must use the crime prevention system called Precrime to find out the truth and find out who is outside to frame him. His quest for truth provides the foundation for this thrilling action film. I encourage the viewer to give the film an opportunity because, although at first it may seem confusing, it quickly turns into a good science fiction adventure film.'",1
"b'Some people in Germany have accused this film of trying to ""harm"" the Third Reich crimes. This could not be further from the truth, and I will explain why Bruno Ganz plays Hitler the man. Hitler is the man who loves his dog, who is kind to his secretary, who loves his friends and spits on the people he thinks he is about to betray, who tells those he cares to save even while preparing to take cyanide, to shoot and then be burned. This is a boy who, as long as you do not talk about the Jews or world domination, it would not be so difficult to live with him. However, this is still Hitler the monster. Being a vegetarian does not absolve him from being directly responsible for the death of millions or throwing the whole world into war. Hitler the two-dimensional monster is inseparable from Hitler the three-dimensional man, and it is this that reminds us every time that makes you feel sorry for him even if you know, and the film reminds you, that he was a monster. All the monsters of history - past, present and future - were and are and will be human beings. We like to imagine Hitler as a sort of inhuman monster, but he was only human. Too human. This is why this film makes people uncomfortable; reminds them that any ""man who looks like a nice fellow"" of men could turn out to be a monster if the right questions are never asked or ideas are never questioned. The warning is inconvenient: no ideologue can be trusted on face value. Not just one, ever. And / that is the true importance of this film, if ""Never again"" is having any kind of real meaning next to a slogan. If I were a history teacher, I would show this film followed by / Schindler\'s List /. Both are equally true and equally important sides of history: all this horror comes from simple human beings.'",1

"b'I\'ve been and still am a loyal fan of Xena and Gabrielle. Let me remind those who liked the end of something. Real life is full of sadness, misery, loss and tragedy. We watch TV and movies to escape reality. Xena was a tragic figure at the beginning of her life. He killed for little or no reason. But she saw that he was wrong. He changed his ways and fought for justice. There is no way to bring the killed back to life. But Xena repented and dedicated her life to fighting forever. He risked his life many times to save the lives of countless others. (Let those without sin cast the first stone) We need a heroine like Xena. We want to see that those in the ""white hats"" win and that the bad guys in the ""black hats"" lose. I know that reality does not work this way many times. But Xena was different. She\'s special I think it\'s more digestive, very tragic and pathetic that Xena has had to die. And if dying was not enough, beheading made my stomach turn. I own the whole series. But I will never watch the last episode again. I gave this two stars because the tragic and useless death of Xena puts a flaw in the whole series.'",0

"b'I rented it because I like westerns and because Michael Madsen is an actor I like. Forget about it . In the first twenty minutes the interest was completely lost: the acting was actually well below the average for a high school production, and Madsen barely.

(See the review here on Amazon for ""All Hell Broke Loose"" ""Starring the late David Carradine."" I did not write it, but also summarizes this film.) The cover of this dog has a \'review\' something like `` 3:10 to Yuma riding against True Grit. \'\' If there is a `` with \'\' in making you buy or rent a movie, this package is.

"b""Among the many interpretations of this comedy that I saw on stage and on screen, this is the best - a strong statement considering the many excellent actors who were attracted to the powerful characters of Tennessee Williams (eg Katherine Hepburn and Sam Waterston). It seems that John Malkovich was born to play Tom, the artist divided between family duties and the desire to travel. The intense and percussive style of Malkovich is an ideal combination for the drama of Williams, in which the text and his poetry dominate. His interpretation in this role is the most convincing of all I've seen, and he avoids the trap of allowing Tom to become too dark and self-absorbed. Even Joanne Woodward is as perfect as Amanda, who, though deluded, narrow and even stupid, holds her family together through her unique blend of courage and despair. Karen Allen and James Naughton also capture what I think Williams must have understood in the characters Laura Wingfield and in the gentlemen caller, and the two generate true chemistry in the main scene with the glass unicorn. This is a must for anyone interested in American theater.""",1
"b""The wooden box is a bit cumbersome, but that's what matters inside, and what's inside this wooden box is a must for any Morse enthusiast. This must be one of the best television dramas that the British, or anyone else, have come up with. Colin Dexter's stories are well written and the characters adapt well to the screen thanks to the excellent acting of the late John Thaw. Morse is a character sometimes sad, but always admirable. Kevin Whately, like Lewis, often painfully naive, is the perfect support of intelligence and love for Morse's culture. The individual plots offer the usual part of twists, turns and false tricks to make you guess, but the stories are not pretentious in their complexity. If you like solid police drama with a good dose of English culture, then this series is perfect for you.""",1
"b'For a long time a fan of Irish music, I turned to a series of artists to satiate my appetite. Bing Crosby and John McCormick were succeeded by the Irish Tenors.

Among the melodies there are traditional Irish songs such as ""Macushla"" and ""Croppy Boy"", along with more recent pieces, such as ""The Green Fields of France"" and ""How are the things in Glocca Morra""?

"b'I vaguely remember the game to which this film was titled and was a fan of some of the old Christian Slater films, so even after learning that it was a horrible film, I decided to rent it. I have a strange fondness for bad scifi movies because it\'s fun to see how ridiculous the writing is and how bad the special effects are, not to mention all the nameless actors who are trying to pretend they can act. Unfortunately this film was not fun in any way, shape or form. Christian Slater is a good actor and the film seemed to have a decent budget for the creatures, which were animated quite well, but apart from these two points this film did not even qualify for a `` direct to Sci-fi \'\' channel publication. There was no fun at all in this movie. The story made no sense, the supporting actors were very rigid and none of the characters seemed to care about any of the other characters. At one point in the film Christian Slater mentions ""I just killed my long friend"" the same way you said ""I just poured my coffee on a pair of stained pants that I was about to throw away"". . I guess it could sum up the whole movie. The actors did not seem to care, the director did not seem to care, the editors did not seem to care, in fact the only propio that seemed to really do a decent job were the animators who animated the monsters. After seeing this ""film"", I felt very sad for Christian Slater. His career must be completely over now. I am depressed . It\'s time to look at Madagascar and cheer me up.'",0

This is a film that I would normally give a 4 or even a five-star, but WB pumped this thing without even bothering to check the sound mix, or maybe they modified it in some way incomprehensible to me. For whatever reason, it is almost preferable to buy the VHS because you will have the complete soundtrack and it probably looks just as good. And we do not even talk about the terrible cover they have stuck on the film. All in all, WB should be ashamed of their overflowing apathy - especially because we'll probably never see another edition of this film without importing it (it should be released in another country).""",0

"b""It seems that good films inspire remakes. As for if they are & quot; inspired & quot; the remakes are always open to the question. Both versions of The Italian Job have unique features that make them interesting, but for pure acting and fun (with the exception of Ed Norton in the remake that seems to be trapped in a film he does not like), 1969 's Italian work is the my personal choice of the two. Mark Wahlberg can not hold a candle (and he is not an actor frankly) for Michael Caine in the original film. There are almost so many things that make this classic movie beat as there are seconds on a watch. The plot focuses more on the escape than the caper. This unique touch has transformed the formulate into the head. The formidable cast (including the late Noel Coward in his last screen appearance and, of all, Benny Hill!) Presents the wonderful Michael Caine in the lead. It gives a great interpretation and helps the ensemble to live up to it. The late Peter Collinson directs with energy and wit that give life to what could have been, despite the twists and turns, a routine film. Collinson is a cult director who died relatively young before he could keep his full directorial promise. I also recommend his cult psychological thriller Straight On Till Morning, which became available on DVD last year. Although it is hampered by some visual changes and conventions of the mid-'70s, Morning is more than its own with the explosions films of the time. The film is a commentary piece that presents both the original producer of the film and a number of beautiful extras. It's nice to have this minor classic finally restored to the right aspect ratio. The DVD transfer is pretty good and while the print quality varies slightly, it's really good overall.""",1

Although he left and Lois moved on to another man, love is definitely still there. Then, of course, there\'s the ongoing battle between Lex Luthor and Superman, so it\'s like having two great stories in a movie! There is an emotional chemistry in this film that is undeniable. You can actually hear what the superman is going through throughout the movie, both good and bad. I have seen this movie 5 times since its release ... I give director / writer Bryan Singer a big thumb up for a compelling, emotional and well-written story.'",1
"b'Director Jon Reiss and producer Tracy Wares take us on a world tour of graffiti in ""Bomb It"". The film is more favorable to the art of graffiti than to the detriment of this, but interviews individuals who make their mission the liberation of graffiti and graffiti on 4 continents. There is an underground current that calls into question who should decide what we look at in public spaces, a provocative question but not really the film\'s goal. `` Bomb It \'\' covers a lot of ground in the history and scope of graffiti art, but with good results, since we can see that graffiti artists are not all the same. Graffiti has evolved over time and its purpose is different in different cultures and subcultures. ""Bomb It"" begins by interviewing Cornbread, a Philadelphian whose campaign to tag everything with his moniker in 1967 could make him the first modern graffiti artist. The film avoids the ""who-did-what-first"" debate, but follows the progression from simple tagging to the more elaborate lettering that has led to the transformation of graffiti from an underclass counterculture movement into one that includes a broader artistic movement. The graffiti artists of New York in the \'70s and\' 80s talk about their exploits before the city began to aggressively clean up graffiti on public property. Other cities whose artists are present are: Paris, France; Amsterdam, Holland; London, United Kingdom; Berlin, Germany; Barcelona, \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bSpain; Cape Town, South Africa; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Tokyo, Japan; and Los Angeles, USA. I have always thought of graffiti as a means of frustrated, energetic, but above all irresponsible youth, who lashes out against what they perceive as the status quo. Now I have learned that graffiti art has a different meaning in different cultures. In South Africa, graffiti was a tool for political change. In Los Angeles, he was part of the Chicano movement and took on the entrapment of a lifestyle in some circles. In some cultures, the emphasis is more on putting works of art in public spaces than on counter-culture. It is not surprising that these artists have a less contradictory relationship with the communities and the law. The fact is that graffiti and vandalism have a profound effect on the rate of serious crimes. And many of the artists interviewed present themselves as extremely important people who inflict their spleen on others, because their lives are not as they would like. On the other hand, it can not be denied that graffiti is sometimes an improvement over shabby buildings, in ruins, or that artists have talent, or that some of the opponents of graffiti are politically naval philistines. `` Bomb It \'\' provides an introduction to graffiti and its controversies showing us art, ideas and differences of opinion. The DVD (Docurama 2008): there are 3 featurette and a feature commentary. In ""Behind the Scenes"" (14 min), director Jon Reiss talks about the genesis of the project, the shooting in different countries, the editing of the film and some themes. `` Extended Time Lapse Sequences \'\' (15 min) are 3 sequences, 5 minutes each in England, Brazil and Japan, where we can see the artwork created in accelerated times. There are also ""Extended Interviews"" (26 min). The audio commentary by director Jon Reiss and producer Tracy Wares is constant and informative. They talk about what they did and did not include in the film, their intentions and more details about who and what we are seeing.'",1

A great example is the portrait of Pacha's pregnant wife at home alone with two young children who ably use her children to counteract the antagonists. Surprising and extremely funny. As trivial as it may seem, this film & quot; it works on many levels & quot; providing intelligent humor for adults with great visual effects and jokes for children. And the theme of kindness and disinterest is done with unusual delicacy, without losing the message. For the rental price these days, the cost of owning the film is not much more, especially given the number of times we see it. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and happy to have looked beyond a premise that seemed absurd to enjoy one of the most creative films that have come from Disney for a long time.""",1
"b""I've been waiting for this movie to be republished for many years! And even though I'm happy to own it, I was so angry looking at him! I had memorized most of the lines, so even if I can not cite the entire extension of the missing footage, BOGGLES and annoys me why they removed some lines. Not only that, but the defective publisher has even dampened a scene! I do not know what problems he had with the main female character, but they must have been strict. I would like to have the director's son's address, so I could send him some hate or maybe even some roadkill in a box. If you publish a film, and this is what the fans have learned to know and love, we DO NOT DO IT ME.""",0

"b'Most films speak of Christ or Paul or Joseph or Moses. This film does not only concern Jesus, the Christ, but tells the personalities of the apostles themselves. It makes the observer understand that they have the same strengths and weaknesses as the apostles. Doubt Thomas. Peter and his temperament. Matteo . James and John, the sons of Zebedee. It concerns both the apostle and the Christ. The representation of the Last Supper and what every apostle must have thought when Christ announced that one of them would betray them is extremely moving. He made all these people very real and human for me.'",1
"b'Early Hackman, REALLY at the beginning Melanie Griffith. A cohesive and provocative screenplay that will keep you in good shape for a repeated vision. Interesting photography, especially underwater shooting. With Hackman you expect an excellent acting and you will not be disappointed in any of the cast. The nude scenes are well done, not brash and fall naturally into the plot. Good, solid, well-made film. The director must be complimented.'",1
"b""It seemed like I had not even been a tabloid employee for years to keep up with Britney Spears. His antics have not only been widespread in ALL magazine covers, but also in nightly national news! Also, you do not have to be a genius to understand that half the things in those magazines did not seem right enough, though. Finally Britney shows us a little look at what it means to be the most famous celebrity in the world. Some critics say that it does not really explain everything (why exactly did you shave your head?) How did this guy take control of his life?) He touches most of the highlights, but the life of the poor girl is public Enough - can we at least allow him to keep some secrets for himself? You're probably a Britney fan if you're watching this, so I doubt I have to convince you that his music is fantastic. I highly recommend this DVD not only because it is important for fans, but it is definitely a historical video that has caused one of the greatest comebacks of all time.""",1
"b'For the outline of the plot, here\'s how we read the back of the DVD: ""Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) is a private investigator specializing in unexplained supernatural phenomena: his cases go into the dark corners of the world, in search of truth in the hidden remains of the ancient civilizations Now, the greatest mystery of his past is about to become the most dangerous case he has ever faced - with the help of his ex-girlfriend, the archaeologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid) and her bitter rival, the government agent Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff), Edward is about to learn that just because you do not believe in something he does not believe I mean he can not kill you! ""According to the character of Carnby, the fear of darkness is what keeps us in life. Unfortunately, however, the fear of bad movies does not prevent us from renting them. Despite the horrible reviews, I decided to give in to the temptation to rent Alone In The Dark (I had a free rental, so I thought there was not much to lose). It was even worse than I expected ... First, the creatures that are unleashed from the depths of darkness - or whatever the holes in clich\xc3\xa9d horses are shoveled in history - are pathetic Dino della CGI beasts. Something interesting, scary or even simply ""cool"" about them? No . Only monsters generated by useless computers that fail to entertain the public in the slightest way. For two, acting is horrendous. Seeing Tara Reid on the DVD\'s headlines made me roll my eyes, but seeing her attempt to act as an archaeologist in a sci-fi action movie made me laugh. The only half-way recitation is given by Christian Slater, but it\'s still not enough to cover the rest. And for three, the film is terribly boring, with few action scenes. Oh sure, some unknown shots here and there, some flashing creatures on the screen, and a small gore is included. But real action? Very little . The small amount of action he has included is the reason I gave this two-star stinker. I hate to see a movie suffer, but it deserves it. In conclusion, do not make the same mistakes that most of these reviewers made by renting the film, knowing how terrible it must be. Just trust the ratings on this. It will save you money and time.'",0
"b""I bought it because I'm a big fan of cowboys and I thought it would be fun to learn some of the DCC routines. I have read the slightly negative reviews of other customers, but they are not in the best shape, so I thought it would be all right for me. First of all, the DVD is SHORT, about 45 minutes from start to finish. You only have a dance routine, which is divided into four parts. I was expecting some fun dance music (similar to what the cheerleaders perform), and it was a lame techno track all over the place. I also found some of the girls' voices particularly annoying. I did not feel excited or as if I had burned calories. All in all, this product was a big disappointment for me.""",0
"b""I bought the film by director Unrated of this film with great anticipation. I loved the theatrical version of Pitch Black. It's one of my favorite science fiction movies, without hands. But the Unrated Director's Cut? It's a waste of money. The additions to the film were so few and so subtle that I hardly noticed them. The Unrated part? More violence? Not greatly. More curses? More naked skin? No, none of those. And the extras? They are almost non-existent. There is nothing on this DVD that I have not seen on the first, except for some exaggeration on the sequel, and even this was very convincing. Seriously, if you already own this movie on DVD, do not waste your money on this reprint. If you do not own this movie on DVD, see if you can find the original version. At least he has theatrical trailers.""",0
"b""I can not tell a joke A bad joke is not fun, no matter who says it, but a person like me can make a good joke. A story must also be told well and, in the case of a film, shot well, to be interesting. The problem with AntiTrust is that it is a story not told or shot very well. It's beautiful to look at, but it has neither electricity nor soul. Milo [Ryan Phillippe] is a computer genius. Just out of college, he plans to start a business with friends outside a garage, just like their computer heroes did twenty years ago. They plan to make their mark in cyberspace. One day, apparently unexpectedly, Milo and his best friend are approached by Gary Winston [Tim Robbins], who wants them to come to work for his giant multinational company. It seems that Winston is about to launch a computer program that will revolutionize communications, but needs some good geeks to make it work. The friend, a young sage, decides to stick to his original plan, but Milo is sucked. Together with his girlfriend Alice [Claire Forlani], she packed up and moved to Portland, Oregon, home to the Winston Nurve Corporation. It is not long before Milo suspects that Winston will literally kill to get what he wants. Innovations in the programming of the new product always seem to happen immediately after the mysterious death of some brilliant programmer. One of the problems in the film is with some of the casting. Tim Robbins is as good as Winston, making him appear and behave as much as Bill Gates who is a bit spooky. Ryan Phillippe, however, I can not buy like any kind of genius. He did a good job in the past playing roles as a sociopath [Cruel Intentions], a psychopath [The Way of the Gun] and a boy in a party [54]. But a computer wizard? I do not think so Rachael Lee Cook is just as incredible as Lisa, a fellow programmer. Claire Forlani, who could be a star one day early, is fine like Alice, but she is a part that is well below her ability. AntiTrust belongs to the genre of paranoid thriller. This is the one in which only the hero has discovered a diabolical plot. Until the end of the film, the rest of the characters are almost always blind to the truth and tend to believe that the hero is simply stressed. The back window of Alfred Hitchcock is a classic example of this type of film. To be successful, the film must prompt the public to worry about the protagonist. It must concern him. This does not happen in AntiTrust. Milo is too bland and lame to keep our interest. It's one of those cases where, if we relate to someone, it's for the villain, Winston. At least it's smart and somehow fun. You know a movie is in trouble when we start cheering for the villico.""",0
"b'This is a very well done and well shot sequel. The opening sequence and the sequences with the snipers who were shooting indiscriminately at the fleeing crowd were memorable and well executed. However, I was completely annoyed at how simple it was for the father to access his wife who was supposed to be in some kind of quarantine. I know there are often errors in logic and suspensions of disbelief in many films and I am guilty of giving in to some of them. But this was very evident for me. To scream loudly, the US Military was completely incompetent or the filmmakers did not think it would be so resounding to the public. Who, sane, does not quarantine his mother with at least one guard at the door, let alone a nurse or a technician who watches her? ? ? ? ? ? Instead the structure was deserted. It was too simple for the father to access it with a card or not. If a person was still found alive 28 weeks later without symptoms in a quarantined area in the real world, that person would be blocked and monitored 24/7 video for days if not weeks because they want to know how she survived and how she was ""immune"" to this virus. Such precautions would never be taken into consideration in a light way, especially when it comes to a virus that has almost wiped out an entire country! If they did not have severe protomes we would have been swept away like a race a long time ago. The suspension of disbelief in this film really prevented me from enjoying a well done movie.'",0
"b""This film is a must - one that you can watch at least once a year. It's fun with excellent performances by Sig Weaver and Melanie Griffith. Although Melanie is a very normal actor, her style works in this film. The type of character required ie. a cheeky blonde meant that she really could be herself. In addition, her children's voice works for the role. Working Girl is a beauty comedy that focuses on an unlikely upward climb, but when you think about it carefully, show that anyone can get where they want, if they have determination and courage. This is a good message to cross, I feel. The Working Girl could have turned Melanie into a big star, but she did not open enough the doors she thought she would do. It could have more roles after this, but it was not worth looking at one of them! I refer to flop as Bonfire Vanities, Stormy Monday (plain urgh!), Shining Through, and one with former husband Don Johnson - the title escapes me. I think Melanie's inability to get rid of that little voice really killed her career.""",1
"b'I think this is a horrible video. The first 57 minutes teach you things like: - what is vibrato - how to make gavel, pull-off, trilli-A (G) major arpeggio (he plays it - no explanation like \'this is the root, then the 3rd, then the 5th, now I repeat it or something like that, it only plays an arpeggio. Great shout. chords decreased (he plays them with very few explanations apart from one has a fifth pot and the other has a shaved fifth - at the point says that if you want to know more you have to go buy a book!) -A George Van Eps lickOK, here is the what ... These are all EXTREMELY BASE. These are things that anyone who has played the guitar for more than a year or two should already know, for the most part. Maybe not inside and out, but he does not teach it inside and amp; out. For most of the above, it only provides an example with a minimal explanation. None of this has anything to do with Gypsy jazz. Oh, but for the last 2 or 3 minutes he plays a Gypsy jazz motif. He could have taken the exact same video and instead played a song by Yngwie Malmsteen at the end and called the video & quot; neoclassical solo & quot; and it would have been just like & quot; valid & quot; how to call this a gypsy jazz video! Now, I guess someone who wants to get into Gypsy Jazz already knows how to hammer and pull out. If they do not, they need to continue practicing for many years before hoping to deal with Gypsy jazz. So who is this video for? Does Paul Mehling know? There is absolutely no theory in this video. ANYTHING ! It does not tell you when to play scales and trills, etc. that shows you, or how they relate to agreements, or something else. There is no examination of the rhythmic positioning of the notes during the staging (this would be the SWING part of the gypsy swing guitar). There is no examination of which favorite django scales on which agreements, nothing like that. The video is & quot; Here are some basic techniques that should know all the beginner guitar students, now watch me play 1 piece of Django without any explanation. & quot; There is no dissection or tear of the Djangos style at all as suggested by another reviewer. Nothing like that. Nor is it a primer on jazz improvisation in my opinion. The sad thing is that this video may have been a lot more. Paul is obviously an excellent player and knows the style. But he does not teach it well. There are many excellent guitarists who do not make good teachers. Paul seems to be one of these. Someone should tell him! Now I\'m going to eBay to sell my video to someone else. I HIGHLY recommend to anyone else who is trying to get into this style the hotclub website for some basic lesson information, and Stan Ayeroff\'s book "" The Music of Django Reinhardt 44 classical solos of the legendary guitarist with a complete analysis & quot; MelBay Pub, ISBN: 0-7866-3388-3'",0
"b'Previously I used the Jillian DVD ""30 Day Shred"" and I wanted to change my routine. A friend told me about ""No More Trouble Zones"" and I decided to give it a try. NMTZ is definitely more difficult than the shred of 30 days! I like the variety of moves and this workout requires more reps with lighter weights. It\'s also nice that you can choose to play the whole workout or select different segments from the menu. Each segment is about 5-7 minutes long and focuses on certain areas such as abs / chest or core. The biggest disadvantage for me is that I used this DVD 2-3 times a week for about a month, and I did not notice any noticeable differences in ""problem areas"". I\'m already pretty fit - I run 3-4 times a week and I\'m careful about what I eat - but I was hoping this workout would help me strengthen a bit more. I\'m going to keep doing it though! I would also like to warn that if you prefer a workout without impact, without sweat, this DVD is not for you. When Jillian says ""you should feel like you\'re going to die"", he means ...'",1
"b'I will not dispute what the other reviewers have said, it\'s all this and more. Oh, and FORGET that filthy crap of ""We Are The World"", it was just an ego trip for B. Geldof. OK, having said that, please allow me to highlight my favorite part of ""Bangla Desh"": the version of Leon Russell of ""Jumpin \'Jack Flash"" (giving the Rolling Stones at least an unmissable ""exposure"") here) combined with that GREAT old chestnut of the Coasters, `` Youngblood. \'\' It\'s great, seeing Leon as a sort of jumpstart of other musicians with a higher number - but my favorite part is the sequel between `` JJF \'\' and `` Youngblood, \'\' and then - especially then - see and hearing ex- \'\' Mom \',\' Don Preston, almost unrecognizable with straight hair, sings the `` bridge \'\' in \'\' Youngblood \'\', the part where he sings, `` Hey, crazy little stuff ... \'\' That\'s Rock And Roll, folks.'",1
"b'I vaguely remember the game to which this film was titled and was a fan of some of the old Christian Slater films, so even after learning that it was a horrible film, I decided to rent it. I have a strange fondness for bad scifi movies because it\'s fun to see how ridiculous the writing is and how bad the special effects are, not to mention all the nameless actors who are trying to pretend they can act. Unfortunately this film was not fun in any way, shape or form. Christian Slater is a good actor and the film seemed to have a decent budget for the creatures, which were animated quite well, but apart from these two points this film did not even qualify for a `` direct to Sci-fi \'\' channel publication. There was no fun at all in this movie. The story made no sense, the supporting actors were very rigid and none of the characters seemed to care about any of the other characters. At one point in the film Christian Slater mentions ""I just killed my long friend"" the same way you said ""I just poured my coffee on a pair of stained pants that I was about to throw away"". . I guess it could sum up the whole movie. The actors did not seem to care, the director did not seem to care, the editors did not seem to care, in fact the only propio that seemed to really do a decent job were the animators who animated the monsters. After seeing this ""film"", I felt very sad for Christian Slater. His career must be completely over now. I am depressed . It\'s time to look at Madagascar and cheer me up.'",0

"b""As a parent, I really like seeing shows and films by Thomas. I like trains a lot and Thomas is the standard for children's train movies. However this film is a dramatic deviation and has a thoughtless plot decorated with absurdity. In short, Thomas moves by mistake on an island five miles directly off the Brendam docks. Despite the FIVE MILE submarine tunnel that connects Sodor to the island of Misty and the proximity to the shore, no one has seen the island of Misty. Thomas encounters new trains on the foggy island (Dash, Bash and Ferdinand) that have been sent into exile on the island to not really be useful and together they work hard to exploit an endangered tree to build a lifeboat station. In the end everything is resolved, but waste valuable time for logistical reasons to find some of the people who found Thomas before saving himself (if that makes sense). It should at least make sense to the writers that this was a horrible story. Also, introduced in this story is the Captain (a boat) who is the only one to have an English accent as all the people who sail have English accents. Finally, Hit Entertainment, which brings together the films of Thomas, means that to get to the film in reality another logistics challenge by removing the function of the `` menu '' button thus avoiding previews is possible only by pressing the `` skip button '' a million times. I thought I was paying for the film to not entertain the entertainment of suffocating my son with previews of their other products.""",0

And while the 2004 set was missing from the 3 ALDS games against the Angels, at least it was produced in HD. This set of World Series has been launched on the market, so much so that it is not in HD or widescreen, which are practically automatic on all DVDs today.

It suited the amount I had left to spend, so I ordered it to add to my new Blu-Ray collection.

No pop-up menus, no real selection of features and a video transfer that would be acceptable on a budget DVD, but not at 1080p. The director's intro looks like a worn VHS tape.

An ancient civilization once opened the door between these two worlds first and was swept away. Now, the key has been destroyed (why not destroyed? Never destroy these things!) And sent to the four corners of the earth. Now, take everything that's always been clean, exciting, fun, and interesting from an Indiana Jones-style movie and let it scroll down a few times.

"b'... first of all, I was looking for a DVD that would give me useful information on how to perform particular poses to reduce the pain in the neck / shoulders. I do not find a language like ""put your body on the ground in the earth"" and ""pull your shoulder blades into your heart"" very useful to make sure you\'re doing the poses correctly. Perhaps this DVD is meant for those with a background in yoga (in which case I would probably have chosen a slightly different title, as the current one has a good chance of attracting anyone looking for Amazon for neck / shoulder pain). Second - and this was the last straw camel for me - the instructor and his gracious partner went in deep squats ... and whoever was instructed to squat knows what this means: the knees of the male hovered on the floor * in front * of the toes.

I\'m still not sure I saw her dancing, because there were no close-ups and the picture was, as another reviewer noted, blurry. Audio problems were not simply a question of recording, but also of musical performance itself. The orchestra, the band or anything else that provided the accompaniment was not identified - for good reason.

The approach seems to be to throw in any fantastic characters writers can think of, regardless of how stupid or out of place The third season includes Medusa, a Caveman, The Flying Dutchman, The Abominable Snowman, a dinosaur that breathes fire, a dinosaur two-headed and a beetle whose bite makes you bad! Logic, continuity and characterization all go out of the window. Sleestak and Chaka talk, Enik does stupid things in the name of ""logic"". The only thing better this season is acting.

"b'After being deeply disappointed by Spirited Killer, I set my expectations much lower for this film. Unfortunately, it\'s even worse than Spirited Killer. History is not really worth going further. Basically there is someone who knows where a gem is. A bad general and his men want the stone and are trying to get it. There\'s also a group of good guys trying to find the guy who knows where the stone is. This is the history. Tony Jaa plays one of the villains and looks pretty good in his 2 fight scenes, but all the other fights are really bad. Some acrobatics are good, but not on par with most of the other Panna Rittikrai movies. Good guys have a Rambo type on their side and he drags the film down because his movements are very slow. But in general the main reason this film is so bad is because there are not many fights. I can bear a bad story until the fights are good, but this film does not. Even the grand finale is not worth staying. There are some decent explosions, but nothing to get excited about. Evaluation - 1/5. This film really makes you appreciate how much effort has been put into the ""Born to Fight"" Panna movies. The image quality is surprisingly good (well, good for Videoasia). There is a dub English HORRIBLE track, but luckily there is also a track and subtitles in the original language. The only reason why this 2-disc DVD set gets more than a 1-star rating is because of the special features. 4-minute interview with Tony Jaa talking about Tom Yum Goong. No new information here, but while he\'s talking they show a really interesting demonstration he\'s done on some TV show. 6-minute interview with Jaa talking about her inspiration for entering movies and a few other interesting topics. 10-minute interview on some Thai comedy TV show with Prachya Pinkaew, Jaa, Panna and Petchtai Wongkamlao. A fun demonstration of minutes and an interview that Jaa did in Hong Kong. Good things here, but nothing you have not seen before if you\'re a Jaa fan. One-minute interview with the producer of Pechpanna Films and a director / actor for the company. Fantastic interview! They talk about really interesting things, such as a new Thai film called The Brave. It\'s not subtitled and the dubbing is really poor, but it actually makes it more enjoyable (at least for me). And there are some good action scenes mixed in the interview.3 Interview with Tony Jaa. It seems they are just trying to accumulate special features with this. The only thing to talk about is a 1 minute demo showing at the end of the interview. But no less important is an interview with Christoph Kluppel, a great German Rambo who plays in the Battle Warrior. He talks about his film career. I suppose it would be interesting if I were a fan of her.'",0
"b'This did not get rave reviews on his original film release and while he did respectable business on the art house circuit he never made big commercial shots. Yet this warm, tender and unpretentious film has long lasted in popular affection. he has strong cast and solid support actors who have always been a feature of British cinema.Yet his popularity is not only at the bottom of these factors, but rather to his generosity of spirit.It is not deep.It is not sophisticated.It is the cinema as a comfort food and its world is the world of daily struggles and silent triumphs over adversity. He positively affirms the identity of the white gay working class and uses humor to project his message, rather than employ a wrinkled forehead and beat the ""message"" broadly. He is in and around a working class residential neighborhood. in London and centers around 2 years -, Jamie (Glen Barry) and Ste (Scott Neal). Establishes in its opening scene, the school plays in the fields, the contrast between the boys. Jamie hates sports and tries to get out of the games. He loves old movies (there\'s a picture of Lucille Ball on his bedside table) and reads celebrity and gossip magazines. He\'s definitely not ""one of the boys"" and he\'s bullied and labeled gay. But he loves sports and he\'s good with them - when he first saw an Arsenal football shirt. He enters and the contrast between the two is reinforced later on a scene in which Ste joins in an informal kickabout while Jamie sits disconsolately on the edge. We are given a non-verbal clue that the two boys, while they are not friends at school, get along well. In both of the above scenes, Ste glances at Jamie with sympathy, an expression of ""excuse for these saws"" on his face. For Ste, home is the problem. He and Jamie both live in single-parent homes but have wildly conflicting experiences of this. father and brutal older brother, while Jamie is loved in a captivating and honest way by his mother Sandra - the excellent Linda Henry. And Jamie is able to speak verbally but the love and support he gives is real and unyielding and is ambitious for a new and better life for both of them and wants to run his pub rather than being in a maid. What we get in the film is a classic romantic narrative, but it involves only two guys as they realize, not just that they are gay, but they attract each other. Too many people of his father, Ste, are greeted by Sandra and invited to ""top and tail"" with Jamie. The following scene is among the most tender and engaging of the whole cinema. I repeat: in the cinema, not only in gay cinema. The scene is not explicit, but tender and loving, fraught with hesitations and hesitations (just like so many first encounters) and painfully moving. We will then see the contrasting impact of the meeting on the two boys - Jamie grows in self-esteem and Ste are struggling to reconcile his sexuality with his status as ""one of the boys"" and frightened by the fact that his father and his brother find out. The main reason for the film is ""going out"". and visually the film is surprisingly subtle. Producer Tony Garnett has been a great television producer and there is a slightly television-like feeling for the pictures, particularly the shots of the desolate property, but then the scenes will be lit by a rainbow and attempts of residents to revive the area with window baskets etc. This is never just a melting pot in social realism and the sense of unreality is sometimes deliberate. The main actors are not big chunks in the sense of Hollywood. They are sweet, cute even, but quite ordinary K ids in looks and aspirations, which makes an easy movie for gays to relate to. He also notes suggestions that Sandra has a gay side - his closest relationship is not with the boy Tony but his working partner Louise. It has the reputation of sexual predator and looks like crazy and with a pinch of sexual ambiguity. The challenge of prejudice in the dance that characterizes the last scene is clear and more than just a lioness who defends her puppies from prejudice. Add a warm, exuberant performance from Tamara Empson Leah, a tormented young teenager whose fixation for Mama Cass is the excuse for a glorious music from the soundtrack. It is a celebration of the output. It is open and charming. I have a deep affection for this film, even if it is not a great cinema, it is life and I like to say. And that counts for a whole lot in my book. I\'ve seen him since he says two groups often mocked in the cinema -gay and white collar. This is a pleasure'",1
"b""Labeled as an urban fable, this film is about a young rebel, who apparently was ignored by his grandfather right now to read the will. All family members are gathered to read the last will of what was once a wealthy business man and successful executive. Jason's grandfather has prepared every speech through a posthumous DVD in which each of his heirs dies to know what he is doing around the piece of cake they deserve. Finally, when this rebel without cause and immature nephew will receive, it will be a series of challenges that he will have to overcome to earn the final gift. During the journey, he will receive a life lesson that will lead him to a jump to experience, face and face the raw reality of life, and so, he will follow his happiness. Film tender, moving and fun that will surely seduce you.""",1
"b'This is one of the most entertaining and touching movies around. Jessica Tandy was a sweetheart and Kathy Bates was so funny in a role that I could certainly identify with. I want to correct some incorrect information in a post two from me! Fannie Flagg Is the author of the book on which the film is based ... but it is not Patricia Neal, the main character of HUD. Patricia Neal was the name given to Fannie, but when she acted in acting, the name was obviously taken, so her father told her to invent a memorable name. Fannie Flagg is nothing if not memorable. She is a very funny woman ... and an excellent author. The film deserves to be reviewed.'",1
"b""Far from the usual vision of many war films of the era, TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH deserves its reputation. You do not have twelve attacks every fifteen minutes just to create an action for the action. What you have is a realistic war story that confronts men who risk their lives and become obsessed with the fear of not going back. GREGORY PECK gives a great performance, strong and even vulnerable to the end. Considering that this film was made in 1949, it is certainly a classic. If you love war movies with a lot of action, a girl and a vision of HOLLYWOOD, do not see this film, it is simply beyond you.""",1
"b'The ""Prisoner of Zenda"" of 1922 is certainly one of the best silent films ever made. His main actors knew that it was better not to overdo it and he obviously had a very competent director in Rex Ingram. Although the plot, costumes and scenarios are straight out of an operetta, the players mostly appear natural, showing that good acting was not something that somehow emerged with the advent of sound. Even Ramon Navarro as Hentzau\'s evil Rupert shows that he is more than a beautiful face as he transforms his role into a droll, an animated tour de force. The image begins in the house of the Englishman Rudolph Rassendyll, the camera zeroing in on the extremely beautiful eyes of Lewis Stone, now a 43-year-old veteran who, in many other respects, looks like an ordinary middle-aged man in physical condition exquisite. But, of course, there is nothing ordinary about Stone\'s histrionic talent and, moreover, has all the charm that made him as much loved as Judge Hardy about 15 years later in the series ""Andy Hardy"". Rassendyll decides to attend the coronation of his cousin, Rudolph of Ruritania, [whose twin could be] and finds his relative a dispelled disaster. Lewis Stone plays both sides, needless to say. The future weak king has an ambitious but evil brother, the Duke Michael, who plots to conquer the throne for himself and kill Rudolph in the process. On the eve before the coronation, the duke orders his brother to be drugged so that he is not in any way involved in the ceremony. Therefore, the loyalists of the king persuade the British Rassendyll to take his place for a day and prevent Michael from doing his way. The Ruritarian Rudolph has a beautiful girlfriend played by the luminous Alice Terry. The couple does not have much to do with each other, but it is a popular princess that would serve to strengthen Rudolph\'s shaky position. However, Rassendyll and the beautiful girl immediately catch each other and, perceiving an unexpected change in its intent, the princess no longer sees her role as future queen as a simple duty. Of course, the plot thickens and there is another woman involved, played by the seductive but less natural actress, Barbara La Marr. Rudolph Rassendyll can not go home to England after the coronation, but must stay to help save his endangered royal cousin. There is also a large number of twisted pairs and a sword game. Everybody creates a fascinating film and it\'s a real revelation to see how effective a younger version and the old Judge Hardy\'s fawn eyes look like in love scenes. Pretty sexy! It is probably no coincidence that the actor who played the dual role in the upcoming ""Zenda Prisoner"", Ronald Colman, looked a lot like Lewis Stone.'",1
"b'When I saw the trailer for & quot; From the hell & quot; I was understandably ecstatic. Based on a graphic novel with the same name, written by Alan Moore, I really had high hopes for this. Judging from the previews, it seemed that the Hughes brothers could do it justice. But unfortunately, as often happens for the film adaptations of the books, they have massacred them. Let\'s start with the character of Johnny Depp, the inspector Abberline. They transform it from an honest and industrious detective who slowly develops some feelings for a young prostitute, into an ophthalmic clairvoyant who falls madly in love with the prostitute (Heather Graham). And speaking of Heather Graham, could they make a more horrible choice for a nineteenth-century prostitute? The other prostitutes in the film look, well, how they should (ugly), but Graham sticks out like a sore thumb. Regarding the story, this butcher is typical of the great Hollywood movies. The book focused on the character of Jack the Ripper more than anyone else in history. Indeed, it was revealed in Chapter 2! This is what made him so fascinating: the book entered the killer\'s head and tried to explain the reasons for his gruesome murders, in addition to the obvious ones presented in the film. He deconstructed and analyzed a truly twisted mind and tried to convey how, in the words of Alan Moore, & quot; The human experience went to the limit ... then it went beyond ""quot ;. The film turns into a typical whodunit, which makes you think until it is revealed at the end.Anyway, I sang long enough Watch the movie if you want - for pure fun, you\'ll probably like it, but if you want a story rich in plot and fascinating, even if fictional, on one of the most famous serial killers of all time, read the book.'",0
"b'I remember it as if it were yesterday. I was 24 when this movie came out and I lived in Miami, Florida. I had long hair (very long) and I went out with a real bomb. So the weekend that came out of this movie was dragged me into this movie by my girlfriend. In reality it was a group of us, three couples and all the boys were dragged by their girlfriends. The 24-year-old, the guys with long hair in heavy metal music are not the type suited to a chick movie, so none of us was thrilled to be there. To make the film a little more enjoyable we were in a slightly ""altered"" state. \'\' But this little film won us over! And none of us were single at the time. I\'m also very attached to Matt Dillon\'s character because it\'s exactly how I was living my life at the time. I can not add anything more than what others have said, since the film works so well because it is not mushy, it is not forced, it is not cliche and it is not trivial. There was only something so honest and natural in the film. And even though I was seriously angry at the time for the advent of grunge music that killed the precious heavy metal that I liked so much, I ended up enjoying music too. This was the real grunge, before the music companies turned grunge into the top 40 of the commercialized crap, and before the designers / producers of clothing transformed the clothes of the second hand stores into expensive high-end designer dresses. It really aroused my interest in Seattle and I remember wanting to move them for a few years after watching this movie (never done). As my title says, this is a perfect movie even kids will like because it escapes all the classic ornaments of the typical chick movie. The acting and writing are top notch, as are the music and the city of Seattle itself. Since then I have seen the film in an undisturbed state and has lost none of its charm, originality and innocence. This film captures a fun, innocent, carefree, fresh and exciting time, before the information bubble, before September 11th, before record gas prices and before the explosion of our entire economy. Not only do today\'s 20 people do not have a movie like Singles to call, they do not have much future to look forward to.'",1
"b'An old stripper exercises great powers over others with the help of a mysterious amulet in SIN, YOU SINTER. The word ""aging"" seems a kind way to put it. Judging from things, the middle-aged middle-aged mother\'s lease is about to expire soon, although this fact does not seem to threaten his grip on manager Dave and his daughter. Nor do the saints preserve us, prevent them from grinding and beating about every 15 minutes. Dave, Mama has bought and paid children\'s toys, is his manager and drummer when he is doing his second job as a spiritualist amulet that specializes in caring for the rich. Dave has a crush on her daughter too, and her 20-something daughter has Dave\'s ass, but neither can outrage a hormone while her mother wears the amulet. Even if the mother, the saints preserve us, get to shimmer and shake in her skimpy bikini with the bangs on top, this is not really a blue film. Beyond terrible, I do not know what it is or how to explain it. The second howler on this DVD, the reason I took it into consideration, is Lenny Bruce, scripted and played by a vehicle (the only true film I\'ve ever seen) DANCE HALL RACKET. It is a ballroom that blocks his client and the hall dancers that balance the direction. Bruce is revered by the stand-up comedians as a cutting edge, current and pioneering genius of the first order. It could all be like that, but his first film credited as a screenplay can not stand it. No up, no jokes, no ha-ha in this. Stink . The fact that the transfer press was in bad condition is not helpful, and at some point between 1953 and today someone cut out all the short nudist shots in the girls\' dressing room. Losing the quick glances is not a big deal, but it distorts the soundtrack and the dialogue and makes some conversations even more ridiculous than I imagine would be otherwise. Two smelly for the price of one. Not recommended as entertainment, although this is probably the best chance to see a walk and talk with Lenny Bruce. If this does not do it for you, avoid this DVD like the plague.'",0
"b'Adam Sandler turns into a great performance in this sequel to ""Magnolia"" by director Paul Thomas Anderson. Emily Watson is equally good.

Little by little, they develop a relationship and start dating. Meanwhile, Barry is going through a dilemma with a ring of telephone sex workers. All this leads to a beautiful finale in the best film I\'ve seen throughout the year. I will have this DVD. I highly recommend this movie!'",1
"b'While ""Singin \'in the Rain"" of 1952 is definitely the most complete musical film, I think this exuberant classic of 1949 represents what MGM produced during the golden age of Hollywood when the talents were at their peak. Co-directed by Gene Kelly and a twenty year old Stanley Donen in his directorial debut, the film has a constantly propulsive energy, thanks above all to the remarkable choreography of Kelly and Donen, the perfect blend of Leonard Bernstein\'s family music with the original compositions of Roger Edens and the pure exuberance of the artists. Written by the reputable team of Betty Comden and Adolph Green, the lisa plot consists of about three sailors - Gabey, Chip and Ozzie - on a 24-hour leave in New York City and the women they meet and romance. Based on a subway poster, Gabey\'s woman falls in love with Miss Turnstiles and spends her time looking for her. Ozzie, an insane ride, finds romance with the anthropology student Claire, while Timid Chip focuses on tourism despite the insistent attentions of the aggressive taxi driver Hildy. The closest thing to the dramatic tension is in the deception of Miss Turnstiles, who is not the most successful celebrity, but Gabey believes she is an aspiring dancer named Ivy, who has to work at night as an exotic dancer at Coney Island. it is obviously at its best when it focuses on the musical sequences - starting with the real places used for ""New York, New York"" ""in establishing the energetic arrival of the sailors, continuing with the elaborate"" Prehistoric Man ""number at the History Museum Natural and bouncing through the title music ensemble with all six principals singing and dancing their way down from the Empire State Building.Everyone has a chance to shine, albeit like Gabey, Gene Kelly clearly dominates with her Fascinated athletics Like Chip, Frank Sinatra obscures mainly to sing Betty Garrett, which admirably contains his elegance as Hildy. Although hardly credible as an academic type, Ann Miller arrives to impress impressively during ""Prehistoric Man"", and Jules from the rubber face Munshin mainly provides relief from comedy like Ozzie.When dancing rather than acting to trick Gabey, Vera-Ellen astonishes like Ivy from the ""M iss Turnstiles Ballet "", full of fantasy, to his superb duets with Kelly in"" Main Street ""and"" A Day in New York Ballet ""\'. The only discordant note is the paternalistic attitude towards Hildy\'s roommate, Lucy (played with a pinch of Gewys Kravitz from ""Bewitched"", Alice Pearce). Harold Rosson\'s color-saturated cinematography was kept pretty well in the transfer of the 2000 DVD release, although the only extra is the theatrical theatrical trailer.'",1
"b""My children love this film and they watch it in their sleepers with their friends. Don Knotts plays Luther Hegg, a shy typographer in a small town in the mid-west (Rachel, Kansas). The secondary actors are top notch: Skip Homeier, Dick Sargent, Ellen Corby etc. Joan Staley, who plays Alma, was hit by PLAYBOY in 1958! Vivian Vance's ex husband, Phil Ober, plays the killer and the elderly in the board are hilarious. Reta Shaw is very funny as head of the Psychic Society and Vic Muzzy's soundtrack is disturbingly disturbing. When this photo was first released in theaters in 1965, it was a great success in the small cities of the United States and is very representative of the American town of the 60s. Fun!""",1
"b'Fully agree with all the favorable reviews here. A huge alarm bell for the American public to get more information on the food industry.

"b'My expectation of this film was that it would have been more or less a compilation and reinforcement of the information I had gathered after watching the movie ""Fast Food Nation"" many years ago, and having just finished reading the excellent books. `Animal, Vegetable Miracle \'and` `In Defense of Food\' \'among others. However, this film is more than the sum of those books and that movie. Food Inc. is an extremely well done documentary partly because of the personal stories told by the interviewees, as well as the hidden camera footage. I was particularly impressed by what is happening to the farmers. The material is so well studied and presented. Many aspects of the production, marketing and consumption of food are covered. There is no ""time out"" in this film, it is a success after another. All shocking and important information that citizens must be concerned about. Congratulations to all those involved in making this incredibly important film. Thanks to those who blocked the neck to tell the truth. Yes it\'s disturbing, but you need to watch it.'",1
"b""The adventures of three girls in the show. ZIEGFELD GIRL is a huge backstage musical in which MGM has poured tons of talent; he also scored Pandro S. Berman's first assignment with that studio after his successful years at RKO. The reason why Jimmy Stewart received the award for this rather irregular but funny film is a mystery: his role is practically secondary. Robert Z. Leonard directed this two-and-a-half-hour pedigree, triumph, pain, and music, but the two biggest production numbers, MINNIE FROM TRINIDAD and BETWEEN A DREAM, were the work of the legendary magician of cinematic choreography, Busby Berkeley. Judy is as dear as Susan Gallagher and her scenes with her Irish Pop (Charles Winninger) are realistically performed. I heard that Lana Turner's performance is a bit artificial and inept in her acting technique; She plays Sheila, who succumbs to the bottle. Like Sandra, Lamarr is surprisingly beautiful, but his acting hardly lingers in someone's memory! Jimmy Stewart would enlist in the army before this preview movie; he would not have made another film until 1946; he was a sleeper (joking) titled IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.""",1
"b""This review is for the DVD edition of the film Criterion COllection. The original French title of the film is & quot; Du Rifiif Chez les Hommes & quot; which translates to & quot; Problems with men & quot; The film is really beautiful and talks about several men plotting to enter a jewelry store, open the safe and run away - all without alarm. Several scenes have been imitated in other films: in particular, Mission Impossible and the remake of Italain Job. Many scenes are quite exciting and the break-in scene is very exciting. This half-hour scene does not contain dialogue, making it one of the longest, if not the longest, of the time spent without dialogue in a film with dialogues. This is definitely one of the best running-in films I've seen and is definitely worthy of a Criterion Collection version. There are also several special features. There is a theatrical trailer, production stills and notes, a video interview with the director, Jules Dassin, who has also personally learned this edition, and drawings of the sets by Alexandre Trauner. There is also an optional English language soundtrack for those who are bothered by the foreign language with subtitles. However, this is a film that no fan of the robbery films should lose!""",1
"b'This is a dark, creepy, mysterious film in which the writer has not gone too far with the plot. Often in films like this, writers make the last mysterious solution incredibly complicated and unrealistic. This film, on the other hand, is complex enough to make it intriguing, while keeping the index of realism high. As much as I liked this film, I will say that Sean Connery is one of the main reasons. Without him, the film would probably have lost a star. This is one of its best performances. F. Murray Abraham is also at his best, as the incredibly wicked inquisitor. Christian Slater is not bad. The other actors in the film seem to have been found by a show going crazy or have had the best makeup artist ever. What a strange bunch! The film does not distort the blood and describes very little violence. Torture and murder generally take place outside the screen. The Catholic church definitely has a black eye here. All monks and clergy (apart from Sean C.) are referred to as at least 3 of the following: wicked, serious, sexually active (hetero and gay) and generally very stupid. However, I like to think that much is due to the century (14) in which mystery occurs, and therefore things were much more primitive. However, Catholics can be offended if they are not already desensitized by all the other films that characterize the Catholic clergy. The mystery itself is a good movie that should make you guess. Sean Connery is the only logical person in the film, and is your tour guide to the solution. I liked the movie, as I think most will do it. Manage your expectations, because this is a good movie, but not one of the biggest.'",1

This number alone will give you chills and even if you\'re a guy you\'re wondering how it would be like to decline on a glamorous scale. It is the production number that you do not want to end. It\'s just beautiful. Even the whole movie is great, but the last scene before the final issue of the real Lana Turner fasion steals the film. In this scene she is seriously ill and leaves the theater while Tony Martin sings ""You came out of a dream.""

"b'`` Elvis: That\'s Is It It Is \'\' captures King Presley in an interesting intersection of his career. With his true talents largely wasted after too many years in Hollywood, Elvis found himself usurped as the ""King of Rock and Roll"" by the likes of The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. This documentary, shot in the summer of 1970 as she was preparing for an engagement at the International Hotel in Las Vegas, finds Elvis ready and in optimal condition to reclaim his throne! The documentary shows him at age 35, fit and tidy, and has a lot of fun! Seeing Elvis having fun: it is already a joy in itself! Elvis had a good sense of muscianship and his art. He expected a lot from the people he worked with; and he knew exactly how to get the best out of everyone. Here it is obvious that Elvis loved working with his band and his back-ups; and they loved working with him. Elvis criticized in a kind and funny way. When his band is having trouble with the central section of ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"", Elvis comments: ""If it goes this way, it goes this way, but we do not have to emphasize it."" The concert footage itself shows that Elvis could very well be been the hardest working man in the entertainment world. It also proves that Elvis had ""it"" - that indefinable, often indescribable X-Factor (or, in his case, factors) that marks the difference between an entertainer and a superstar. Elvis was a superstar with a capital ""S"": he possessed a powerful combination of charisma, sex appeal, musicality and spectacularity. Elvis\'s charisma, in particular, burns the stage quite enough. Elvis does everything possible to please his audience. During a long interpretation of ""Love Me Tender"", he enters the audience, kissing many women and shaking hands with as many men as possible. He sings a Greatest Hits Medley largely for laughter (changing the lyrics to ""forget the past before kicking # #""). In the middle of the concert, Elvis has just begun, offering grandiose performances of ""In the ghetto"", ""You lost that feeling of love"" and ""Polk Salad Annie"". \'\' His extended, super-charged, super-sweaty version of `` suspicious minds \'\' will probably leave viewers as exhausted as Elvis at the end. As the credits roll, we see Elvis greeting the other celebrities after the show. Sammy Davis, Jr., clearly in awe, observes: ""Friend, you made an impression and you never stopped!"" When congratulating on a wonderful show, Elvis responds modestly, ""Well, it was a sweaty show."" The DVD special edition includes two versions, but it sticks to the most recent restored version and skips the original theater version of 1970. The 1970 theatrical version has testimonies of fans that are not needed.The restored version has more footage of Elvis in action `` Elvis: That\'s Way It Is \'\' is the way Elvis should always be remembered!'",1

By pressing the MENU button on the remote control, playback will only flicker for half a second. Pressing the GUIDE button on the remote will switch to a blank screen that does nothing and remains empty. TRANSFER is horrible. It seems as if they had set up a recording device to record directly onto DVD a direct projection of the film on an economic screen. There are even scratches and stains on the film and the whole screen is blurred and distorted beyond recognition. The sound is muffled as if you were in a padded cell listening through a tin can. The dubbing of the British accents on the dialogue really throws you out when you use strange phrases. The acting is non-existent. It seems as if it was cut together quickly and there are several scenes missing. In one scene, you see Jackie Chan walking down the street in a market and a few moments later you're cut off from his character's father in the middle of an action scene while the house burns around him. The quality of the film is less than what you would get by recording something via CBS without a cable. HORRIBLE RECEPTION HERE! My recommendation: DO NOT DRINK!""",0

"b'If you\'ve never seen an upcoming movie, this is the one to choose from. One of the most critically acclaimed gay films, it\'s a delicate, thoughtful, tender and sweet story with a superb Mama Cass score. The film was also hailed as a good representation of the working class in British society. The film directed by Hettie McDonald and based on the screenplay by gay writer Jonathan Harvey portrays the relationships between people in a large residential complex located east of London (I was physically there). Mainly for low income, the British working class, the film revolves around three families, all houses destroyed. Ste, coming from a father and a family of brothers who abuse; Jaime, a mother and a family engaged; and Leah, an English black girl with her mother. The story is the development of a gay love relationship between two guys, Ste (played by Scott Neal) and Jaime (played by Glenn Berry). They both live next to each other. They are both 16 (even in real life to maintain accuracy). It is also the story of Leah, sometimes drug addict, disturbed, abandoned teenager. He is a catalyst with his obsession with the music of Mama Cass, constantly sings his songs and makes a lot of noise around the apartments. I read messages in this movie chat room about her, not understanding why she is the movie. His character contributes to the greatness of the film. He has been beaten several times by his father and his brother. He takes refuge in Jaime\'s house. Jaime\'s mother, Sandra (played superbly by Linda Henry). She loves Jaime dear and has left her husband due to physical abuse. She is a hard, nonsense, caring and loving woman who runs the local bar / club in this apartment complex. She feels sorry for Ste and brings it inside Ste must sleep in Jaime\'s bed or in a couch. Then one thing leads to another, Jaime kissing Ste.There is a trip to a local gay bar, more kisses in the woods. Sandra finds out that her son has lied to her about his love for Ste. She is informed by the school principal that Jaime is teased and called ""fagot"". ""And the film comes to its final moments: You play Mama Cass\'s music at night when she\'s tall and almost falling off the condo\'s balcony, and Ste realizing that Sandra knows about them while Sandra has been offered a better job to handle a pub in another part of East London, greets her boyfriend and gets ready to spend the evening with the girls Ste, Jaime and Leah are getting ready to go back to the gay bar The final scenes of the movie show Ste and Jaime they dance (on a melody of Mama Cass\'s music) in an open area of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bthe apartment buildings while the tenants get together to watch the whole thing, some in a ruckus, Sandra goes out on the balcony, next to Leah, watching what\'s going on underneath One of the best scenes I\'ve ever seen in a film of any kind is the extension of Leah\'s hand to Sandra (symbolism is so powerful.) By the way, Sandra and Leah fight like dogs and cats throughout the movie, they repair in the last moments i have joined Ste and Jaime in the dance, and Sandra finally accepts her son\'s sexuality. It is a very powerful film and the title is very appropriate. Both Glenn and Scott stated in interviews that they received thousands of letters after the film asked if they were gay. Glenn disappeared from the screen and Scott did some minor things. Sometimes language is difficult to understand. There are websites with the dictionary of jargons used by the working class in Britain. Someone put a screenplay for a sequel on the Internet, it\'s pretty good. This is a ""GREAT"" movie'",1
"b'They do not make them like this anymore. This is really shabby. In reality, sex far exceeds violence. And the many sex scenes are quite graphic, at the limit of hardcore. It\'s also ugly, particularly in the massage scene, where a sadist beats a woman with his belt. One SCREAM IN THE STREET revolves around the fight of two policemen against the criminal scum - thieves, a voyeur and a disguised serial killer, that looks HORRIBLE. And his women victims are not too smart, since she approaches her as a very unconvincing ""woman"", and they (including a single-colored female detective!) Do not even notice! Like many police films of his time, A SCREAM ... has a position of self-justice openly. Watch out for the final scene, which also makes good use of split screen technique, which was very popular in the early 70s. As you have probably guessed, this is not politically correct and therefore very fun! The image quality is very impressive. SWV did a great job with the transfer. As usual the SWV DVD offers many extra features. There is obviously the movie trailer, which includes movies not shown in the film. All in all, there are a dozen trailers, both for the exploitation of the United States and for the old French criminal films. My favorite trailer is THE GODSON with Overbusty Uschi DIGARD (soon to be released on DVD). A ""play all"" option for trailers would have been useful. Five short films are also included, which I liked IL PROWLER. Since I\'m a real criminal, this black-and-white movie of the 1960s for police officers was very interesting to me. Also interesting is CRIME IN THE STREET, an educational documentary on crime prevention with a young Chuck NORRIS (therefore a karate trainer). The film is funny but somewhat useless, because all the advice given is so well known and common sense. I did not really like the other three short films. HARRY NOVAK, CRIME BUSTER is a kind of documentary, in which a film crew visits producer Harry NOVAK. After joking about NOVAK (joking) he suggests visiting a business partner, who paid with a crazy check. NOVAK wields a samurai sword and a rifle to improve his arguments. Strange commercial habits ... Another short film is a sex film extremely stupid, boring beyond imagination and due to a horrible print quality almost unwatchable. The last short film is a black and white burlesque striptease. Boring, and by the way: you can not see something. As for the extensive Harry NOVAK movie gallery, it\'s better. Buy the DVD but skip the last three shorts in extra features.'",1
"b""This is a film that speaks more of redemption than of purebred problems. Kowalski lives in a run down area of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bDetroit, where he is a retired motorist and a Korean War veteran. He is an old gruff who despises everything and apparently everyone. His nieghborhood is totally Hmong, with the only exception being him. We see him with his family, and interacting with his neighbors and then as you saw in the trailers, his relationships with local youth. He begins a relationship with Thao and Sue, the young Hmong neighbors to whom he builds affinities. Totally politically incorrect, Kowalski spreads racist and ethnic insults in almost every sentence. He's a bit of a borrower, especially since he became a widower, but he enjoys his car and his house and wants his world not to have changed that much. Kowalski calls all the names, their faces and does not really care what kind of getting up gets people out. In practice offends evryone, whites, blacks, Hispanics, Asians. But you see the youth gangs from a variety of ethical perspectives and their own racism. Tao and Sue are like those you hear about in the news, children who have problems coming over them, simply because they live in these areas. Kowalski knows the Hmong and they him. He defends his house, his property and his friends. Realism, even if surreal, has our senses influenced when we see the results of combat. Sometimes, it leads to something more. Kowalski, although a figure of redemption, affects all those who know him at the end, yet the greatest impact is on the spectator of the Gran Torino. The extras on the DVD are good, more on cars than on the company. I wish there were more in the city center and gang problems in this to complete our love story with the big muscle machines.""",1
"b'I bought this thinking that I would have a bet from one of my childhood favorites, Hollywood and the stars. It is not so. (Ah, the dangers of online purchases ...) This record contains three chapters (called ""episodes"") consisting of footage from the World War II newsreel, but the resemblance to Hollywood and the Stars ends here. Instead of the narrative from the inimitable Joseph Cotten, we are treated with occasional commentary by Eric Sevareid. Of course, Mr. Sevareid is a legend among journalists, but he will not interrupt if one expects Joseph Cotten (not to mention the wonderful theme music of Elmer Bernstein). If you need to buy it, just risk it and because its content is not ""Hollywood and the Stars"" is of interest to you, and not to the list (I got it cheap enough from a third-party seller of Amazon, but any waste money is painful for me). For what it\'s worth, I noticed that it is reproducible in all regions, but I do not know if it will convert from NTSC to PAL. My advice is not to worry about trying to find out.'",0
"b'`` Lost Highway \'\' is not linear, and therefore satisfying for our narrative desire, like ""Mulholland Drive"", because in fact it seems too difficult to be strange. But David Lynch is one of the few directors who understands how weirdly can be dreamlike cinema. Like Hitchcock, he exploits this situation for all its value, but in the manner of the classic surrealists, and I think this film can best be experienced in the context of a real theater. The plot of the film is even more deeply subconscious than `Mulholland Drive \', because his last subject seems to be the act of watching a narrative film itself, channeled through a model of truth in our society: crime scene photos. This is what makes it interesting. It is so open, however, that it allows each viewer to have his own personal interpretation, because the ""surface plot"" is mixed with his own interpretative clues ... My opinion is that Fred Madison believes he was convicted of killing his wife based on the images contained in the last videotape that is delivered to him and Renee (Patricia Arquette); during the first act, the most important line is his statement that he does not like cameras because he prefers to remember things in his own way - ""not necessarily in the way they happened."" \'This whole first part of the film is the way which Fred remembers his life before being jailed, and takes place in the space of a second - after he was punched in the face by the arrested police officer. way of convincing himself that he did not - that the Mystery Man (Robert Blake as wifekiller - ironic, eh?) actually done.The second part, less effective thanks to the lighter tone, is the way in which Madison escapes the reality of the electric chair.The light above his cell flickers and buzzes like someone is supposedly executed, which triggers his fantasy to escape physically becoming another person, yet even in this man\'s life he is better off ne, Ren\xc3\xa9e returns (as a double ...?) And is free to start a life with her without the memory of his marriage, but learn the sordid truth about his life ... Mystery Man shows up again, this time helping him to commit a conscious murder of his former pimp - and allowing it to be filmed to convince himself that this murder (which Fred might have committed before the film began) was right. But who the hell knows ... The plot? I mapped this film after I saw it the first time and there are too many duplicates that we as spectators can not trust as physical reality or mental projection. Each interpretation focuses on the other - like the Moebius strip that Lynch claims the film embodies. It\'s more like a puzzle structured around themes, mainly a subtext that involves photography: the photo of the twins, the porn movies, the gruesome videotapes that appear on the doorstep as bad business cards. Make sure you have a letterbox version of this movie; Lynch\'s visual compositions are based on horizontal angles everywhere, and there are many extreme close-ups in which the upper heads are truncated (for some malicious intent, I\'m sure). The cinematography is exceptional and the soundtrack (not the music, but the atmosphere that Lynch has always meticulously done) is as important as the images, just like in ""Eraserhead"". `` And after seeing a particular scene in this movie, you\'ll pay close attention to the glass tables with sharp edges for the rest of your life ...'",1
"b""Yes, my first copy had the audio problem, but the replacement worked well, so do not be afraid to buy this nice introduction to a neglected horror star. In his very theatrical way, Tod Slaughter was fun as Karloff or Lugosi and, as some reviewers have noted, no actor has ever enjoyed himself so badly (with a capital B)! FACE is probably his best and BARN is his first; both films are eminently recognizable with good image quality. So, give Europe's horror horror a chance; if you love scary movies from the 1930s and 40s, chances are you will not regret it. I, for example, hope to see more Slaughter on DVD.""",1
"b'The video and audio transfer of the aged DVD version is excellent. Although the original film was shot with very little light, Blu-ray versions are much better (though not perfect). The interviews with the main actors (25 years later) appear in the extra part of the album and a lot of other interesting comments from those who made the film. This is what you want for your collection.'",1
"b""Maybe it was just me, but I did not find this very funny or interesting for that matter ... maybe unlike others I do not find Liz Hurley all this ...

The humorous parts were not so funny ... and I think they could have picked a better loser than Brendan Fraser ... even though I think Liz Hurley I played her part at a T ... I would not recommend this movie unless you like light and chewy humor movies ...""",0
"b'Zen Master Seung Sahn was a teacher of the highest capacity. His every word, movement and action were for everyone\'s benefit. This is something that is usually said by blind and fervent disciples, but I must admit that it seems to have had this effect on everyone he met. I showed this video to my girlfriend (not a Buddhist), and she was hypnotized by her prescription and clarity. And the clarity is what it is.

"b'When this album came out, Spice Girls were everywhere. They were on every cover of a magazine, they were on lollipops, books, they also had several sets of dolls and 5 hit songs. This album has been added and today has sold over 15 million copies worldwide. Admit it, they\'ve sold more records than anyone else from the Beatles and no one has even sold more than the Spice Girls. They are a reference point in pop music, an inheritance and without them, there would be no Britney or Christina.01. Spice Up Your Life (10/10) Yet another # 1 success for girls, this song has some fantastic lyrics. And it was a smart way to market them. I was impressed by the video, it\'s very good. Great song.02. Stop (10/10) The song that has not reached # 1 in the United Kingdom. I love this . The voice of Geri is in my opinion the best part of this song. It sounds so sweet and perfect in its verses. Catchy lyrics ... a perfect pop song. 03. Too Much (10/10) One of my favorite songs from them of all time. Just like 2 Become 1. I love the message and the story behind this. When you have it, it\'s too much ... when you do not, it\'s not enough. GREAT texts.04. Saturday Night Divas (10/10) Another of my favorites. I love the part of Melanie C in the bridge. His voice here amazes me. Even the verses of Emma are perfect. Beautiful song with original and different verses. I love it ! 05. Never Give Up On Good Times (10/10) A lot of fans agree that this would be a great single. This is a great song with a great message for everyone. Especially for girls. Be sure and do not get pregnant ... live young while you can. Move Over (8/10) The song Pepsi, but it is very beautiful on the whole. A sort of filler on this album, but its regular rhythm and raw voice compensate for everything. Although I prefer the other Pepsi song `` Step To Me \'\' on this one. It is available in the Japanese version of this album.07. Do It (9/10) Another song with a great message! My mother did not think so when this album came out, but I agreed with everything they were saying and I still do. `` Rules are meant to be broken, to do what suite, not what they want you to do. \'08. Deny (10/10) Reminds me of my former boyfriend who denied being gay. This is one of my favorites. ""You are not foolin no one but yourself."" So true. ""Viva Forever (10/10) Stupendous! Beautiful lyrics and melody ... Saying goodbye to true love ... I can relate to this deeper than many other songs Here, this song actually gives me the creeps, it\'s an obsessive song, one of their best.10 The Lady Is A Vamp (7/10) It\'s not one of my favorites, but it\'s different, and it\'s a great way to end the album just like a concert ...

He sings impeccably and one of the best Liu I have listened to.3. Turandot ... Eva Marton may not be the best Turandot, but it does not matter. When she and Domingo sang in Act III, it was magic. When he shed tears as I sang my heart throbbed in a renewed passion of why I loved the Opera to begin with. My eyes and ears were glued to my home theater. As far as I'm concerned, Marton and Domingo may have broken their voices and it would not have mattered to me, because the stars were lined up on the Met that night. I have not seen the Metha version of Turandot, but this is the best Turandot I've seen so far.""",1

"b'I have a stubborn girl who has resisted the potty since she was 2 years old. I felt she ""knew"" how to do it, but it was deliberately difficult - some sort of power struggle or something.

"b'The five-star review here must be for the Warner Brothers Archive Collection DVD of ""The Prisoner of Zenda"". \'\' If it were for the Video Grapevine version, I\'m sure it would have mentioned the abysmal quality of the DVD. Grapevine\'s DVD transfer was obtained from an extremely negative print of the film, without any attempt at restoration. Many of the titles are so obscure as to be illegible; surely it would have been easy to create new title cards for this release, unless the Grapevine people could read them either. The contrast in one section of the film is so high that the characters and objects are reduced to blobs without color on the screen. I completely agree with the comments of other reviewers on the acting and the film qualities of the 1922 film. I will return to the Grapvine DVD and am willing to try the Warner Brothers version, but in the meantime I will remain with the 1937 version of Ronald Coleman. .'",0

"b'OK; let\'s clarify something. This is a work of fiction. It is well done, smooth and seductive in its message. But it\'s fiction. However, let\'s also say about some other things. First of all, many of the points made here are true. Which ? Well, I will avoid spoilers but suffice it to say that people often ask me if I am an atheist. No, I say, I do not deny the possibility of a superior being. But I deny the church. This story clearly shows how organized religion has regularly destroyed the best messages, but corrupts them with greed, lust for power and cruelty. Groups of men have made human choices and have written human words to describe a system that would have kept them in power, and this story goes deeper into this. It digs among the little known facts surrounding the so-called ""holy"" Bible ... the idea that what we know today as the Bible differed greatly from what it once was. And so on . I do not try to destroy faith, nor this story. I hope that what it does is convince the viewer / reader to THINK for YOU. This is a fun, well-acted and well-photographed story from a well-written and entertaining work of modern fiction. I hope that if nothing else, create THOUGHTS on the subject, and perhaps, just maybe, people will start to see formal religious institutions like Christianity for what they are ...'",1
"b'I have never written a review before, but after trying this video I felt obliged to warn others how misleading the title of this video is. This video is too intense for anyone with pain in the neck or shoulders. I have a lot of pain in my neck and shoulders and this video only makes it worse. Anyone with severe muscle tension needs yoga with lots of stretching for those tight areas - this video is NOT! The video starts with bending and different loading positions putting a lot of stress on the neck and shoulders (like the dog on the bridge and down). This is a very fast video - it\'s more of a flow of power yoga, definitely not something that ""will save your neck and shoulders""! ! ! ! ! It alternates in and out of load positions very, very fast and there is almost no stretching in this video! She does not explain the poses at all and moves too fast. This video is for advanced power yogies and certainly not for beginners or anyone with some kind of pain. I\'m not a beginner, but I have a lot of pains in my neck and shoulders and this video is completely inappropriate. There are also other reasons why this video is annoying (but these are much less important): the music is annoying (sounds like some sort of voodoo music), the background scenario is nauseating and she is very false. If you\'re looking for a good video to help with neck and shoulder tension, try ""Yoga for stress relief"" with Barbara Benagh, it\'s excellent! This video allows you to choose between different sequences depending on the type of pain you have and you can choose if you want an active stream or a more passive stream.'",0

"b'Every year, when Christmas runs, I like to have friends to enjoy a cup of joy (a powerful recipe of Egg Nog available on request), put some beautiful Christmas music, light a few candles, prepare delicious hour\xc3\xa8 dourves and gather around the my humble but sufficient cinema and watch a wonderful favorite vacation. This year I\'m going to see Die Hard and for me Christmas would not be complete without it. The classic action yarn of John McTiernan (Predator and The Hunt for Red October) that has spawned three explosive sequels never seems to age, no matter how dated their hair, clothes and portraits of California cocaine addicts. Die Hard follows John McClane (Bruce Willis) at his quasi-wife\'s Christmas party (Bonnie Bedelia) in a skyscraper on the west coast. He is a policeman from New York, whose wife and children have moved west while taking a great opportunity and adapting. Evidently, they are having some marital problems but it is understated enough. The building is empty with an exception of the group that is organizing the Christmas party on one of the higher floors. ""Terrorists"" led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) take over the building and chaos ensues. Gruber\'s plan would have worked out perfectly if John had not run away and slowly started pulling out all his servants, while the local authorities were hurling. The feds soon enter and the film explodes into an action classic ... and even a Christmas classic. He has perhaps a nice and convincing hero as you can get in John McClane and Bruce Willis stages every other action hero making John not only clever and fun, but easy to relate to a very small drama. It\'s an effortless performance that I can only compare to Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. Only small, fearless observations coupled with a cynical look on his face make John go from the typical good boy to what every boy dreams of becoming in these circumstances. It\'s fantastic and it\'s kitsch, but it\'s forgivable because it\'s a holiday film and, more importantly, action is still the priority in Die Hard. On the other side of the coin, the greatness of Die Hard is complemented by its formidable and accessible antagonist, Hans Gruber. Even after discovering that Hans is not there as a political terrorist but simply as a thief, he loses absolutely no bad credibility when he responds to Holly McClane\'s criticism by saying, ""I am an outstanding thief, Mrs. McClane, and since I am transferring in rapture, you should be more polite. ""Although we know that Hans is capable of vile acts, he actually sees those as mere means for a greater and somewhat justifiable end. His disposition is almost humanitarian and you could imagine him as a gentleman outside the context of the crimes he commits in Die Hard. In the end, however, Hans is a pure sociopath who even the public is inclined to sympathize with. I wanted him to leave if his opposition was Van Damme, Segal or Stallone ... maybe even Arnold. The supporting cast is another huge force and helps to highlight the humorous undertone of the film. Policemen and feds are all fun and rich characters, in particular Reggie VelJohnson as Sergeant LAPD Al Powell. The bad guys are purely chaotic thugs with enough variety to make them a little more than John\'s. Also worthy of note is the performance of William Atherton\'s reporter, as well as John\'s limousine driver, Argyle. Even editions for television versions are worth being replaced by wonderfully light blasphemies like * a ditch snail *, * melon farmer * e * bad mother cruncher *. Those, of course, make it fun and accessible to all ages and Die Hard is one of the best examples of amused television movies. But of course it\'s not what makes it a great movie. Actually I would say that Die Hard is the biggest action film ever made. Yippie-ki-yay * muddy fundy * ... and happy holidays.'",1
"b'Putting in my two cents: The Girl Who Leapt Through Time is on my list to keep for a while, but I\'ve never had time to check up until yesterday. I (like most of the other reviewers) did not expect too much, but after seeing their new movie ""Summer Wars"" I decided to give it a try. I must say that despite being a slightly older film, this exceeds Summer Wars in almost every aspect (except perhaps computer animation). There are literally no weaknesses in this film. The quality of the animation remains high everywhere. The characters are beautifully hand-drawn and the backgrounds accurately rendered (mostly hand-drawn as well). The use of computer animation is reduced to a minimum and occurs mainly when we see a ""jump"". The characters are strong and friendly. Makoto is the typical awkward teenager. A casual encounter followed by an (almost) terrible accident allowed her to ""jump"" over time. Rather than using this skill for the so-called ""evil"" (I would like to go back and invest heavily in some stocks ...), Makoto uses the ability to make his life and the lives of his best friends. However, this starts to cause unforeseen and terrible circumstances. And this is the point where the film moves from the lighter and somewhat comical to completely dramatic and saddening. I will not divulge any events or ruin any plot for you, but let\'s say I\'ve been touched by the end of the movie (even if I\'m not cross-eyed enough!). The Japanese vocal recitation is strong, especially considering at least 2/3 main characters are voiced by a dub of the first time. Explain how in Japan, they take the voice and behave seriously (rather than most American dubbers who have a core of 5 or 6 full-time actors who MUST match a main character in each series or film - often does not fit to the character). So the story is strong with a little \'science fiction, the characters are nice and well represented, the acting is wonderful, the animation is wonderful ... why have not you seen this yet? If you\'re not an anime fan, this could be a good movie to help you change your mind.'",1
"b""It is simply incomprehensible that someone might think it was a good idea: to take a beloved classic movie and: 1. Cut 15 minutes of footage. Add 15 minutes of badly hit movie footage with terribly bad acting, writing and direction.3. Download the original musical score and replace it with painfully electronic drivel.4. Add insult to injury by deceiving it publicly as the definitive edition of the 30th Anniversary. Words can not express how terrible this edition is. Really, it's so bad. I saw the films of the students and the changes of amateur fans made better. The new movie is written and interpreted in such a serious way that it would be almost fun if it were not cut in this classic film. Stay very, very far from this version.

"b'This is a strangeness: a supernatural low-budget western with a pretty good cast, an eye for winter landscapes and, above all, a truly ghostly atmosphere. Unfortunately, the direction and editing are painful, particularly in the previous Civi War battle scenes, and after the long ascent of Demon Mountain, there is a real sense of anti-climax. The trip is not helped by this version of the Synergy DVD, which is technically laughable, a dubious video recording transferred to digital media with the usual high level of sound and image degradation. To make matters worse are the holes in which the ""bad"" language has been eliminated and, even more damaging, the blood and blood have been surgically removed, which could explain why this version lasts 90 minutes while the original print was 114.'",0

"b'What I liked most about this film is the lack of & quot; message & quot; or agenda. Others then tell a great story that this film had nothing to do ""; demonstrate & quot; . There were no talk about crying for the victims of AIDS, no anguish for the pain of going out, only great characters engaged in a funny and unusual script (with dialouge as good as those of Neal Simon) that works. There are many complicated elements of the plot that come together well and it is not easy to do. The way the writer ties the main characters to the fight to finish his song with the rest of the plot is brilliant. I also differ with the criticism of a previous writer who claimed that the two characters had no chemistry and would never be together in & quot; reality & quot; . You could see it from J.P. Pitoks admirable performance that the character was more than a maniac. Actually I thought they made a really nice and realistic couple, in spite of, but BECAUSE of their differences. The final scene of them walking down the street said everything ... Gabriele could not keep silent and Mark could not speak. But I laughed in the right places. A great movie. The fact that no & quot; message & quot; It is necessary to show that the gay community could start to feel more accepted.'",1
"b""This is the hardest weight training belt I've ever done. Leave the production of an 85-minute killer to Karen Voight. In addition, it gives Karen Voight the opportunity to produce a video full of interesting combinations compiled in such a way as to make the training fly. Karen Voight is the best in her field for a reason. His incredible cueing, his instructions and the same exercises work incredibly well. This video is no exception. Working with the body of the Age, Karen focuses on specific areas, but keeps the whole body moving in the video. Although the background is a bit dated, as well as the flowered bodies, the training is not. My only complaint is that she talks about the music in the background ... the music would be good if it was more than confusing background noise. But the training is so complete and original that this defect can be overlooked. Truly another killer from Karen Voight!""",1

"b'My comments are exclusively about the DVD compared to Blu-ray. I have the extended cut without rating of the DVD version and the PG-13 theatrical cut of the Blu-ray version. My experience was that DVDs burned in high definition look identical to the Blu-ray version (both on a Blu-Ray player and an upconvert DVD player). Ultraviolet is no exception. Moreover, the appearance of the film seems to soften the details, which really defeats the point of view of Blu-ray. Aside from improving the look, the Blu-ray version no longer has any special features on the DVD, and the extended-cut DVD takes another seven minutes. Go with the DVD version on this.'",0

This episode was really broadcast exclusively 3 weeks before the start of the fourth season. It's a pity, it should have been included in this box for a complete set.

"b""The classic story of all times of demonic possession, based on the bestselling novel by William Peter Blatty. Linda Blair is Regan MacNeil, a twelve-year-old girl who manifests herself with a truly malevolent spirit. His mother, Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), an agnostic, seeks help from a young Jesuit psychiatrist, Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller, God rests his Irish soul!) Who has his demons and is tormented by the recent death of his mother , and his loss in faith in which he sought refuge. After confronting the demon within the girl (and himself), Karras, despite being skeptical about demonic possession, receives permission from the church to assist during the exorcism. The priest chosen to perform the ritual is a mysterious, elderly Jesuit, father Lankaster Merrin (Max Von Sydow) who has already seen such diabolical works. While the two clergymen clash against the demon, a police detective, Lieutenant William F. Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb) finds some links linking the girl to a mysterious death and desecration in the local Catholic church. William Friedkin directed brilliantly, and Blatty adapted the screenplay (receiving an Oscar for his efforts) and produced. The cast offers extraordinary and sensitive interpretations (Burstyn, Miller and Blair have been nominated for the Academy Awards) and the special effects are breathtaking and still punch, with veteran Mercedes McCambridge providing the voice of the evil entity. (The film also won for Best Achievement In Sound). The underlying theme of much of Blatty's work is obvious, being his philosophy, if there is all this evil out there, why is there so much good? Metaphorically, everyone fights his own demons, and even in his last sacrificial moment, Karras rediscovers his faith and heroically gives his life to save this innocent child. How much can be more significant? A truly terrifying film, compelling and ultimately touching with faith and human frailty.""",1

b'GREAT FILM. THE HISTORY LINE WAS PLAUSIBLE AND THE MUSIC WAS REALLY BIG. THIS IS ONE TO LOOK AND ABOVE',1
"b""This story immediately caught my attention and held it back for the entire movie. The film is based on the life of John Nash. He was a brilliant mathematician who became famous as a young man for his work in economics. The film lasts several decades and begins when John Nash arrives at Princeton University. Russell Crowe does an excellent job in the role of Nash. The part called for the transformation of Nash from a young and healthy man to an elderly schizophrenic. Alicia, Nash's wife is played by Jennifer Connelly. She is very convincing as an intelligent and strong woman who comes to realize that her brilliant husband is very upset and lives in another world. A particular and beautiful scene stands out in my mind where Nash and his future wife are looking at the stars. He tells her to think of different shapes or animals and he is able to look at the night sky, with its millions of stars, and link them together in any form. I wish there were more scenes of that kind and maybe some insight into Nash's family and childhood. John Nash was eventually awarded the Nobel Prize for mathematics, which is a bit of a consolation, but the tragedy of his mind endowed with being attacked by the disappointments was something I will not forget. I came out of this film with an enormous amount of compassion for John Nash. Schizophrenia is really a horrible mental illness. This film deserves to be seen and I believe it will stand the test of time.""",1

"b'I felt compelled to write a review of this film for several reasons. First of all because this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I will never get tired of watching this film over and over and sharing with others who have not yet had the pleasure of watching it. I also wanted to write this review because many young film fans immediately reject old films and especially black and white films. And finally, I wanted to put my two cents after reading the review of the ""professional critic"" ... mis-cast? ? ? Why could there be a more perfect and better cast? ? ? Gregory Peck, whom I had come to worship like Atticus Finch in ""Killing a mocking bird"" (he\'s the reason why I wanted to be a lawyer when I was a kid), and Audrey Hepburn has the perfect mix of innocence and courage for her role of rebel princess. Eddie Albert as the comic free kick was also ideal. This film follows a princess who, at first sight, lives an enviable life of wealth, fame and charm. I have always found it difficult to find compassion for the complaints of similar people in both real life and in movies, but somehow Audrey Hepburn takes it out and is not hard to cheer for her while she experiences such fundamental things as deciding how her hair they should be cut and eating an ice cream. While Gregory Peck is undeniably agile as the rogue American journalist, he is also able to pull off the necessary mawkishness to make his role credible. You must be able to understand that its initial motivation does NOT come from a ""good place"", but simply from greed and selfishness .... but then you must also believe its change of heart and its subtlety. And it works. He does not wake up suddenly and changes his mind. You can see its transformation, or its relevance, throughout the film. As a romantic wardrobe I have to say that I always secretly hope that there will be a better ending (and for ""better"" I do not mean in terms of film quality, I mean in terms of a classic ""happy ending""). . The final scene is excruciating, yet the only plausible way it could end. I\'m still wondering what the hell happened after, despite knowing the answer perfectly ... and it\'s not necessarily what we all love to imagine. But I respect the fact that the film does not syllable and does not envelop it in a delicious bow. Again a tearful ending, but exactly how it should be. Please see this movie. You\'ll want to own it after I promise it. And do not be fooled, it\'s not just an old, old-fashioned ""chick"" movie. \'\' It\'s just good. Oh yes, and this * sighing factor * ... HUGE! Have fun and share with a younger audience, so this classic will never be lost in modern blockbusters.'",1

"b'I have to agree with the reviewers who say the production of this footage is very poor. If you are looking to see Evanescence live in concert, chances are you will not find it here. This looks more like any music video than a concert. It has been modified to the nth degree and rarely focuses on a shot for more than two seconds. Fortunately, the DVD has some positive factors, including the emotionally suffering music videos of ""Bring Me to Life"", ""Going Under"", ""My Immortal"" and ""Fool of All"". The behind the scenes bits are slightly entertaining, if nothing else. It\'s nice to show that this band has a lot of fun on the road, giving the impression that they will not leave soon. If the video aspect of the DVD is badly done, the audio is much better, which is why, if it were possible, I suggest you buy the concert CD instead of the DVD. However, Amy\'s voice is familiar in concert, which I was not sure about; do you know how some singers play in a completely different way from a live recording? Well, she does not. Her voice falters during some of the fast-paced songs, but that\'s to be expected when she runs and jumps onto the stage. I was particularly impressed by the ballads; his powerful voice combined with his beautiful piano playing was chilling, especially during ""Breathe No More"" and the band\'s success, ""My Immortal"". I was surprised to discover that I really liked ""Thoughtless"", the band\'s cover of a KoRn song. I\'ve never been a KoRn, or an alternative to rock-heavy-metal, but I was impressed by the way this song was performed by Evanescence. The audio CD also includes an unpublished track called `` Missing """". Just like the other ballads of the band, this song is sweet, soft, has a good voice and painful but beautiful lyrics. In conclusion, Evanescence plays very, very well on this CD. It is a real pleasure to listen; it\'s just the DVD that, well, sucks.'",1

The tagline of how far you would go to protect your own flesh and blood promises much more than it offers. In fact, it never manages to increase the tension, even in the scenes that for rights should be the most interesting of the film, as the revelation of what really happened between Furlong and his girlfriend. All performances are intact and correct; this is exactly the kind of role that best suits Streep (although it was much more fun in ""The River Wild""), Neeson is also very good in a unfortunately stereotypical role and although Furlong is often typist like the teenager problematic It sounds better than any other. However, the main flaw is that something that promises an emotion never really reaches the boiling point and despite the names of the stars you can not help but think that everything looks very much like a movie for TV.

"b'& quot; Return of the Living Dead "" is a funny horror / comedy inspired by the classic of George A. Romero & quot; Living Dead & quot; movie . I saw this movie when I was just a small child and I loved it. This is like the film of the 80s of Camp horror. The film premis are a nice tribute to Romero. Apparently, the film & quot; The night of the living dead & quot; it was based on a true story, and was covered by the United States government. The bodies of the zombies were sealed in oil drums and dispersed. Two workers in a medical supply store find one of these drums, drill an accident and release a gas that brings the dead neighbor back to life. Fortunately, the warehouse is right next to a cemetery. The rest is written by itself, and the film has some of the funniest moments in the history of the horror film: a corpse that goes crazy in the warehouse, a zombie head that is hit outside the park with a baseball bat, a zombie that orders & quot; more paramedics & quot; as if he were ordering pizza. And above all, a 80s hard rock soundtrack. This is one of my favorite party movies, because it brings everyone (even non-horror fans) to howl. It is sometimes bloody, but the comedy obscures the elements of horror. The DVD in question is a bit light on extras, except for a fun but warm documentary. But the big advantage is the best audio and video quality I\'ve ever seen in this movie. The DVD really makes the difference. Take a copy and see what I mean, you will not regret it.'",1

"b""Because this film is out of print, it took me a couple of weeks to find a copy. However, once I did, I felt I had found the holy grail of the horror film. The story revolves around a scandalous relationship made by a bored housewife (Julia Cotton) and her brother-in-law (Frank Cotton). Julia and her husband move into Frank's old house after Frank's sudden death. Of course, Frank has not really disappeared. Instead, the brother-in-law pervert found a cube-shaped puzzle. Once opened, the puzzle unlocks a portal for the world of Cenobites. The Cenobites offer maximum pleasure, but at a high cost. Able to escape the world of the Cenobites when a drop of his brother's blood was spilled on the floor of the house, Frank returns like a walking corpse, which needs parts of the body from living beings to be completed again. Frank uses his past relationship with Julia to convince her to bring him new victims. With each victim, Frank becomes more complete, but also more impatient. There are several scenes of prefiguration, praying mantis and evil devil with Julia as she goes out into the bars and picks up random men for the massacre. Of course, in the end her actions arouse suspicions in her grown stepdaughter and her husband ... The film introduces the introduction of the Cenobites, which are some of the most ghostly cats in horror from the Xenomorphs of Alien. As the film progresses, we learn more about these beings, their origins and their purpose. Naturally, the ending leaves everything open, which leads to the various sequels. I highly recommend this film to those who like to watch the first horror films made by those who are now considered masters of the genre.""",1
"b""For the big fans of Manhunter, I would advise you to avoid this DVD if you plan to own ... What was announced as & quot; Theatrical & quot; the version is actually an unrelated version that awkwardly modifies two scenes that were released in theaters, including one of the key scenes, and yet has some of the most mundane footage restored from the cutting room floor. These cuts are bad and do not make sense to them, since they do not represent the theatrical output and destroy the momentum of what had been a finely-edited film. I do not know if it was ignorance or arrogance, but this is the worst hacking job I've ever seen trying to pass by product. Whoever was in charge of this in Anchor Bay was an idiot and if I were Michael Mann, I would call my lawyers. The & quot; Director's Cut & quot; it's even worse as it includes the & quot; Not theatrical & quot; release And the so-called & quot; Director's Cut & quot; - a collection of some interesting and not so interesting pieces. As a companion to a real theatrical output, this would have been a fascinating addition; But here again, Anchor Bay finds a way to ruin what should be a good product. The entire film that was not put into post-production video is stained and blurred, as if it had been transferred from a VHS tape - and one worn. - Simply amazing that anyone can have the audacity to offer this kind of cheapness for hard earned money. I saw this film when it first came out in the theater and I considered it one of the best of that year; and I rushed to buy the LaserDisc version when it came out. When the Director's Cut DVD was released this year by Anchor Bay, I was on the waiting list, ready to welcome the improved version of the THX widescreen. Being intimately aware of the film, imagine my disappointment. Do not waste time. Wait until a better version comes out. To make these people want to compare Silence of the Lambs with Manhunter, they usually prefer one another and their minds are practically invented at this point. I'm exactly in the field of Manhunter. As far as I'm concerned, I liked Silence, but I could never take it seriously since I found Lector's line both incredibly superhuman and therefore unrealistic and unsuspecting. However, the Reader of Manhunter is a chilling but more realistic picture that amazes me every time I see it in the way that an evil genius manages to manipulate events outside his cell through the simple device of a telephone. This Lector is safe behind the sterilized bars - yet it still manages to be a forced presence to deal with. I hope every fan and future fan of Manhunter can see it the way it came out, a beautiful piece of crafts that was thin and marginal, yet elegantly flowing. Siskel and Ebert rated him one of the best films of all time, years after he came out. But for now, I will keep my LaserDisc.""",0
"b""I saw and loved all three of these films, so I did not scroll down to read the reviews. I should have . The first film was great, the second film was fantastic, the third film was packaged D3, the album was labeled as D3, but the film was ... ..Monkeys Go Home. Sent for a replacement and the third film was again `` Monkeys Go Home ''. So the monkeys come back.""",0
"b'All three films are pleasant sitting on the edge of your exciting seat, but most people already know the lines of the story. The first of the three films, The Bourne Identity, has both excellent video and very discrete audio channel monitoring. The sound mixers did a great job using all the surround channels and did not allow the soundtrack to hide the various effects of a foley in any of the front or back channels. Of course, with all the excitement, your subwoofer will have a good workout. Video transfer is good enough without video noise, aliasing or artifacts. This movie started the entire franchise and was a super start. My only question was how Bourne, shot in the back, brought out his amnesia. It was never a true answer because amnesia would generally be derived from a severe head injury and not from 2 bullets in the back. The Bourne Supremacy, the second film in the trilogy, made much greater use of the handheld camera, and while it did not bother me, I remember a friend and a professional photographer, who made me suffer from seasickness. The video transfer on Blu-ray was excellent in all respects, but I also noticed a less directional use of the audio. Rather than put the money in a more discrete sound editing, the producers have enhanced the soundtrack that has virtually wrapped the entire soundstage, front and back. It is not that the soundtrack does not fit the film, it certainly does, and creates the excitement atmosphere required by the film Bourne, but more attention to the 5.1 stage for melodic effects would have been nice. The latest in the trilogy, the Bourne Ultimatum, completes the package with the same force in the video transfer. I have not seen any weak points in any of the video transfers for the 3 films, but again, in the Bourne Ultimatum, you would think that with all the excitement going on, the use of the front and surround back sides would be more prominent. I was disappointed that, like the Bourne Supremacy, they simply raised the sound levels of the soundtrack that would have overshadowed every melodic effect. I am not saying that there is no use of discrepancies in any of the last two films, but not where it is as it might have been or how it was used in the first Bourne Identity. To save $ increase the soundtrack level and this is a pity. During the battle scene there are things that are thrown, breaking glass and all sorts of chaos that could easily have been driven left or right, front or back. So, at that point, I was disappointed. Nonetheless, this is a great collection to have and the excitement and rhythm of the 3 films is simply excellent. There are a lot of deleted scenes and other ""making of"" short films and comments without wasted space for previews and advertisements for other films. It\'s worth it. Hopefully, this review was helpful and if so, please check the \'Helpful\' button so I know you are on the correct path with my reviews for you. Thank you .'",1
"b'From time to time comes a film that has almost no publicity or even a decent publication for the general public, alas the purgatory of limited films and arthouse films. Yet, in the case of Equilibrium, I am more surprised by the reason why this has never received a larger version. After seeing the film, I honestly did not have high expectations, except to see some fantastic shootings and martial arts as the protagonist of the film. While this factor has proven to be fun, the real star belongs to the finely crafted script that pays homage to novels such as ""Brave New World"", ""1984"" and ""Fahrenheit 451"". History places the viewer in the post-apocalyptic world of the future. After suffering the consequences of World War III, the survivors banned to form a new society that would free them from the biggest imperfections, from the emotions. Controlled by a drug that cancels these senses, the future is a war-free utopia, but enslaved to those who hold power and the created establishment. Art, music, literature, all these are forbidden and the penalty for committing such sensory crimes is death. The most feared of the protectors of power is the cleric. A group of men trained in the mind and body to be the perfect machines to kill and the children of their ideals. One of these Clerics, who even executed his partner for reading a book of poetry, begins to see the world in a new light when he misses the normal dose and experiences a flow of emotions that he had never felt before. While trying to keep his duty, he finds the cruel sadism of his assigned task almost more than he can bear. In a desperate search he tries to find the resistance and put an end to the madness that he has safeguarded. Christian Bale, interpreting the Cleric, is incredible giving depth and emotion to a role that did not require it. This makes the film even deeper. Film style and editing, borrowed from directors such as John Woo and Tsui Hark, bring enough freshness to adapt these styles. The artistic direction is suitable for creating a claustrophobic world of dark lies. Although the backdrops of the city are not as impressive and are obviously CG effects. The music that is sometimes dark and intertwined with the presentiment of a conflict, is therefore a fast techno rhythm that marks the pace for the gun fire without losing a beat. In all the Equilibriums, Science Fiction fans become reality, but it is also a film that can also be appreciated by fans of classical literature. While the ending may seem too simplified, I actually found a deeper meaning and an interesting commentary on humanity in general. But most will simply be enthusiastic at the end of a ten-minute gunfight, with an impressive sword duel. The balance contains strong violence and language and is recommended for ages 17 and up. For once, style and substance collide on celluloid.'",1
"b""I can not do more on this DVD! ! ! ! I think they did the best they could with the incorporation of music with phonics. I swear, my 6-year-old first-grader has had a noticeable improvement in reading and spelling after watching this video. At the beginning of the school year, he had an average of 3 out of 8 in his spelling and in his first report card, the teacher said he needed more reading assistance. I turned on this video a couple of times during the week for a few weeks for her to watch and every time I started it in a different chapter. There was a marked improvement in reading and spelling. Now he got an 8/8 for his spelling. He started coming home with stickers every day from school, saying he did a good job reading. He said this phonetic video taught her to read! ! ! Just a few weeks ago, we were hardly going through Dora's series of phonetics and now he is reading books he has taken from the library and who are on the second level. Fantastic video! ! ! ! I think all Kindergarten and First grade teachers should use this video to integrate the teaching there. Students refer to this much better than a teacher who is trying to teach it.""",1

"b""It was fun to read these posts of people who have been so touched and amused by this film. I saw it when it came out for the first time and since then I've had Cat Stevens' songs in mind.

"b""This is one of the most beloved films by the affictionados of the foreign film scene. Tati provided a brilliant connection between the best of what the era of silent cinema and modern film had to offer. It is a relatively simple story of a man stumbling on vacation on the coast of France. But repeated views, especially over the years, open up more and more treasures that until then had not been recognized, like a classic novel. I would be surprised if anyone dared to talk about this film the first time they watch it. I certainly do not. But the views repeated over the years will give you an appreciation of this film that borders on the cult. Every member of my extended family loves this film, and everyone has a special reason. Some love him for his ability to capture a foreign time and place perfectly, letting them feel like they've escaped to the French coast for the afternoon. Some love Hulot's clumsy but endearing attempts for romance. Many love bright-looking gags that laugh out loud, no matter how many times you've seen them. But regardless of what a spectator loves the most, everyone will feel a connection with the character of Hulot (and, in turn, M. Tati) that will last a lifetime. With this DVD, I can finally feel sure to lend my beloved, grainy VHS copy. A classic of the cinema with every meaning of the term.""",1
"b""When I was ten, my mother's uncle gave me his copy of the book A Bridge Too Far by Cornelius Ryan. This was a very special gift from him, since he was deported to Germany to work for the Reich during the Second World War and he never mentally recovered from what had happened to him. At the time I got the book, he lived in a small village, a few miles west of Arnhem, on the south bank of the Rijn River. Of course, I was young to read the book at the time. Over the years my interest in World War II and the Market Garden operation began to grow, and every time a Too Far bridge was broadcast, I watched it. The scenes that describe the drops of the paratroopers and the onslaught of the Waal river were the most remembered. That, and the great soundtrack of John Addison. Finally I bought the DVD, and I watched it a few times since then. I have to say that every time I watch it, the film always gets better. Above all with captions: first those that specify where we are. Without these, one could get confused at the point where the viewer was taken from one scene to another. Secondly, because English is not my mother tongue, I've got to understand some of the dialogues better. (I finally understood what Liv was trying to say in Dutch =) The widescreen option is fantastic. Get into the battle scenes and see all the extra images ... for example when John Frost's batalion is entering Arnhem, you see people riding a bike in the background, you can not see in the pan and scan version. But with an excellent medium like DVD, and even with the film 25th anniversary of last year, MGM and United Artists missed a big chance. It is a pity that the only extra is the original theatrical trailer. I would have liked to see other material behind the scene included in a second album. The Dutch Broadcasting Company (NOS) must have a lot of movies, I remember that the news transmitted often spent time during the filming of the film, like the re-interpreted droppings. In addition to this video, the studio must also have extra footage. They could even produce a new documentary on the filming of this film, including interviews with key actors and Sir Richard Attenborough. And what about the shooting and the original notes on the battle that took place? Despite this lack, it is still a must buy if you are in war and / or classic movies. After 25 years it is still in the hands, and it is still a shiver to watch. Buy it, and in the meantime continue to hope for a special edition on DVD. I give this DVD 4 stars, but if they had included the extra material, they would easily get 5 stars!""",1
"b'This movie has always been one of my favorites. I own three copies on VHS (two back-ups only in what I usually go out). I make all my friends look at him, and most of them love him as much as I do. It\'s stupid, completely inept and totally hilarious. I put it there with `` Forbidden Zone \'\' by Richard Elfman and `` Crimewave \'\' by John Paiz (AKA `` The Big Crimewave \'\') as one of the three cult films of all time. Only the problem is that nobody has ever heard of this film. So I could not believe my luck when I stumbled on the DVD! ! ! I thought I was dreaming. I was tempted to buy three copies ... just in case. First of all, I looked at the deleted scenes and extras, which were really great. It seemed strange, though, because I had already seen many of the deleted scenes (they are part of my VHS versions). Then, when I settled down to watch the movie, my heart broke. Someone, in their infinite wisdom, decided to tocensurate almost all the nakedness, and many others were shortened, or completely missing. I suppose this version of the film might seem a bit more temperate, because the missing scenes may have slowed the pace of the film a little, but the muted scenes were all priceless. The ineptitude of this film is what made it special, and its modification in a version of ""professional sentiment"" is a borderline blasphemy. After seeing this modified and censored version, I wished I had never bought it. I wish it did not even exist. Thank God for my VHS copies. Anyone who has decided to censor and modify this film should be a beast with himself. Thank you so much for destroying one of my favorite movies. I only give him two stars because the extras are fantastic.'",0

"b'I\'m just writing this review, so this movie does not have the three stars sad and wrong by the only other reviewer. There are a handful of really great Vietnam war movies, and they generally cover their own land. Full Metal Jacket is an exception as it covers the other three doing separately. Platoon covers real combat, the feeling of hell that has produced in an individual experiencing the fight, the jungle, the trauma at the time the trauma is happening . The deer hunter covers the post-war trauma, the long-term effect on the psyche of a veteran. Apocalypse covers the psychological (and poetic) heart of war, ie the core of what war means, which is hate, the fear and the ruthless nature of the universe. After all, it is based on ""Heart of Darkness"". ""It could, on the whole, be the most terrifying and compelling of them all."" In turn, Heart of Darkness and this film are based on a long series of literary backgrounds called ""katabasis"" in Greek, that is, descent into the underworld. epic, punctuated by scenes after scene that become dark and twisted, and the protagonist is self-forced, going to hell without knowing why - because how evil exists, he feels attracted to it, to try to understand it, or if not It can become part of it.Three transient, it asks you to try to understand the evil.If you did not already, I would definitely buy it for 6 dollars, as anyone should see this page and did not see the movie.'",1
"b""I never had the chance to go and see this movie when it appeared in the cinemas. I rented it without knowing what to expect. After seeing it on DVD, I can say that I would not mind paying the price of the cinema ticket to watch this movie. It's not all that fascinating, but what it is is a good, respectable good movie. Gabrielle Union does a good job interpreting a rude, hateful sister who hates men with the name of Eva. Sometimes she takes it to the top, but that's acting and that's what's paid to do. Eva is determined to take care of her little sister who turns to her for advice rather than for her men. The sister loves Eva and listens to her as if her word were the Gospel. Men, on the other hand, hate his courage and want nothing more than to see her leave the city. He often interferes with his sisters 'relationships and makes sure to drive his sisters' men crazy. So, in order to bring the right order to their respected relationships, men plotting to bring Eve out of their lives. So the need for Ray (LL Cool J). Ray is a playa that speaks smoothly with a serious game. The men talk to Ray to go out with Eva to get her out of their lives. Ray agrees and so the story begins with two people falling in love with each other and should not fall in love. That's how things get complicated for Ray and Eve. Some parts of the film were a little outrageous and the ending was not the best, but all in all it was still a pretty good movie. I have read some reviews on this film and on other films. My thing is that if you want real life situations, go watch a drama or a real life story. This is comedy ... comedy should not be real. It really is an escape from reality. We do not all need this right now? However, in addition to the final, this film has been well done with support actors who do a good job interpreting their respected roles. Also, the women in this movie are pretty good. Furthermore, LL did a good job interpreting Ray. I have a lot of respect for him as an actor. He did not play his part, but made him credible. All in all, I give this film a B +. The finish was a bit cliche.""",1

The clang of swords. The Eagles screeching. The sound of Sting slicing spiders. The sound of Glamdring shooting down Goblin. Many others . All finished . They even cut parts of dialogue. At one point, Bilbo seems to be just talking to himself because the camera's dialog has disappeared. The film has been made dead and emotionless. I hope they will correct this with a future version.

"b""This inept film does not make any sense at all. A sort of JURASSIC PARK with the millionaire joking with genetics and comes with three ugly sabretooth tigers. The script calls them huge but they do not seem very big for me and the CGI effects are much lower than normal. Even the cast is rather ineffective, with Robert Carradine making an impression of Jack Nicholson, Nicholas Bell who is properly British and boring and Stacy Haiduk who tries to exude sexuality but does not realize it. The subplot involves, what else, a group of mindless university students who choose this resort site as a scavenger hunt for new commitments. There's no suspense, but there's a bizarre ending in store for Mr. Bell that's pretty innovative. No real bite in this, though.""",0
"b""This is a little known but absolutely marvelous film that, although it seems banal, deserves to be shared by many. A small film about a family and the small trials and daily tribulations that they go through. It is very realistic and takes care of the most common things in everyday life. What makes this film so extraordinary is how it is able to present this window in the life of this group of people with such intelligence, intolerance, sadness and honesty; at the end resulting in a film that is tender and edifying and full of hope. Acting is simply fantastic. There are no other words to say it. Everyone, from Brenda Blethyn to Timothy Spall, from Marianna Jean Baptiste to Claire Rushbrook, all take turns stealing scenes in such natural shows and sometimes they do not even hear them reciting. This is a real acting that goes straight to the heart. The script is wonderful as it provides so many little details that you would not think of including in a movie. Only the smallest things that somehow bring the characters to life. A wonderful film that will never get any applause because all of this concerns the actors. There are no special effects or sex scenes with halle berries. Nothing to do - this is an actor's movie. And they steal the show. If you have taste in REAL cinema, do not miss this gem of a movie. IT IS SIMPLE WONDERFUL.""",1
"b'As other reviewers have said, I could not wait to see a genuine adaptation of H.G. The classic novel by Wells. At the same time, I was aware that this film was made on a modest budget, with the expected results. Well, this movie was worse than I expected. The special effects seemed rather comic, especially compared to the state of the art (Spielberg). Worse, the use of color filters in many scenes has become extremely annoying after a while. Even the overall quality of the print was mediocre, with oversized colors and just sharpness. And the acting will not get any Oscar nomination. Also, I wonder if the original 3 hour version would be better to look at the story. In this 125 minute version, in my opinion, there is a lot of jumps from one subplot to another without adequate scene development. Martian\'s ""red herb"" appears briefly in some scenes without any explanation. On the plus side, I thought the tripods and the manipulation machines were pretty interesting, the sound effects are pretty good and the soundtrack is nice. Unfortunately, this is not enough to overcome the otherwise poorly executed production. If only the CGI were in the vanguard and the colored filters were eliminated, it would be a good but not exceptional film. If only ... ..'",0

"b""G.D is really almost perfect. I never get tired. At the same time I think most people do not understand the point. (By the way, I have NOT seen the Special Edition.) I faced each time watching the totally egocentric Bill Murray caught in this wonderful temporal paradox, living the same day over and over again. He goes through different stages: fear and confusion; euphoria, when he realizes that he can do NOTHING without consequences; despair, when he realizes that life does not make sense if you pursue selfish pleasures without goals; and finally a peaceful self-realization when he dedicates himself to the personal improvement and humanitarian goals that his situation offers him the opportunity to pursue. He pauses to consider what each of the United States would do in a similar circumstance. Oh, it's really funny, as well.""",1

Tara Reid can not act! ! Either that or the director and / or the script were so lame that it made her look bad. 4) I think that what was top for me was this attractive woman with her baseball hat backwards (what happened to it? !) and the trick all done and she is the communications specialist for some secret government agency (no dress code?). She keeps looking pretty and tries to sound tough as she pushes the buttons and gives Stephen Dorff updates when she can see for herself what's going on. Really stupid! ! 5) The director can not create a suspensive scene for his life. They were based too much on special effects and less on finding a better director. Overall: not even worth renting. Even if you're a fan of Slater / Reid / Dorff, do not do it! !""",0
"b'Damn, is she playing twins again? We did not need a remake of The Parent Trap, and we need it even less. I did not care if the guy tortured one - or both, if any, of the girls because Lohan is so burned at this point that it\'s sickening. Apart from his personal image, out of the camera, it was very bad in this film, but the film was also a bit boring. What were they smoking to put this debacle in the cinemas? Hmm, it looks like a bad trip ... Lohan has that shrill and crazy voice that makes you nervous, just like cousin Miley Cyrus, and arrives on your last nerve very quickly, just like a wooden knob. You have no idea what\'s going on at first, and then you play even worse than the most horrible offer that Lifetime has given us over the years. The horrible casting and the bad dialogue are all driven by a stupid title that does not sound true. Too bad not having driven straight on a cliff. Let\'s add the fact that we have the irritating Julia Ormond ""playing"" a mother who happens to have her daughter go upstairs with a boyfriend and pretend to loudly rumble. Oh yeah ? I do not care who you think you are; Amnesia - or whatever it is - would not be enough for me to allow my children to indulge in carnal pleasures under my roof. You do not like any of these characters and you do not mind them. This is the key to a great movie in ANY genre - feeling compassion, or at least empathy - for at least two people in a movie. There\'s none of this here, and we\'re treated with tons of bloody scenes that can not even produce the desired effect. When you get down, the best IKWKM actors are the blue rose petals. In short, two hours have been dismembered from my life that I will never return.'",0
"b'This film is in English with its main star being an American. However it is a Japanese collaborative effort. Essentially a Japanese horror film, it has some things in common with ""The Grudge"". \'\' Once again, we have an obsessive oozing shivering face covered with hanging hair. I\'m not sure why hiding an apparition behind the strands of hair is such an unsettling effect - but it is. Furthermore, the premise of driving along a lonely road at night is strange in and of itself. And when you have a body in the trunk of your car - the journey becomes doubly full of dangers. Acting is generally made of wood. The actress who plays one of the main interests of love is the Japanese with a very limited and pungent command of the English language. With so many actors eager to appear in the movies, I do not know why they can not find a better talent. So, this film is not very memorable. But it is not a complete waste of time. It will make you think twice the next time you load a corpse in your car and go to the nearest lake to get rid of it. You will realize that you could only be for some night terrors along the way.'",0

After a long ""comic declaration of non-responsibility"" at the beginning of the film, the ""plot"" tries essentially to parody many classics, Hollywood, political and religious and to inject as many disturbing images of sexually mutilated Barbi dolls as possible. The ""action"" is provided by a variety of ""action figure"" toys that are manipulated (clunkily) by hand and through the overlays of the green screen. A ""bit of this"" is fun, but in the end the concept runs out and the macabre pre-occupation of Zebub with the vile images of S & M perpetuated on female dolls becomes quite disturbing. However, there is some intelligence in the basic concept that makes this satirical flik more engaging than many of Zebub\'s seemingly more ""serious"" efforts. I would recommend buying only this (if at all) at a discounted (used) minimum price as the content probably would not hold up to multiple views.'",0

"b'Ah, Gargoyles, finally get a well-deserved release of DVD. This series is really excellent and has the honor of being one of Disney\'s most mature animated series to date. The series revolves around a group of living gargoyles, which are stones during the day and meat at night. Because of a curse on them, a small group of these creatures is frozen in stone for a thousand years before being awakened in Manhattan in 1994. Like all supernatural beings in Manhattan, they naturally decide to fight crime. It may seem trivial, but in the hands of a wonderful team of writers the series becomes much more than another story of ""non-human superheroes fight crime"". Instead, Gargoyles becomes an interesting story with a gripping storyline and good characters. This series is helped by his ability to risk: the first episode ends up with what is essentially a mass murder. The show also deals with issues such as the control of firearms in ways that are fairly mature and realistic while being neither overly moralistic nor preachers. For example, the episode of control of the gun ""Deadly Force"" (shamefully omitted by Toon Disney in his run of the series due to the presence of guns and shootings, despite his strong message * against * the inexperience in playing with such weapons and fortunately restoring the DVD release) transmits his message without the characters standing up saying ""The guns are bad, mm\'kay?"" The series also has a continuity of continuity rarely seen in American cartoons; previous episodes have effect on subsequent episodes and the episodes have a fairly precise order - unlike some of the other Disney toons of the time, the episodes of Gargoyles generally had to be broadcast in the right order to make sense. also rich in references to Shakespeare (as well as other things: the first episode of the second season contains, among all things, a joke about Kafka that I did not have for * years *). goys are really one of the most interesting and unique cartoons series in the Disney vault. This DVD is a great buy for fans of long standing and highly recommended for new people curious to know what it is. The first season wonderfully defines the rest of the series and gives the viewer an idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bwhat this series is in general. I\'m already looking forward to future versions of the rest of the series.'",1

"b'This film was not meant to be taken seriously .... I think what they tried to do here is relive the experience of action films of the 80s. If you watch this film, you are falsely leading to believe that you can be blown up and survive, take a fire extinguisher in your face and go right back, and it can be fired hundreds of times and not hit. The dialouge is silly, however, the acting is pretty good. Sit down and enjoy / laugh.'",0
"b'If anyone doubts the temporal quality of fame, think of Douglas Fairbanks to bring the point home. In his day, the fame of Douglas Fairbanks was unprecedented. He and his wife, Mary Pickford, were considered the American royal family. Today his marvelous action films are not watched by cinema fans, and his face and his name are lost to the younger generation (if Jay Leno\'s interviews for ""man on the street"" are indicative, the our young Americans seem proud of no to know the name of the Vice President, much less a silent screen actor like Fairbanks). What Douglas Fairbanks should fade from memory is tremendously sad. ""Zorro\'s brand"" is a good example of the kind of film that Fairbanks specialized at the end of the silent era, and was extremely popular with the dynamic presence of its star. There was really nothing to compare to Fairbanks from his departure from the movies. No action stars can approach his grace and power in an action movie. If you doubt me, buy this DVD and see for yourself. Watch Fairbanks jumping on the tables, climb over the walls of the chest to mount a horse, jump from a table to a frame near a ceiling, etc. And it was not just what he was able to do these things, it was that he made them effortlessly. The pure grace of man was truly electrifying. He never seemed to strive for anything. I noticed it as I watched the Mark of Zorro during a scene in which Fairbanks swung his leg and ran off his horse, running in a gallop, to land with his feet as if he were coming down the ladder. It made it look so easy, I came back and looked at the scene again to make sure I saw what I thought I saw. Yes, he had done it - as smooth as silk. Then there is his acting. In this film, Fairbanks plays a dueling role: Don Diego, a young crazy nobleman, and his masked counterpart, Zorro. His interpretation of Don Diego is subtle and effective. His body looks shapeless and soft. His ways are distracted, undecided and vaguely lost. He hates the sword and constantly dries his face because of his great fatigue. \'\' When his love interest states `` He is not a man - he is a fish! \'\' she hits the nail on the head. Yet when he wears the mask, his body and his ways are reborn. His body appears supple and full of movement, and his smile, that tremendous radiant smile that radiates pure happiness, is almost as devastating as his blade. Finally, there is the artistic design and the sets of this film. Fairbanks loved these vintage pieces and spared no expense for research and details. His care, financial investments and dedication to craftsmanship really prove this. Everything has a beautiful and ""deep"" feeling. As a side note, this review is based on Kino\'s DVD release of this film, and as with all versions of Kino, this edition looks simply fantastic. God Bless Kino to be one of the best companies that preserves and markets silent films. If you took the trouble to read this review, please buy this movie. If you do, Douglas Fairbanks will be popular again and again, at least in your heart. - Mykal Banta'",1

"b'The multi-film packages of MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT are quite cheap and of good quality. These twenty unrestored public domain movie transfers vary from very good to sometimes fair - no one is ever unwatchable. The ""legendary detectives"" in this DVD package are all series of derivative films of the \'30s and\' 40s. ""The Shadow"" was a half-hour radio show broadcast for the first time on 7/31/30. Originally only the narrator of mysterious stories, in 1937 ""The Shadow"" Lamont Cranston (now played by a young Orson Welles) had become an integral character in each episode broadcast. The 24-year run of the program ended the day after Christmas, 1954. The three Shadow movies were first seen here in 1937, at the height of the popularity of the radio program. ""Bulldog Drummond"" was created in 1920 by British author Herman McNeile, who published under the pseudonym ""Sapper"". ""Drummond\'s stories were directly influenced by"" noir ""investigators who were then popular in American fiction and are considered the precursors of James Bond. The half dozen films in this set featuring this character are all from the late 1930s. ""Dick Tracy"" was a comic strip animated by the pen and imagination of the London artist Chester Gould, in October 1931. Gould worked on the strips until he retired in 1977. Other artists are still producing stories 76 years after the birth of the series In the comics, police detective Tracy courted his future wife Tess Trueheart for 18 years, eventually marrying her on Christmas Day 1949. During this time, Tracy, with a square jaw, came across in legendary characters such as BB Eyes, Flattop Jones, Pruneface, Haf and Haf, 88 Keys, Mr, Crime, Sphinx, Pear-shape and Faceless Redrum, from 1935 to 1948. In the films Tracy was inte mainly interpreted by Ralph Byrd (starting from \'37). Byrd stayed with the series until the end, after a short run on early television. ""Sherlock Holmes"", the most famous fantasy detective of all, was the creation of the author and Scottish physician Arthur Conan Doyle. Holmes\' stories were published in various British magazines since 1887. Over the years Conan Doyle tried to kill the character more than once, but the public outcry made him reconsider. Doyle wrote four novels and fifty-six stories with Holmes and Dr. John Watson, his friend and cohort in adventure, until the death of the knight in 1930.

What can be said of a film in which the hero slaughters hundreds of people but can not save his wife or (later) his love interest from being burned to death and manages to save a cute puppy. This not so much for the science fiction of a futuristic `` Orwellian distinction \'\', as it is, is a recipe on how to make a science fiction film on a futuristic `` Orwellian distopia. \'\' Watching this film was like playing Trivial Pursuit. It was more fun to try to choose the various ingredients of the recipe than to watch the film. Fakeheit 451; add a cumulative aid from 1984; just a dash of Brave New World (""interval"" injections); mix in plenty of special Matrix effects; add a large shooting action with a variety of weapons (to add an extra touch to a samurai sword fight); and just a slice of pie with a scene of Christian Bale without his shirt. Mix well and cook in a crematorium (this future society incinerates not only books but works of art and social misfits) to 451 degrees until a refined glaze of existential depth is applied (there are many characters who look at the each other from the corners of their eyes and two of the characters quote Yeats\' `` Wants the role of paradise. ``) Complete with a maraschino cherry of a happy ending (visually similar to that of Fight Club) and you have Equilibrium. The premise of the film is that after an apocalyptic war, all of humanity is governed by a single government in which a figure of Big Brother maintains total control and compliance. In order to prevent conflicts, all feelings and feelings are suppressed by constant monitoring and injections of drugs. People who violate the norm dictated are hunted by ""clerics"" and eliminated from incineration. The character of Christian Bales is one of the ""clerics"". \'\' He is a single father of two whose wife has been incinerated. He is a prominent clergyman, but as the film progresses, he begins to have doubts about what he is doing. Ultimately, look for the resistance leaders of the ""clandestine"" who are, literally, underground, forced to live in a secret room full of a bunch of paintings, books, old toys and bric a brac (not unlike the bedroom of a modern teenager). Inspired by a young woman in custody and by a cute puppy, she joins the resistance.

I saw this film approach 70 times, and I know where the beats are, from top to bottom. I was looking for changes and I could not detect anyone. Even the slight leap forward as ET indicates the wardrobe as ""home"" is restored. The original ILM animation of flying motorcycles is back. The passage of the strings during the final hug is exactly where it should have always been. All the terrible tampering has been removed.

"b'This will be called a classic horror in the years to come ... a classic horrible example of how Hollywood money can destroy a really good storyline. The plot, what is there, has no resemblance to the psychological horror story of Shirley Jackson. They are shreds of plots that make no sense and blind alleys. There are a lot of special effects and CGI, which no doubt would have to make up for the missing story. They do not. Nothing here is scary, unless you find the thought of dusting the wooden cherubs in a hideous and terribly frightening way. The sets for the house were the best part, being completely bizarre and unreal and therefore worth seeing. Liam Neeson seems to have been blackmailed to take the part, and Owen Wilson, with a fixed smile rather like the aforementioned wooden cherubs, behaves as if he were in a comedy from the beginning. The women, Lili Taylor and Catherine Zeta-Jones, manage a little better considering the material they gave. Zeta-Jones looks good, is colorful and all this, but he is not given anything to do but wander around with a brightly colored look. It seems that Bruce Dern and Marian Seldes are having fun reciprocating in their roles as caretakers, but they were probably just happy to have such small parts. This does not make it a bad ""good"" movie, and it\'s not worth hating it, except that it slaughtered a book that was both frightening and intelligent.'",0

"b'""The Highwaymen"" by Robert Harmon is a frantic race that grabs you in the first frames and does not let you go until it has shaken your brain 81 minutes later. Like Rennie, Jim Caviezel gives another sentimental performance like the haunted husband who watches his wife run over by a successful driver and spends years chasing the boy. Caviezel\'s role is not as demanding or satisfying as his interpretation of Catch in ""Angel Eyes"", but it\'s well done. Colm Feore from ""Chronicles of Riddick"", ""Paycheck"" and ""Chicago"" is as threatening as the handicapped whose only enjoyment in life is to terrorize and kill women with his car. I saw the film with an occupational therapist who had numerous comments on the representation of the handicapped. Rhona Mitra, the TV star shone brilliantly in ""Party of 5"", ""Gideon\'s Crossing"", ""The Practice"" and now ""Boston Legal"" does a great job of being chased, frightened and fought. He shows a series of levels, actually more challenging than his appearances in ""The Life of David Gale"", ""Sweet Home Alabama"" or ""Get Carter"". \'\' Frankie Faison who plays the traffic inspector has 4 films coming out this year and is a busy character (White Chicks, Cookout). His police detective is a bit slow to pick up the gravity of what\'s going on and becomes the complication of Rennie\'s research, but eventually he becomes an ally with the final blow. Andrea Roth as the blonde Alex does a nice job but short before being set on the windshield of the Aldorado Cadillac. Yes, there are some holes in the storyline and some jumps in the editing, but all in all it\'s a big movie ride. To enjoy !'",1

"b'Unlike most of the other films reviewed, the reviews for this film are actually quite accurate. The film describes the rise of the celebrity of three girls from Ziegfeld; Judy\'s character rises to the celebrity, Hedy\'s character retreats into a comfortable married life, while Lana\'s character `` arrives in a cropper \'\'. The plot is too long, and the plot of Lamarr in particular is trivial and uninteresting. These are the numbers on one side, and the subplot of Turner on the other, which make this film. The story of Lana\'s rise and fall from celebrity is the only one that deserves to be seen. This delicate role was the role that marked the celebrity of Lana. Furthermore, the numbers are stellar. Some might say product in excess, but I say spectacular - more in particular, the number ""Out of a Dream"" has the most glamorous costumes ever glimpsed on the celluloid. I have never seen so much female beauty in my life; beauty floated on ethereal scales, towards the ethereal music sung by Tony Martin. You\'ll want to watch it again and again. There are some bloopers to keep an eye on: 1. In the ""Minnie from Trinidad"" number, shortly after the mule has been seen, you can see a male dancer walking on the set, in the background, very out of sync with the music. The first time I saw it, I could not believe the publisher missed it. Watch Judy VERY carefully as she treads the stairs into the ""Out of a Dream"" number; you can see glimpses of nudity as you approach the bottom of the stairs! 3. In the ""Out of a Dream"" number, all the girls are smiling ... except for Hedy Lamarr. This contrast is jarring. Hedy Lamarr\'s teeth were out of alignment in real life. She is a much more beautiful actress when she does not smile.'",1

Selecting as his hero, the charming Australian actor Rod Taylor, interpreting Herbert George Wells, the director accurately portrays the adventurous, but moody, Victorian like a gentleman, who delights with inventions and desires for a more peaceful century in which live . Using what has been hailed as the best special effects of that date, Pal launches Taylor into the future. Stopping only to observe the changing ages in which the war is fought with better and more sophisticated weapons, Wells finally arrives in the land of the Eloi. Here he meets the beautiful and sensual Weena (Yvette Mimieux) and his people. During their short period together, Weena allows Wells to learn that, despite their idyllic paradise, it is not without its dangers. In this future, it is the Morlocks who have become the masters of the world and have stolen Wells's time machine. Condemned to spend eternity in the future, Taylor engages in a battle with the Morlocks, which will result in a story that will later relate to David Filby (Alan Young) and his Victorian friends. The film is superb and despite having been redone several times, it has never been equaled. H. G. Wells would have approved. *****""",1
"b""I loved the relationship on minorities. The film made me fall in love soon and took me on a fantastic ride. The story is complex but in a short paragraph I'll talk a bit about it. John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the head of Pre-Crime in Washington D.C. and he is accused of a future murder. The film then proceeds in a wild goose hunt where he is trying to prove he has not done so. Tom Cruise is exceptional in the movie. This is one of his greatest interpretations of all time. The character sounds good. You feel for John Anderton as you watch the film relax. You feel for him because of the beautiful acting that Cruise does. Farrel is also good in the film. Sounds Danny Whitmore, a federal agent is trying to figure out if the crime works. It ends up chasing Anderton in the film. He plays the character so well. Farrel does a good job of making you hate. I love this kind of thing. The special effects in the film are among the best ever. They bring out some frightening ideas in the film that could be possible in the future. Roger Ebert said & quot; Minority report reminds us of why we go to the cinema & quot; and I could no longer agree. This is a cinematic masterpiece and a must for any DVD collection.""",1
"b'I looked back at this dvd the other day. I had not seen it for about 2 years, since I got it first. I was having trouble getting rid of a resentment I had against someone. I was so annoyed by my feelings, I could not sleep. Then I thought, \'Why do not you touch it? ""I jumped in the dvd to refresh my memory with the simple technique.In a few minutes I was touching and feeling relief.First to start tapping, my anger was about 8-9 on a scale of 0-10. , had fallen to a 2, and then as the night progressed, my anger slipped away.I like and recommend this DVD because I had the visual that a book (no matter how well written) does not provide.This is really amazing.'",1
"b'Ok, quickly and without hesitation, click the ""Back"" button on your browser as many times as necessary to avoid seeing everything that has to do with this movie. If you have not listened to my advice above, then obviously you are watching the wrecks of the train, ten stacks of cars and kids frying ants with a magnifying glass. In other words, you\'re a cinematic sadist. If you\'ve already seen this film, you\'ve probably lost a bit of self-esteem. If you\'re going to see it after reading this review ... you\'re just a masochist.Bloodrayne is horrible. Beyond horrible. Ben Kingsley made some bad career choices in his day, but this takes the cake. Michael Madsen, who was previously considered respectable if not exceptional, is heading for a career descent later than a California mud run after a monsoon. Michelle Rodriguez, who has openly declared that she wants to be a gypsy actress, a free spirit, is the most unimpaired simply because you limit yourself to that kind of professional decision. This does not hold her up for this farce. I can not imagine anyone so rebellious as she who is silent while this pile of raw is dumped around like a garbage in a landfill. And then there\'s Kristana Loken ... well, you see her naked. This is the salient moment of his role. And what the hell is Meatloaf doing in this movie ... and credited with his name FULL? ! Did you choose this atrocity to decide that you want to be credited with TWO names instead of ONE? HUH? ! All the others are unknown, which surprisingly does not leave many roles left to strangers. It was incredible how they put this group of actors named for something so horribly bad. It\'s not just the actors, it\'s the dialogue, the F / X and even the plot ... that escapes me for the moment. I guess I\'m trying to remove this film from my memory. So do yourself a favor and stay away, stay away, far away. Trust me, it\'s for your own good.'",0

"b""I know this DVD sounds great from the description (added scenes, restored, 2 discs set up etc.) But beware, it's not the real thing. For starters, the 15 minutes of added movies are NEW FILMS and horrible. Not only that, it suffers from really ugly lip synchronization problems that make it practically unwatchable. Also some original scenes have actually been removed. The other disc contains the original not slaughtered, but unfortunately has a new musical score.

"b'The Italian work of the \'60s is well known to the British public, for whom the film is a fixture of Christmas television programming as a James Bond film, The Great Escape and the Queen\'s speech. The negative reviews of US viewers are the result of a lack of cultural context and lack of familiarity with many actors in the cast. The film has aged well and offers an amusing, albeit rosy, snapshot of British culture of the 1960s. The cast includes Noel Coward as Mr Bridger, the criminal mind, and Michael Caine as the crazy Charlie Croker. The British public will recognize a number of well-known actors in cameo roles, including Benny Hill and John Le Mesurier. But the movie stars are undoubtedly the cars. Amusing, the lineup of 60s supercars including a Lamborghini Muira, an E-Type Jaguars and Charlie\'s Aston Martin are obscuring the three Mini Cooperies that drive the Italian police in an incredible car chase through Turin. Remy Julienne and her acrobatic driving team have produced one of the most surprising and well known, at least for the British public, car chases on the cinema. Probably continues to be considered one of the best sequences of car chases, especially since the acrobatics were actually turned in place in Turin (and Coventry in the case of sewage scenes) and in cars with minimal changes. There are many memorable moments in the film beyond the Mini Cooper sequence. Caine ""sweeps the doors"", Benny Hill\'s biggest lady obsesses Professor Peach on the Turin tram and the ""hanging"" ending is in my mind. The extra features of the DVD are good but not really exceptional. The documentary \'Making Of\' provides a series of interesting cues on the film. The track of overlapping comments is a bit \'pungent but worth listening to. There is only one scene eliminated, the ""Blue Danube"" machine ballet quite extraordinary on the ice. In short, this is a true English classic with a great cast, soundtrack and plot. A beautiful snapshot of the London of the 60s, a fantastic cast (at least for the British public) and the wonderful scene of car chases make this a purchase. The remake of Hollywood, while not a bad movie in its own right, only shares the title, a plot based on a gold robbery and the BMW Mini updated with the original. And for anyone who asks about the original Mini, I\'m really so small and fun to drive.'",1

The actors were very slow with the fighting scenes (as if they were practicing) and the dialogues were stupid. Talented waste for Ben Kingsley (who is always good as we all know). You can not say if the setting is in England or the United States because the actors can not decide with their accents. Waste of money and time ..'",0
"b'28 Days Later is such a well-managed film in terms of suspense, acting and meaning that every time I watch it I am more convinced that it will become a classic in the horror-skiing genre. Not so with the ""sequel"", which could be well directed by Fresnadillo, but is not well structured as a narrative, and does not lend any precious ""message"" to the public. 28 weeks later he often incurs the error of insulting our intelligence. How can you explain that the husband of the surviving woman who is detained in a health care facility can have access to the room without meeting guards, doctors, soldiers or security personnel? There are not even cameras, in a situation where the reappearance of the virus is feared and it is possible, after the diagnosis made by the medical staff of the survivor. In reality, this is the key event that originates the virus violation. Furthermore, the film is so focused on bloodshed, the bite and the vampire race, that no meaningful dialogue is possible, avoiding making sense of chaos. And what can you say about the helicopter used as a mortal saw to decapitate dozens of zombies-vampires? The least I can say is that the scene is the pinnacle of sensationalism. And insisting on the meaning of the film, because such a valuable element in history as the chance that the survivor, or her children, are in possession of the key to cure the virus, is just a waste to leave the public with a terrible ending, pessimistic and fatal? Is it a bait for another sequel, parallel to the ""Alien"" series? Meanwhile, there remains a ""sequel"" that does not honor correctly 28 days later, regardless of whether Boyle is among the producers.'",0
"b""Too bad that Bruce Willis can not get this film out more often. John McClain is probably the greatest action hero in the history of cinema and this episode contains a lot of action and humor. McClain is invited to bring a suspected cyber hacker who will be questioned by the FBI. The actor who plays this hacker is the guy who makes the McIntosh apple. Interestingly, it seems to prefer a Mac in this. However, McClain shows up just as the hacker is about to be hit by the bad guys. If it were another movie it would be a guy with a magnum wire or a piano, but being a Die Hard movie the villains come with ultra modern machine guns. Obviously McClain is able to get some out and get away with the hacker temporarily. So we have the prerequisites for a great collaboration as good as that of lethal weapons films. The film makes you applaud everywhere, especially when McClain taunts the evil one about dismissing one of his key followers and then telling him that I'm coming to Kevin Smith he has a bigger cameo like Warlock, a live at home with his computer hacker. It's a role that seems to have been done for him. This is the best Die Hard from the first movie!""",1
"b""I had no idea that Ganz was in him for being so great until I saw him here as Hitler. Even Alexandra Maria Lara as her young and naive secretary is very good. The cast is excellent. Director Oliver Hirschbieger cleverly manages to put it all together and will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way - even if we all know how the story is over. The film gets you under your skin and it rattles you a lot after you've seen this - and that's a trick. How have the producers of this film been able to do this? Avoiding the usual approach of making Hitler and his SS homicide thugs as two-dimensional cartoon characters, instead show that many of them are what they were: human. Assassinated, misguided, fanatical, barbaric, cold-blooded mass murderers - and all in the pursuit of power (which they never achieved), but in no way human. What is sad here, as far as I am concerned, instead of encouraging your nation to concentrate all its energy on making the world a better place, because the Germans, the German people, have given us much more than beautiful cars and good ones beer and photographic objectives ... Hitler and his thugs had their people squandering all that potential to cause destruction and chaos, misery and pain ... for nothing. I realize that quite a few Germans did not worry about Hitler and his crazy notions ... only that there was not much they could do (once they got into power and saw where he was actually carrying them .. directly to hell). Any German who opposed the feared SS and the Gestapo ended up dead or in some camp to suffer the consequences. I always wondered how Hitler and his people were supposed to be in that bunker during the last months / weeks / days. .. This powerful video shows you what happened - and then some.""",1
"b""Anyone reading these reviews will have seen the television production and discovered it to the full; so I will limit my review to the quality of the DVD image - or rather to the lack of it. It is a pity that what was a beautiful and memorable TV movie has become a battered and faded shadow of his previous self. It is painful to see something that contains a special place in your heart to be treated so squalid. For years the only version that millions of people had seen on TV had a faded color and a low contrast that seemed to be practically shot in black and white! If this is what you're used to, the & quot; restored & quot; the version of this DVD (and the one shown on TV in the last 3 or 4 years) seems slightly better, but has just been restored. Just look at a canceled song in the extras section to see how beautiful and bright the original production is: clear, clear, pristine, with very saturated colors. Time and money SHOULD have been spent to bring the rest of the film to this level. It is morally wrong to put a defective product on the market, so have the courage to charge money for it. As many of our parents probably told us when we were young, & quot; Whatever is worth doing, it's worth doing it right! & quot;""",0

"b'I\'ve just finished watching this movie. It\'s slow, yes, but there is also no real storyline, PERIOD. The actors lack skills except for the protagonist Jasmine who could have potential over time. The scenes did not connect and were extremely discontinuous. It is my strong opinion that the other reviews MUST be linked to the producer / writer / actor in order to give any kind of positive review. This film is truly sacrilegious, blasphemous and disrespectful to the Church and God. I am not a ""holy roller"", but I feel there should be some things that are respected and not derided. If they were trying to convey a concept, it was VERY badly done.'",0

Bill Murray is particularly good at being a bad villain and Vanessa Angel deserved to be a great star. She is both beautiful and talented.

"b""For the most part I really enjoyed most of the things Paul Anderson did; nothing extraordinary but still decent stuff. So I was not ready to condemn this film before seeing it in the theater. I was hoping it would have done a lot more with this franchise than what this film turned out to be, but I still found it quite fun to buy the DVD and now Blu-Ray (I definitely think it's a better movie than the second Predator and 3rd and 4th Aliens.) Blu-Ray includes the director's unregistered cut and the added scenes help explain a little more about the story and is definitely the best version to watch. The acting is quite blah (with A & P acting like most humans) although Ewen Bremner is fun. But the action is really what this film is about and there's a lot of action here and what I thought was a very good ending. As for the Blu-Ray transfer, it is very good; the image is very clear and the dark scenes (most of the film) are very beautiful. Also the soundtrack is beautiful and the extra feature is cool.""",1
"b'This version of Jane Eyre is one of my favorites. I excitedly preordered this DVD a month ago when I discovered it. Unfortunately, I can only give this DVD two stars. That\'s a better star than the last ""remastered"" version I\'ve reviewed ... the extra star is due to the fact that THIS at least does not miss an entire scene. Since being remastered, he said that this version is, if you can believe it, even worse than the one I\'ve reviewed. Firstly, it is dark and muddy - I had to almost completely raise the brightness of my TV to see any detail. Secondly, the image is almost constantly full of long scratches (sometimes right in the middle), both black and white ""drop-outs"", and a hair or fiber that appears at the top of the screen for the duration of titles. Thirdly, the color fluctuates several times over the course of the film. Fourth, in some scenes the sound is a bit scratchy. And on top of the release company (VCI Entertainment), not content to lie on their packaging, had the GALL to insert `` This moving Image Special Edition has been digitally restored to its current condition \'\' before the film. There is ""truth in advertising"" for you. I can not understand why it is so impossible to get a good release of this film. But I\'m tired of releasing companies that are lying about remastering it.

"b'A deliberately silent film ultimately suffers from having too much star energy. No matter how much the filmmakers try to make Nicole Kidman look like, it\'s still Nicole Kidman. His portrait of a janitor really pushes the limits of the ""suspension of disbelief"" with its delicate features and legs that go on forever. And even Anthony Hopkins is a mixture like a Jewish professor with a hard blow, a secret past. While he remains one of my favorite actors, he can not escape his ""Britishness"", which is even more incredible once he has discovered his character\'s past! The real discovery of this film is Wentworth Miller\'s absolutely astonishing turnaround as teenager Anthony Hopkins. Ultimately, the film deserves to be seen only for Wentworth Miller. But the casting of two Hollywood actors megawatt hurts the credibility of this film in the end.'",0
"b""Werner Herzog is the perfect and unique incarnation of the director always worried, irreverent, dissatisfied and non-conformist who likes to walk on the razor's edge and delights in exposing extreme situations on the eve of reaching the boiling point. That's why all his cinematography was signed for novelties and original proposals, characterized by unexplored territories and unthinkable stages. In this case, we witness the clash between two visibly differentiated civilizations, the ancestral aborigines and the western lifestyle, where myth and progress collide like the inevitable crash of two trains that move each of them, in opposite directions. A company will settle in the middle of the Australian desert, in order to explore and exploit the reserves of uranium. But they will be faced by ancestral tribes who oppose them because they will interrupt the dream of green ants. A film dedicated to the mother of Herzog, with intriguing and acute reflections to the end, when this case will be discussed in the Supreme Court, through a very interesting trial, where the happy ending will be absent. The final sequence will invite you to think and reflect.""",1
"b'To start off, I\'m a lifelong bodybuilder and a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger, so even though he\'s strictly co-starring in this, I\'m obviously biased.

Examples: Joe Santo (Arnold) is putting Craig Blake (Jeff Bridges) during a workout and advises him, ""You can not grow without burning!` `, And we come to understand how deep it was when Joe repeats those words as the two disputes only because Mary Tate Farnsworth (Sally Field) left Joe for Craig, and there\'s Craig Albert\'s uncle, whose voice is sometimes heard by reading letters to Craig, saying, ""No matter what you do, as long as you do something , and do it without sparing. \'\'.

"b'SCURO SCURO is as exciting as watching someone making banana pudding. Shot in Czechoslovakia, most of the actors and names of the crew end in ""v"". Which would not be so bad if they could at least ACT. Dean Cain, the man of Superman fame, makes his way into the confusion, chewing gum and grimacing after being hit in the leg. Scott Wiper, who plays his jealous companion, disappears mercifully when he stops, but the film never says what happens to him. The film starts with Cain and Wiper (looks like a law firm, right?) In the face of some really bad guys who are obviously attacking women in this submarine. Nothing is ever explained about why they are doing it, but Cain kills them all but one, a bad boy who plans revenge. Meanwhile, many crew members are committing suicide and Cain is investigating. (Excited yet?). Of course, it all culminates in a sort of HIGH NOON underwater when the villain who promises to come back, does it with two other henchmen, and chases Cain for a while. There is nothing exciting in all this, since the direction is wood and the abysmal acting.

"b'I saw this film about a month ago at the local film library. After about eighty minutes I looked discreetly at my watch and was dismayed by the awareness that the film was not even halfway. Celine and Julie go boating? There had not been a body of water, not to say a boat, in sight until then. Where was this bizarre story with the scenes repeated endlessly, and when would it end? I\'m a patient movie viewer, but this was too much. A number of film critics, whose opinions usually respect, have practically built religions around their appreciation for this film. I asked myself if this could only be a case of ""new clothes of the emperor""? Almost two hours later it was all over and I left the theater thinking I had seen two real cinema masterpieces in time that I had wasted in Rivette\'s film ... But somehow it was not really over. The effect of the film has continued. It was not just an intellectual riddle I needed to try my hand at, but the film had fallen under my skin. The scenes kept repeating themselves in my head like a strange dream. Their pace was unlike anything I had encountered before. Celine and Julie never conformed to any of my expectations - nor Jacques Rivette. In two separate scenes in the film, Celine and Julie present themselves to men, who unwittingly think they are meeting the other woman. In both cases the two women completely subvert the worlds of men, jokingly playing holes in their rigid conventionality. Throughout the whole movie, Rivette was doing the same thing with me. Everything about the film, from its ""plot"" to its subtle manipulation of reality at its own pace, forces you to let go of your expectations (or be unhappy trying to hold them back). You must relate to the film at its own level, as you might do with a child. Only then can you enjoy it. I do not know exactly why the film had such an effect on me but says something about its power that I\'m still thinking about more than a month later. In the last days I\'ve had this growing need to see `` Celine and Julie Go Boating \'\' again. The ideal circumstance for a first encounter with it is certainly in a theater or you could end it off. Now that I\'ve crossed that Rubicon I\'d like it to be available on a DVD region 0 or 1, so I could waste another three hours.'",1
"b""& quot; Back to the future & quot; it could be the most enchanting comedy / adventure there is. The film is a science fiction tale about a young man who accidentally travels back in time between the 30s and the 50s. While minor science fiction films focus on the ideas of temporal paradoxes and hardware, & quot; Back to the future & quot; focuses on wonder with open eyes, charming characters and good humor. The story begins with Marty McFly in the year 1985. Marty is a hopeless slacker with two crazy parents and a mad scientist best friend. Marty's friend, Doc Brown, has perfected a plutonium-powered time machine modeled by a DeLorean sports car. After a successful test, Marty was accidentally transplanted in the year 1955 and stranded there, he left his extra plutonium in 1985. What happens next is a series of wonderful surprises while Marty interacts with the inhabitants of the 50s while looking for the younger version of Doc. Brown, but what is even more surprising and magical is the relationship of Marty with her parents as teenagers. The film takes the perspective of a young man of his losing parents and makes him understand that once his parents were full of hope and fear. Finally he meets his parents for the first time. The film also suggests the hope that you can go back in time and help your parents when they need it most, as Marty certainly does. While the film is a light-hearted game, there is a lot of action as Doc Brown devises an electrifying scheme to bring Marty back to the future involving lightning, lots of visual effects and a high-tech run. & quot; Back to the future & quot; it's the most perfect mix of science fiction, comedy and adventure.

"b'""I Know Who Killed Me"" is a horrible little horror film conceived as a sort of ""comeback"" vehicle for Lindsay Lohan in early 2007. Needless to say, the film failed in that effort. Whatever, ma.Lohan plays Aubrey Fleming, an attractive but relatively naive high school student who falls prey to a tortured, crazy serial killer who manages to cut off some of her limbs before she miraculously escapes her clutches. When he wakes up in the hospital, he is believed to be a girl named Dakota Moss, a sort of fictitious ""alter ego"" with a life directly from a soft-porn novel - which gives us ample opportunity to observe the Lohan, dressed in succinctly, while contorting in slow-motion performing in polar dances on a squalid striped joint. Aubrey, who is herself a fiction writer, simply a victim of repression, a wild and free spirit so obsessed with being a ""good girl"" that allowed her true nature to remain buried in her subconscious all this years? And is it the trauma that simply suffered the vehicle through which that true nature can now come to the fore? Or is there another explanation, less purely psychological - let\'s say, symbiotic twins? - for this sudden change of identity? It does not really matter what the answers to these questions are, because this depressing raid in sadism, the dismemberment and the supernatural hocus pocus are badly written, acted in an amateur way and completely devoid of chills or common sense. In fact, history itself could have had some validity if it had not forced the public to bask in unpleasant sorrows. But, as it is, every time we begin to develop even the slightest interest in what is happening, we are subjected to another round of bloodshed. How disgusting .'",0
"b'This 1914 film is considered the first feature film ever made and, as such, deserves to be seen only for that. The film on merit, however, is less interesting. Sure, it\'s disgusting, but I personally found the character of Tillie quite ridiculous; ridiculous, moreover, without being particularly funny. He looks similar to that - and seems to act like ... - a guy who brings a confraternity to pledge. Marie Dressler, then forty-five, to play a character so presumably young as ""Tillie"", to boot, is less comical than distracting. If you\'re going to take the time to see this movie, in other words, you should do it simply to see a historically significant film. So, no, it\'s not a film you\'d most likely want to own and watch again and again, unless you\'re simply in love with everything Chaplin has done. If you have not seen anything about Chaplin do not start here! And if you\'re a shrewd fan of Chaplin, you should be better served (if you want to be entertained) by tasting some of his major efforts. For the curious, I offer a brief synopsis of Tillie\'s Punctured Romance: ""What is this that has - one of Ringling\'s elephants?"" Thus observes the character of Mabel Normand (so to speak, in this silent film) while spying on "" city \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bboy ""of Chaplin with"" Built like a warship ""Tillie. Tillie has ""got a bankroll as big as her"", Chaplin\'s character later explains to Normand, his old crime partner. Then, once he managed to raise the money from Tillie, Chaplin flees with Normand. After listening to Tillie\'s apparent $ 3 million legacy shortly thereafter, however, she returns to her and begs Tillie to marry him as soon as possible. Later, they started with a lot of research (with Normand who was working as help) at a celebratory party at the Tillies house, ""until"" his uncle - he thought dead - came back to claim it, throwing them back out into the street while doing it. A chase from tombstone policemen follows the whole city and the sea along a catwalk and ends with Normand and (a wet soaking) Tillie who accepts that Chaplin\'s favor is not worth pursuing.

"b'Having grown up with the original Thunderbirds on TV (also in B & W), I was hoping for something better. I suppose that while I\'m moving forward a bit, teenage adolescence does not attract much anymore. I wanted to see the cars, the drama, the tension of people facing disasters that brought them beyond themselves, the triumph of honest people on the impersonal malevolence of nature, and all those good things that the original had in abundance, along with a friendliness and humor that did not take themselves too seriously. The original spoke before the adventure, with incidental ""romance"", and this is an important point, rather lost in this film. This is a teenage ""growth"" film that uses Thunderbirds as a cover. He really did not need the Thunderbirds part, except for the sets. The plot is otherwise perfectly ordinary and can be seen everywhere. The degree of improbability involved is far greater than the original and somewhat difficult to bear. The acting leaves a lot to be desired, and yes, the 1960s puppets were often much more realistic than the actors in this film, and Ben Kingsley does not actually perceive him as evil, or even evil. So, if you want a film for teenagers like many others, this is for you. If you want something like the original, do not worry about this movie. Wait for someone to have the courage to produce an \'adult\' film (rated \'G\') in the classical genre. Unfortunately, this is not a particularly memorable film.'",0
"b""Watch the American In Paris Blu-Ray and you'll know what's wrong with Gigi. The opening sequence is grainy. Transitions from one scene to another are bad.

If it had not been for the extras, especially for the French Gigi of 1949, I would have downloaded it. Gigi is a great movie and one of my favorites, but I expected better quality from Blu-Ray.

"b'Carole Lombard was a beautiful, intelligent natural blonde, the biggest female comedian Screwball, highest paid actress, wife of Clark Gable and one of the most powerful women of Hollywood in the \'30s until her untimely death in 1942. This beautifully restored DVD gives us a taste of Carole Lombard and the effect it had on the public of the \'30s. This was his only Technicolor film he had ever made. So sit back and watch her natural beauty and the genius of acting evolve on the screen. Fredric March as co-star adds to this adorably humorous film. In summary: a girl from Vermont, Hazel Flagg (Lombard), diagnosed with radio poisoning (terminal). A hot shot New York Jounalist (March) talks about it in a newspaper and wants to use this event to increase the popularity of its magazines by sponsoring Hazel. Take her to New York City and present her with ""Keys to the City"" and VIP status raises a great public awareness. All the time public sympathy is used to increase magazine sales. Hazel discovers she has been misdiagnosed and reluctantly continues with the scam. Meanwhile, in March, she begins to fall in love with Hazel and he wants her to rest and feel at ease until the end. As you can see, this has a strange blow of events, which is the main ingredient of the ""COMMENTS SCREWALL"" of the \'30s. Prove that `` Nothing \'s Sacred\' \'! ! ! Extras include: 2 first silent films in Lombardy and Gable & Lombard home movies. It is a collection DVD ""LIMITED EDITION"" to have.'",1
"b""First let me say that as a former military, I'm a big fan of this film. I am also aware of the fact that when writing a review of something here, there are too many ad hominem attacks, and no refutation of the review, which makes me reluctant to comment on anything. That said, I have to admit that I am very disappointed with this problem of the Four Feathers Criterion. I always thought that Criterion's DVDs were the best, and I thought the Blu-ray edition would be absolutely spot on, however, this is not the case. I own a MGM version of the film, and I found it was overall superior to Criterion's. I do not know if I'm unlucky and I received a bad copy of the film, but I'll send it back to Amazon and I'll stay with my copy of MGM. Problems to mention: the Criterion edition, although sharper, has a very stained color transfer, excessively bright in some places and with some discoloration in others. There are no subtitles in the DVD Criterion, but the MGM version has them, in several languages. I noticed that in different parts of the film the color fades and fades, and the backgrounds appear washed, as if the film had been colored. As I said, please do not personally attack me for this review. If your copy of this film is better than the one I wrote about, then it's good for you. I will continue to return the dvd to Amazon and I will lose. This is just the opinion of a man.""",0

This must be one of those films of love or hate because the ranking on Amazon is in line with other places, including IMDB.""",1
"b""This is one of my favorite movies. Its quality is typical of what I expected from a reconstruction of the criterion. Something along the lines of HDTV in black and white. It is so good The story itself is situated at the beginning of the Great Patriotic War of Russia (WWII). The story covers every inch of human behavior including happiness, love, pain, deception, manipulation and heroism against all odds. The last quarter of the film is a stunning surprise, as it is built towards a final scene that is nothing but a great tribute to the best of what makes us human. Even war movie fans (like me) can expect a blurred vision at the end of this film. Not at all fussy, this film will agree with viewers of any country and of many generations. It is not a single viewing disk. I do not even know if it has a soundtrack in English, since the tone of the Russian soundtrack combined with very well-made English subtitles offers a good connection with the film for non-Russians too.

"b'Spoiler forward, but then again, who is not familiar with Casablanca, even if you have not seen it? I have watched ""Casablanca"" over and over since I bought the Special Edition DVD, and is there any film out there that you can see again and again without ever getting tired of it? And any film likes a wider audience? Precisely everything related to it seems to be as close to perfection as only it can be. But what exactly is so special? Is it his great mix of genres, never equaled by another film? When we think of ""Casablanca"", we remember it as a romantic movie (well, most of us do it). But then again, it is also a drama involving terror, murder and escape. It can be called a character study, centered on Rick. And there are some moments of comic delight, just think of the pickpocket (""This place is full of vultures, vultures everywhere!"") Or the elderly couple on the last night before their emigration to the United States (""What looks?` ` But \'Casablanca\' is not only a great ensemble, but remains in the foreground if we divide it and only look at the individual lines of dialogue, scenes or performances.There are some other films that have a more interesting dialogue than ""Casablanca"" \'\' Pulp Fiction \'is in my mind here, and\' All About Eve \'and\' Sunset Blvd. \'you come close, but I still think that\' Casablanca \'outweighs everything else, and not only is dialogue great, it\'s delivered in an unforgettable way, especially by Humphrey Bogart (""I\'ve been misinformed"") and by Claude Rains (""I\'m shocked, shocked to find out that gambling is happening here""). ... Many scenes have become part of the history of cinema the duel of ""Die Wacht am Rhein"" and ""La Marseillaise"" is probabilme One of the greatest scenes ever filmed (the only thing I can think of rivaling for first place is Hynkel and the Chaplin world \'The Great Dictator\'), and the last scene is probably familiar to the few people who they have never seen \'Casablanca\'. Am I the only one who is absolutely convinced that the film would not have become what it is today if Rick and Ilsa were to become the lucky couple? About the performances: There has been a lot of talk about the uniqueness of the chemistry of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman as Rick and Ilsa, of the excellent turn of Claude Rains as Renault, of the performances stolen from the scene of Peter Lorre (one of the 10 biggest actors of all time) like Ugarte and Sydney Greenstreet as Ferrari and on Dooley Wilson who interrupted the show as Sam. I would like to emphasize here two other performances, one that is not mentioned quite often and one that is blatantly neglected: Conrad Veidt as Major Strasser has had a very difficult task here, since his character is the only evil one, but still Strasser does not is a one-dimensional character, and it took more than 50 years until another actor gave a performance (perhaps even more) of a Nazi, Ralph Fiennes in \'Schindler\'s List\'. But because no one ever mentions S. K. Sakall, who plays Carl, the cheerful waiter at Rick\'s Caf & eacute; I am & eacute; Ricain, it\'s beyond me. He definitely has more time on the screen of Lorre, Greenstreet and Wilson, and probably about as much as Veidt, and is a joy whenever he is on screen. I just love his reaction when the pickpocketer (""The vultures everywhere!"") Accidentally comes across him, or the reaction to the ""diary of that clock"". Or as he says he gave Strasser the best table, ""being a German, he would have taken it anyway"". His performance is simply criminally neglected. Is there a weaker link in ""Casablanca""? Every film, no matter how close to perfection, has a flaw or two minor, so you can find them even in ""Casablanca"" if you really strive. So yes, one could ask how much sense the whole mumbo jumbo has on the transit letters. It could be emphasized that Paul Henreid, although his performance is certainly good, does not come close to the greatness of any of his co-stars. However, the film is so close to perfection that I am almost ashamed to try desperately to find anything but perfect elements. So, any movie will come, how many sequels will overflow the screen, and how much we will sweep away. we will have to sit down, one thing is certain if we are desperate to see a great movie: we will always have Casablanca!'",1
"b""First of all let me say that I loved the film. I liked it so much that I bought a digital copy to download and continue with my Kindle Fire. The problem came when, according to Amazon's technical help, DreamWorks decided they were not making enough sales in the DVD area, and blocked this from streaming content on what they called a blackout period. Which in turn caused the removal of the copy purchased by my Kindle by Amazon and blocking the streamed version. Amazon returned my money, but it made me very cautious about making future digital purchases. Just a warning for any digital movie purchase from Dreamworks.""",0
"b'This is the first Star Trek movie in which the people of the Next Generation are present. Even some of the original characters are involved. This is where it starts to go down. We are presented with the tri-lithium substance, which can kill the suns. In the end, the data has human emotions, and the two captains work side by side. However, they turn the 1701-D into a weak ship, making it come out of a single shot (not even a save, actually) from an obsolete, delapidated klingon bird-raptor / scout-class wessel (as Mr. Chekov would call it ) that was imperfect while on duty. I understand that they wanted a known set, but would have to die harder. And the death of Admiral Kirk was not enough to do it justice. This was supposed to be a transitional film, but the first generation, while not really coming out with a whimper, certainly did not come out with a bang. It was more like a moan.'",0
"b""Dumbo is a classic Disney movie, which is iconic in its images of pink elephants and the poor little elephant with ears too big to fit the elephant society. This is a very sad and bittersweet movie when Dumbo is removed from his mother who finds himself for the lost son. Dumbo must find his identity and find a way not to be chosen at all times. Originally published in 1941, Dumbo lasts only 63 minutes. The special features of the Big Top Edition far exceed the functionality itself. There is a game that teaches children about circus animals, a storybook, two long songs, a music video, several Disney shorts. Outside of the commentary and short films, little here is of value or interest to the adult. The real problem with this new edition of `` Big Top '' is that it is not significantly different than the `` 60th Anniversary Edition ''. There is a different music video, adding a function and losing others. The quality of the film itself is not dramatically different from the previous version. Really, Dumbo is a Disney movie that is worth possessing. But it makes no difference which edition you buy. - Joe Sherry""",1

"b'Mike Leigh\'s films are all improvised; almost all of them are interesting. Usually they are dear Oscar and ""Vera Drake"" is no exception. I will not say the plot, because if you\'re reading this, you already know it. Imelda Staunton is really magnificent. I only saw the film recently, and at last year\'s Oscar I thought it would win, because of the party that seems to involve Swank & Bening, the only times they were involved. I thought the votes would be divided, as often happens. Imelda was kind, glorious, sweet and down to earth in this performance, a true amalgam of acting ability. Mike Leigh also used Brenda Blethyn in ""Secrets and Lies"". A formidable story and an interesting part of the story, this film is wonderful, especially when it comes to the other characters involved, who are all excellent. Mr. Leigh is brilliant and uses female characters well; I hope he soon moves away from that improvisation instrument that requires women to whine and cry a group. Imelda\'s whimper was annoying, but in ""Secrets and Lies,"" Blethyn\'s was distracting. Yet, a wonderful demonstration of acting, and a good person with good intentions that, unfortunately, were against the law. They are pro-life, at some point; I almost understood Vera\'s motivations, especially about rape. In the early 1950s, frivolous behavior was not accepted as now, and Vera was there to be a friend. The film deserves to be seen. Its historical importance in perspective is priceless. The family was created to be so important. This is good .'",1

"b'The websites that track the positive and negative reviews of the major critics have a positive score of at least 95% for Ratatouille, putting it clearly at the top of the 2007 films. Is this the best movie of the year? No, but it is the one that has the greatest appeal, given that almost everyone will consider the vision as a positive experience. Ratatouille follows Remy, a curious rat who aspires to be more than a garbage thief. The acute sense of smell and appreciation for Remy\'s food attract him to the culinary arts. Stealing what he can from an appreciation of homeowners for cooking shows and books, Remy becomes a devotee of one of the most famous French chefs, Auguste Gusteau \'. After Remy discovers that Gusteau has died years and was watching the replies of his television program, the little mouse begins to be guided by Ben Kenobi as the spirit of the late chef. Following the spirit leads him finally to the former restaurant of Gusteau, which was taken over by an artless capitalist who uses the image of Gusteau to sell frozen burritos and corndogs. Using a young kitchen worker as a means, Remy tries to rebuild Gusteau\'s reputation and return his restaurant to his glory. The resulting action is an often fascinating tale of a mouse so dedicated to finding himself as to achieving his goal. A lot of laughs are found when his family comes in search of handouts, and the main antagonists (the owner and a food critic) create real dramatic moments of danger. Remy is really a ""hero"" movie, someone devoted to a cause that he believes will make the world a better place. Despite not having the heart of the Toy Story movies or the comic genius of the first Shrek, Ratatouille continues the trend of the renaissance of animation that has provided some of the best films of the last decade.'",1

Ronald Colman was reluctant to play the role of Sidney Carlton, that charming but dissolute attorney who commits the utmost personal sacrifice ... ... It took a lot to convince Colman to shave his branded mustache for the role of Carlton, but he delivered more than likely his best performance (later in his life, Colman admitted that this was his favorite of all his roles). The moving classic of Charles Dicken of the Paris and London of the seventeenth century and the events surrounding the French Revolution have been filmed as silences on four different occasions - twice in Britain and America - this easily remains the ultimate masterpiece. Under the meticulous direction of Jack Conway, A TALE OF TWO CITIES offers memorable interpretations of a refined cast, including the wonderful Hamman Blanche Yurka, the frightening Lucille LaVerne, the actress Edna May Oliver, the despicable Basil Rathbone, the eloquent Henry B. Walthall (it was the `` Little Colonel '' in BIRTH OF A NATION) and, in a radical change of direction, the Dimititaria Isabel Jewell, like the pathetic sewing machine that accompanies Colman to the place of his execution.""",1

That's all ... a story. People can not understand that this is a fiction novel? Brown never states that this is a completely true story. It presents facts throughout the book, but mixes them with fiction for a purpose ... to create an interesting book that will sell. This movie / book was a good fantasy story ... it had an interesting plot, and it made a lot of money. Well, I'll stop preaching now and leave you with my advice ... read the book if you want to get involved in a very interesting FICTIONAL story. If you have a few hours to kill (and you do not like reading) and you have absolutely nothing to do, take a nap (do not waste time with the film ... read the book).

"b'What can I say about this uninvolved ""review"" of Bret\'s first novel? The film adaptation does not contain the scenes and the tone that I thought would make the book so obsessive and memorable. (The boy died in the scene of the alley, the snuff film with the underage girl ...) This film can not be claimed to be based on the book - it is more than inspired by the novel. Despite this ruin, the film deserves to be seen by any Bret Easton Ellis fan - if only to satisfy their curiosity. The film contains neither the absolutely depressing lines or the delightfully disturbing minor characters that make the book so interesting and engaging (The Clay Sisters, Spin) The film made it seem like Julian was the main character, while I always thought the novel was based on seeing the events unfold through Clay\'s eyes. One of the most captivating parts of the novel is Clay\'s ""flashbacks"" at a better time, before he left for school. The film only touches this at the beginning, and the flashback is about Blair, not his parents, who were the subjects of the flashbacks I found most interesting. The dinner scene between Clay and his father is pure genius. The separation between father and son made me shudder physically. This scene is not at all included in the film. The unfortunate thing about adapting movies to books is that something is almost always lost in ""translation"". \'American Psycho\' is really the only one of the films adapted from his books that I believe captures the tone of the book and at the same time I compose it in a legible narration without losing Bret\'s style, and this is due to the fact that Bateman himself is the narrator. All in all, \'Less Than Zero\' is not a bad movie, really. Only a bad adaptation. Capture what was fantastic and forgettable about the popular film of the \'80s, and adapt to the amusing teenage drama of that era (including the extravagant use of cocaine by minors, too much New Wave, the star of the future, a hot but potential time of Where Are They Now? James Spader). There are some moving moments, but it seems that the film has tried to find a conclusion that the book does not have (and had a reason not to). After all, Julian does not die in the novel, and Blair certainly does not return to Camden with Clay (Morrissey would not be proud). What\'s so melancholy in the novel? alludes to him: how angry, apathetic, and lost Clay is now that he has changed and acquired a new perspective, while his friends, unfortunately, do not have it.And a serious complaint: where is the board of Disappear Here ? It is an integral part of the imagination of the novel, and is absent in the film (unless I have missed it). All in all: if you\'re a fan of Bret\'s books, give this movie a chance. It\'s worth looking at once, but do not be upset if it even attempts to capture the mood or purpose of the novel.'",0

I have a confession, anyway. I'm really, really in love with Azura, Queen of Magic! [I do not want this to go around]! For some reason, he presented my first prepuberal sexual awakening. I was eight years old. It could have been her glacial beauty, her imperious contempt or her ability to turn adult men into clay and vanish on the spot. I do not know . She died in chapter 13. It is an ignominious death in a suburb of Mars. Worse, he was in the hands of his own guards. I only know that if I had been there, it would have turned out different! The computer presented me with magic beyond his dreams. I could get this DVD and do a search for my queen. Queen Azura was played by Beatrice Roberts. The actress was born in Manhattan in 1905. As a young woman she participated in several beauty contests including Miss America. He had a short-term marriage with Robert Ripley [Believe It or Not], and a long-term alliance with Louis B. Mayer [MGM]. She appeared in a series of quality B [maybe C] films, often unaccredited. I still carry a torch for her. In truth, it would be as old as my grandmother. On the screen, however, it retains a regal charm. Beatrice Roberts finally vanished in the darkness and was apparently buried in Plymouth, Massachusetts, near my hometown. If I ever find his grave, I will stop and plant violets.""",1
"b""While Timberlake and Sigfried give intense interpretations, the general theme of the film is tired. In a world where time is not so precious, this is not a total waste, but it's not the best film I've ever seen.""",0
"b'When I met Across the Universe for the first time, it seemed a little esoteric, even with the Beatles\' musical pedigree. But from the first minute Jim Sturgess sings ""Girl"" - it all makes sense. You really have to respect how well the Beatles musical legacy has been woven into this effort. Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr have been part of the greatest music of the 20th century and besides being a good movie, Across the Universe really sets it in focus. The power of the songs comes to life at every corner. Imagined in a unique way with a beautiful artistic direction and cinematography, Across the Universe expertly weaves the Beatles in the socio-political context of the times when the songs were written. A warm greeting to the director Julie Taymor and the team who clearly understood it very well, and to the excellent cast that sings better than anyone else. This is a real prowess, considering that he could have come out of a good mood or badly done. The actor Sturgess reminds me of a young Paul McCartney but that\'s where the resemblance to anything that the Beatles end. It\'s a pity that Across the Universe was not successful in the cinemas, but I suspect the treatment may have been too smart for today\'s audience. It is a film that comes from the heart that every Beatles fan should watch and who is curious about music can take a look.'",1
"b'Amazon is still combining movie reviews. There are about half a dozen DVD versions of ""The Snows of Kilimanjaro"". Amazon combines all these reviews, so if you get a DVD with excellent quality or terrible quality all the reviews are applied to all the DVD versions available for the sale. I bought the most expensive ""The Snows of Kilimanjaro (Remastered Edition)"" and the quality is terrible. It seems that the film was shot through a dirty window. The DVD case has black trim and shows Ava Gardner and Gregoty Peck sitting at a dining table. Avoid this version! Now I will try to buy other versions of this film from Amazon I hope to find the one and only good. I have read all the other reviews and have not been able to determine with certainty what the official version of the study is. Amazon\'s policy of combining movie reviews is financially wasteful and harmful to the environment. UPDATE: Buy the one with the red / brown border (the mountain tops are visible above Ava Gardner and Gregoty Peck on the housing). This DVD looks fantastic! !'",0
"b'First of all, I want to thank all the reviewers here. It\'s their reviews of this beautiful film that tempted me to buy it (that, and the fact that the director also did ""Breaker Morant"" - one of my favorites). I\'m a big fan of this kind. I loved ""Dances with Wolves"" and ""Jeremiah Johnson"", and I loved ""The Last of the Mohicans"" and ""The Last of the Dogmasters"", but none of these excellent films is comparable with the absolute realism depicted in ""Black Robe"". This is a simple story set at the beginning of the seventeenth century ... a story of a French Jesuit priest who was accused by his superiors of canoeing to a Huron outpost 1500 miles away (with the help of the Indian scouts and an interpreter) and helps convert the Huron Indians into Christianity, thus saving their souls. In this film the protagonist is not a superhero who makes no mistakes, shows no weaknesses, can shoot and ride any living man. On the contrary, it is only a young priest full of self-justice, ignorance, fear and doubt. But despite this (or for this), his courage is unmatched. This is a story of real people fighting for their lives every single day against the breathtaking hardness of nature and against other Indian tribes. This is also a story about the clash between two very different cultures. This is shown with a disturbing subtlety, but the effects are devastating. `` Black Robe \'\' goes where a few films have gone before, or since then. It\'s a film worthy of an Oscar like no other I\'ve ever seen. The cinematography is grim, cold and implacable, as is the story. Between 1 and 10, I give this reference film a solid 9. It\'s really one of my favorites.'",1
b'Notice why a single positive review was made on April 5th or April 11th? And notice how this film is the only one that each of them has ever reviewed on Amazon? Is not it vaguely suspicious? I guess the only way to sell a lousy movie is to publish fake reviews.',0
"b""This is a clear rip off by Amazon that plays on the current popularity of Bradley Cooper and hoping that no one can investigate beyond the 2 minute preview to go online to discover the film. I later found out that the film is an independent film made in 2002. The worst part was the charge of an HD quality price of $ 4.99 for a low-budget film. The protagonist is a young woman who grew up in a carnival where it is normal to create an illusion and snatch the suckers - and that's exactly what I feel happened here!""",0
"b""This was supposed to be the most painful DVD experience I've ever had. The music on DVD was so idiotic that it stifled everything, making it completely incomprehensible. In any case, like the music, the producer seemed to want the video of himself that walked in almost every shot. Not to mention almost the whole DVD is made up of collages of images superimposed on each other, making them never clear enough to be seen correctly. I bought hundreds of books and dvds from Amazon and this is the first one that motivated me to actually post a review. It's so bad. I can not even comment on what the producer said, I could not hear anything about it. Staying away would be my advice, a total waste of money.""",0
"b""I like beautiful Asian films especially when Takeshi Kaneshiro is in one, but he is not in this movie! I did not see Aaron either. I would really like you to read the reviews before buying and I will do it from now on, just to make sure the characters listed are actually in the movie. Now who would have thought it was necessary? Obviously from the cover I realized that it would not be the main character that was fine with me, but I would have to understand that it is not the caliber of actor that is no longer on the cover. Is it possible that when they say that the film is Takeshi's, they mean that he produced it? I am so indifferent and bothered by their misleading information that I could almost scream. If they had not lied about the cast, I would not have bought it at all. It's obviously a pretty bad TV drama with lots of action, including wuxia actors, good-looking actors and a slightly confusing storyline. If it is a sequel, I suppose that explains some of the problems, because people appear and the main characters know them, but we have no idea who they are or whether they are bad or good even if we assume they should be friends or enemies or both depending on their actions. At one point, they are all together with a power ranger who forms a giant sword and I had no idea who they were or how Wind had come to work to help the villain. Also I had not realized that Wave was Cloud's brother (I think) until much later in history. It would have filled a lot more than an emotional punch if I had known from the beginning but maybe because I was so bored that it overcame me in some way! ? When the Wind becomes a demon there is no explanation as to how long or when it will change again or normal. It is with Mung, his wife a minute and then the next, she adopts a boy and then has not seen him until it is his cue to inadvertently warn that the master has a cold behind him. It's just an interweaving of scenes thrown together that leave you wondering how it's done / got this way and that. I would not recommend this film absolutely. It's filmed more like a soap opera, it has that kind of video and it's just changed horribly. I was bored waiting to see when Takeshi would have seemed to think that maybe it was the nameless, but I could not even figure out who the unnamed guy was. Maybe if they followed that, whoever wanted as the nameless, could have given her a little more than a punch. A perfect way to waste time.""",0
"b""The 1983 masterpiece by Lewis Gilbert, a sensitive and emotionally satisfying adaptation of the clever and perceptive play of two characters by Willy Russell. Gilbert and Russel would collaborate again for the wonderful & quot; Shirley Valentine, & quot; but their work in this film remains unparalleled. Michael Caine gives one of the most memorable performances of an illustrious career, disappearing in his Frank character, and Julie Walters is as magnificent as Rita / Susan. The music of David Hentschel is perfectly appropriate, Frank Watts' photography is inspired, the script is both touching and honest, but the magic of this film is in the interaction between the two main characters. This film takes the journey to self-awareness embodied in education, since the character Rita / Susan develops from the hairdresser to the student, intellectual, dilator, and finally in someone very different from the beginning of the film, yet still undeniably and uniquely & quot; Rita. & quot; The greatest gift a person can give to another is the love of learning, and so I feel that this is among the greatest love stories ever committed on celluloid. The ending could be & quot; inevitable as a tragedy, & quot; in the words of Willy Russel, but the relationship between Frank and Rita has made their emotional journey worthwhile, and we are all the richest on their journey.""",1
"b'If Daniel Barenboim is not the greatest living musician in the world, he is certainly the most versatile. In a career that has lasted more than 50 years, his name is linked to many of the famous recordings of opera, symphony, small ensemble and solo piano. With the last half of his career marked by a distinction on the podium, one can forget that he is still an expert concert pianist. Here we are treated with both talents as Barenboim directs the Staatskapelle of Berlin and plays all five Beethoven piano concertos. From the accompanying booklet we discover that Barenboim first recorded these works in 1967 at the age of 24 with Otto Klemperer. Now he is revisiting them 40 years later, on the occasion of his 65th birthday. The challenges of service as a conductor and soloist are undoubtedly considerable, but Barenboim, by performing it entirely by heart and without a score, makes it appear simple and natural. Although fully engaged in his solo role, Barenboim never loses the command of the orchestra. Sometimes his direction is in the momentary freedom of a large gesture of his left hand. At other times it is the subtlety of his gesture or the rapidity of his eyes. The Staatskapelle is perfectly in tune with these nuances and their way of playing is always at the right time and never hesitant. Among the many highlights: the wonderful exchange between piano and clarinet in the Largo of the first concert, an electrifying tale of the Rondo Vivace in the final movement of the fourth and all the beauty and majesty of the Emperor. The performance was recorded before a live audience during a three-day piano festival in Bochum, Germany, in 2007. The concerts were held in the Jahrhunderthalle, which presents an architectural project of a converted steel mill. The minimalist interiors with high ceilings and exposed steel beams give up the traditional elegance that adorns many concert halls (and the faux atmosphere that derives from it). Aesthetically, Jahrhunderthalle stands as a place that emphasizes above all comfort and clean lines of sight. The exhausted public is grateful and respectful of music. They are often in sight, but rarely heard (even between movements) until their applause at the end of each job. They are elegant (if not formally) people who know good classical music when they hear it. Some of the performances took place during the daylight hours, allowing the large rear windows to throw a wonderful natural light on the audience and on the artists who are further illuminated by soft lights for stages that highlight the musicians and their instruments where necessary and without shadows hard. The 1080i Blu-ray image is almost impeccable. The skin tones are natural and appealing. The color of the instruments and the clothing of the public is accurate without bleeding. The ivory keyboard is correctly exposed and balanced with a lot of resolution to see the distinction between the keys. The black levels are strong without losing any detail in the folds of the jacket of the musicians. The close-ups reveal the polished brass of the French horns and the fine grain of the bass and violins. Barenboim is appropriately the center of attention and we can see the delicate tufts of his hair and the beads of sweat that begin to shine on the forehead from the third movement of each concert. The PCM 2.0 audio track is clean, but the piano does not sound hard over the top C. On the contrary, the DTS HD-MA 5.1 track, opening the atmosphere of the rear channels and a wider stage, offers a beautiful, warm and spacious, devoid of any discrepancy in the upper register. The piano is centered correctly while the sound integrity of each orchestral instrument is presented with distinction based on its position on the stage. The complete program runs at around 3:20. There are no supplements except for a handful of trailers of other outputs of the Medicean Arts. An interview with Barenboim, some test footage and a brief history of the place would have been nice, but unfortunately missed opportunities. In the end, the only thing missing is, in any other way, a very welcome publication and another great result for one of the most distinguished artists of classical music.'",1
"b'In this DVD you have, the POPS orchestra in Boston with its really fantastic conductor, Keith Lockhart, Elmo and the band of Sesame Street, and the masterful piece of music ""Peter and the Wolf"".

"b'This is an unusual film Merchant / Ivory which focuses on the Indian community of Trinidad from about 1943 to 1954. It focuses particularly on a young teacher, who takes a wife, overcomes her cunning, greedy father, and lives in the countryside, only wishing to write books. However, he has to earn a living, so he becomes a masseur, who is not a masseuse, but rather a healer. He also writes books on Hinduism, which he publishes himself. Become known as the mystical masseur and develop a following at the national level. His book and those books that follow are quickly bought by a worshiping public now who venerate him as Pundit. He follows a brief career in politics, only for him to discover that an adoring public can become changeable. The film runs along, as does the life of this pundit. With a first-rate cinematography and stellar performances of the entire cast, this is a very good film, even if it is unusual. Those interested in other cultures will find this film of some interest. If you are not so inclined, deduct a star from my review.'",1
"b'I admit I have never seen Mario Bava film. I have just entered Italian cinema with the films of Dario Argento and other Giallo have taken my interest. Until now I had never tried any Bava. So, listening to this film and being intrigued by the premise, I took the DVD. The premise of the film is that four criminals rob a payroll of pharmaceutical companies during which the driver is killed. The three remaining killers flee to a parking lot taking hostages, one of whom kills to escape. Later, in order not to be detected by the police in a family car, these take out and take hostages more than once a middle-aged man and a sick child. At this point the films were a violent criminal film. When he enters the car, the film is basically focused on driving criminals and their hostages. What\'s good about the film despite minor flaws is that even in its form (neither Rabid Dogs or the re-edited Kidnapped was completed with the support of Bava due to circumstances that have earned his status ""lost"" until recently) it is really good to have assembled the suspense thriller slowly building its tension. As the car\'s tensions rise and the victims invoke life, criminals also begin to turn against each other. One wants to rape the woman hostage, while another goes on with what always happens while the leader is more interested only in reaching their destination. There are moments in the film that for me were great in a transgressive way in which the latest films could not even get close to the maximum. And in the end, I do not want to ruin it, but if I went into the plot, I would do it and I\'ll surprise you. I was totally shocked by the film. One thing is also the feeling of anger that filters through every frame. This is a brutal film to look at sometimes with its portrayl of a world that is vainly arrogant and rather brutal in considering the difficult situation of hostages (especially the child). For me it is a film that in tone could almost compare to one of my favorites, the Kurosawa Ran. Unfortunately I only saw the Rabid Dogs cut on the new Anchor Bay record. It also contains the assembly of Lamberto Bava Rapito more in line with the intentions of his fathers that I will watch in the future but that has been disabled for the synthesizer score (I love the harpsichord and the organ playing Rabid Dogs even if I have to admit that the score it\'s incesant) and I did not want to see the movie so soon after seeing it. However this is a definite advice from me, it is worth seeing it.'",1
"b'Being a great vampire / horror fan and a fan of Bloodrayne videogames, I decided to give this film a whirlwind. All I can say is ouch. Action scenes are ridiculous. The actors move in slow motion as if they had no coordination. I\'m guessing this is due to a low budget fight choreographer. And blood! This film must have the most beautiful blood I\'ve ever seen ... Tough I\'m giving this movie two stars for its violence over the top. Decapitations and the like are so exaggerated and ""fun"" that they seem beyond the comic. Think of Kill Bill multiplied 20 times ... All in all this is a good ""bad"" movie from start to finish. It is absolutely nothing in this that I would recommend.'",0
"b'As many reviewers say, this is definitely a carefree film, irresistibly fun and simply wonderful to watch. No sex, no violence, just a funny story about a salaried woman who finds dance as a key to getting rid of her bored existence. The soundtrack of the music was simply wonderful: each song corresponded perfectly to each scene. I was lucky to have managed to get a copy of the soundtrack during a trip abroad. In any case, I found the plot much more engaging and intelligent than your standard Hollywood movies. Rather than having Sugiyama fall in love with the original girl who attracted him to the ballroom, he discovers the sheer joy of dancing and its liberating power that brought him closer to his family by encouraging him to show his affection and love more directly. No cliches or well-used plots, just a good story.'",1
"b'Although it is true that the ""Soap"", a brilliant time, suffers from creative terminal problems in its fourth and final season (why Burt is suddenly the healthiest member of the family?), Today virtually every comedy aired with its audacious mix of comedy, drama, romance, suspense and pathos. The fourth season offers many memorable moments of TV, although less than the previous three seasons, including Burt\'s crisis of faith, El Puerco and the hilarious introduction to the family of his Juans, the touching and too late realization of Chester who loves Jessica, Dutch and Eunice\'s tacky wedding, and Mary\'s struggle to keep her sanity in the midst of true madness. Today No show approaches `` Soap \'\' also in this, its weakest season. What Sony did at the fourth season is terrifying and mysterious. While his presentations of Seasons 1 to 3 were technically irrelevant, largely due to such superficial materials, at least the episodes remained intact and were presented as they were originally on ABC and on the VHS version of the Columbia House series in the years 90. For some reason, Sony has decided to change the fourth season of ""Soap"" by cutting most of the pre-episode summaries (`` In the last episode of \'Soap\' .... ``), some of which were quite intelligent and none of which consumed more than 40 seconds of time. Worse, Sony has mounted the last five one-hour, ten-hour episodes, omitting whole scenes and essentially including heavily edited syndicated versions of the series. (I do not know if these are actually syndicated versions of these episodes, but they are significantly different than the episodes as they appeared on Columbia House tapes, which offered uncut episodes as they appeared on ABC in 1981.) Since Sony has Complete and complete versions of `` Soap \'\' Seasons 1-3, this shoddy and incomplete package of the fourth season is a puzzle, a disappointment and of value only for fans who just have to have the whole series on DVD. Otherwise, the true fans of the complete and unpublished series should keep - or find - the last year of ""Soap"" on VHS and suffer the inferior quality until Sony takes it off.'",0
"b""This film hardly touches the Holocaust. Some of the scenes from the holocaust were scenes from when people were released, not when they were taken to the camp, which made me think that the film was simply thrown together, capturing some scenes from YouTube.

It's more like a film about a woman who does not get along with her mother, she's popular on her radio talk show, and her marriage is in trouble. Then there are some things about a woman in Poland who left her diary to her daughter. It's not a good movie, no matter what tags you put on it because the acting is bad and the plot is worse.

An exchange between two hostages on trying to get in touch with the cameras during one of Idi Amin's visits. - All the scenes showing the release of non-Israeli hostages returning home.- A Catholic nun who insists on remaining with the rest of the hostages.

"b'Currently, this is the only version of Nobody\'s Fool available on DVD. The fact that you have a Paul Newman doubleheader at the same price as a single title is just a bonus. Nody\'s Fool is one of my favorite dramas and one of Newman\'s last big roles, like Sully\'s bad luck. The whole cast shines; this is probably the best job you\'ve ever seen from Melanie Griffith and Bruce Willis. To this is added Philip Seymour Hoffman, the last role of Philip Seymour and Jessica Tandy, winner of the Oscar, and you have a film not to be missed and a treasure to own. I like Richard Russo\'s books. I\'m a fan of Mohawk, Nobody\'s Fool and Empire Falls, Pulitzer Prize winner. The latter was translated into a HBO miniseries, Empire Falls, which also includes performances by Paul Newman and Philip Seymour Hoffman. However, Newman only won an Oscar, best actor for his role in The Color of Money in 1986. However, Newman emanates such a casual charm as Sully in Nobody\'s Fool that remains my favorite of the two.

The training is divided into 5 segments of 10 minutes which is a format that I love because it means you can shoot it down for a shorter workout and even if you do all the work it is not an eternity because of the segments change. The general idea is to do strengthening exercises followed by stretching to stretch the muscles. Segment overview: Weapons: this was probably my least favorite segment. I prefer the arm segment on 10 minute perfect pilates body solutions. They were about 6-7 minutes of arms and then 3-4 to stretch out their arms. It seemed rushed and the signal seemed a little off. Also, I did not find it very difficult. For this segment you need light weights. Peaks: this segment was excellent. They say you need a chair to do these exercises, but if you have strong thighs and a good balance is not necessary. These exercises make you feel your thighs, mine started to shake like crazy at some point and they are really effective. Glove: I think this was the most difficult segment of the DVD. I really like that they had a segment dedicated especially to the buttocks, a lot of videos through the thighs and I do not think they work very hard. In this segment your buttocks will work hard, and a chair is an absolute necessity. I had to take several breaks during this, but I can not wait to work up to the complete segment. Abs: I'm glad this segment was short because, although it was a good job for the abs, it was a bit boring. Put your feet on the wall and hold yourself in a sit-up position (do not think it sounds good?), But I do not try to do it for about 8 minutes) and then make variations from there. It is not my favorite but effective ab workout, I definitely felt my abs abdominals. Section: I really like it when DVDs have a specific long segment dedicated to stretching. With that said, this was not my favorite stretching segment. I wish the traits had been kept a little less long and there had been more different traits. It ended and I still felt the need to do some other trait to really feel strained. But the traits they did were good, and there's something to say to keep them that long and really make your body relax in the stretch. Overall, I highly recommend buying this video. It's a really effective workout and I definitely liked all the segments to keep them even if they were not my favorites. I also really liked that they had two instructors, a man and a woman, and showed simpler variations than many of the moves, including when it was better to rest if I needed it. One thing that I have not mentioned yet (and this is a matter of personal preference) is that education is the voiceover that is not my favorite and sometimes I felt like the cue was not correct. Final thought: for $ 15 it's worth it!""",1
"b'Every year as a child I could not wait to watch Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer during the holidays. In fact, I could not wait to see him on TV even as an adult! Wanting to share this great classic with my 7 year old son, I bought it for him a few weeks ago. Of course, I recorded it on a VHS along with other Christmas classics, but the quality was not exceptional and we had to endure advertising. The DVD version seems to be cleaned up by the TV version in terms of quality. I seem to remember more `` fuzzies\' \'when it was on TV (maybe the DVD was remastered?) Desinty\' s Child\'s claymation video is practically worthless, in my opinion, unless you have a little fan of this kind of music (and I do not). With a run time of 65 minutes, this DVD has practically no extras. Is there a lost scene that originally aired instead of the song `` Why Am I Such A Misfit? \'\' (an optimistic melody on how to hit and find your luck). You can also watch the DVD in Spanish, and my son likes to do it once in a while. The ""previews"" for the other DVDs - including an annoying promo for one by Peter Rabbit / Easter - looks like INFINITO. It\'s a shame how they advertise death on DVD for young people! And as for the story of Rudolph: well, it has always annoyed me that Rudolph\'s father rejected him for being different - just like Santa Claus himself! Very disappointing, but it\'s not like life - where people judge based on appearances? Anyway, I love the songs of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, and Hermie the dentist he wants to be, Yukon Cornelius and the Bumble bring to our home the warm nostalgia of the holidays. And my 7 year old son plays this DVD at least once a day! What more could you ask for ? (except maybe some fun extras).'",1
"b'After their first year of college, the band comes together to relax and have fun. After a party at Stiflers, which looks almost exactly like that of the first film, the gang decides to take their adventures to a beach house and spend the summer there. As they try to find work and organize beach parties, the kids have some of the dilemmas they need to deal with. Jim discovers that Nadia has returned to the United States after being released from them after their Internet debacle. Jim only had sex once and a half from that incident. So, to try and prepare for Nadia, she takes the help of Michelle, the geek band that shook her world a year ago. As she begins to teach him the ways of sexual behavior, they themselves begin to realize that perhaps they are more than they think they are for each other. Kevin, having separated from Vicky, must overcome his feelings for her once she comes home to have fun. Because for her they are just friends, that\'s why now she has a new boyfriend in her life. Oz has to deal with Heather since she left for the summer. But it does not help that his best friend Stifler is constantly trying to get him to have sex with any girl within a 3-yard radius of them. Speaking of Stifler, he is still facing the fact that Finch had sex with his mother last year. And Finch is having retreats from not being with Stifler\'s mother. For the longest time I thought the first part was the best of these 2. I seriously think I was wrong all this time. After watching these songs last night, I can tell you with all my heart that I laughed a lot more with the second part. The lines are better and even raunchier. Jim\'s embarrassments are hilarious (good god the scene of super glue). The girls are warmer. And Stifle maybe just a little exaggerated, but it\'s still much better in the second part. When he grabs that dildo and shakes it as he goes through that house, I can not stop laughing. And when he says he forgot where he found it, because of all the excitement of when he found out it was just hilarious. The lesbian scene was also a good laugh. In the end, I would have this one. Remember, though, if you do not like vulgar and raw comedies, you\'re just far away. ""There\'s no way a single straight man would get out of that house without doing something with Nadia. Simply no.'",1
"b""Alice Walker is a great pioneer. She is one of those African American women who deserves all our love and adoration. Explore in this film, and behind this in the book, the slow and progressive liberation of black women from their ancillary slavery. It must all start in their head. They have to find the courage to develop their personality and freedom in the closed prison of their skulls, and then, little by little, they find the strength and the power to resist men, and therefore to society, and therefore to excel. Liberation is a mental process that finds its total power when it becomes public and looks at society as the natural field of its realization. The film is touching, moving, sensitive, intelligent, sentimental and tremendously powerful, if not full of the most universal language we can imagine, the language of women's liberation seen as the first step towards the liberation of humanity. Alice Walker is universal in this story and takes care of the whole world and of every single human being. Moreover, no one is lost, no one is abandoned by the roadside, no one is wasted forever on the cause of liberation. Even the worst tyrant will find in his moral depth the idea and initiative that will free him along with others, along with those that he or she has assaulted for decades. The husband pays the immigration of the African husband and family of his wife's sister. And he does it for nothing, because he remains on the side and does not claim the due. Salvation is for everyone or it will not be. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris II and IX.""",1
"b'First of all, I have to come clean. I saw Full Metal Jacket for the first time in its original theatrical version. Of all that remained with me was the scene in the head that concludes the second third of the film. I bought it on the advice of my son, a newly appointed lieutenant in the Marines. Call FMJ the ""marine film"". \'\' He also calls the period of time `` a shameful chapter in the history of the Marine Corps. \'\' The habitual abuses of the recruits represented in the film do not happen anymore. Even so, the film is right on both fronts. Marine training, even thirty years later, is as challenging as Kubrick paints. It has the same objective: the creation of ""indestructible men (and now women)"" that can kill as many enemies as possible. The experience of marines in combat, especially in Vietnam, is as shown by the film. While undergoing training that will qualify him as a platoon commander, I asked my son about the incident leading to the second killing in cold blood. Could it have happened that the Marines would have lost so much to be at the mercy of a sniper? Absolutely, he replied, adding that the Marines consider the prospect of urban war with trepidation: ""There is an infinite number of places where the enemy could be."" Moreover, he said, Cowboy made the right call, even if he provoked the death of three Marines, even though I was on the street differently during Vietnam (and I could not see the fight anyway - I am blind in the right eye and right hand), I am convinced that Semper Fi is real. , make or die, gung ho, gung, ho, gung ho. ""The Marines are really the best we have, the inspiration for Army Rangers and Delta Force and Navy SEALS. They raised the bar in ways I did not appreciate. Run, do not walk, to see this movie.'",1

"b'No one can dunk a book in a gruesome and humid atmosphere like Neil Gaiman, soaked with humor and more than a little horror. Fortunately, that flavor is kept alive in the film adaptation of ""Coraline"", brought to life by the talented Henry Selick. It is a small, dark fairy tale full of ramshackle apartments, dancers mice and mysterious soulless doppelgangers, as well as a gritty heroine who finds herself in this unfortunate ""other"" world. Just transferred to an old apartment, Coraline (Dakota Fanning) is bored. Her parents are too busy to do something with her, and her neighbors are crazy or boring. The only exception is Wybie, a guy who annoys her endlessly. It is the kind of implacably boring world that any child would want to escape, until Coraline does not. Meet a plastered door and a colorful space tunnel, which leads to a doppelganger of the new house. In fact, it is so similar that it has an ""other mother"" with eyes closed (Teri Hatcher) and matches ""the other father"" (John Hodgman) as well as great food, games, a magical sparkling garden, a chorus of rodents circus and magic toys. First Coraline is fascinated by the other world, above all because her other parents are careful as her real ones are not. Then he finds his real parents locked in a mirror. With the help of a sarcastic cat, Coraline ventures into the other world. But with her parents and a trio of dead children held hostage, Coraline\'s only hope is to play with her freedom - and she will be forever trapped if she fails. Coral Gaiman\'s book ""Coraline"" is a brilliant fairytale dark atmosphere: decayed apartments, dead children, cobwebs, beetles, disincarnate hands, button eyes and an insect-eyed woman who wants to reclaim Coraline. It is a fairytale world that turns into a nightmare kingdom where souls are lost and horrible things sink into the shadows. Most of the filmmakers would turn the story into a sharp and unjust business ... but not the director of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" \'\' and `` James and the Giant Peach. \'\' Instead, Selick gives it a dark atmosphere, cobwebs, bright colors and surreal details (the button eclipses the moon). And it\'s full of delicious details that may have been stupid (the creeping claw hand), but they work brilliantly. The story begins as simply surreal, but becomes more horrible and disturbing as the film unfolds - and in the last third, the slow-motion story suddenly turns into a completely spectral territory, and a truly terrifying climax in which the other mother shows his true self. And along the way, there are a lot of wonderfully creepy moments - the three ghosts in a decaying bedroom / mirror, the supply of buttons and thread often, strange circus acts and much more. The horror is subtle, the delicious creepiness is not. Corinna - Alice in this Notsowonderland - is a wonderful little heroine: strong, sensitive, self-sufficient but still quite frightened by what is happening around her. Normally I\'m not crazy about Dakota Fanning, but only the voice is good enough in this role. The sarcastic cat is a magnificent counterpoint, and the original character of the movie Wybie is a nice companion (albeit a stranger). And the other mother is nightmarish - it\'s absolutely inhumane and ruthless, and from the point of view of the movie she became the substance of nightmares. Oh, and French and Saunders make a couple of funny cameos like the kooky neighbors. ""Coraline"" is a brilliantly dark little film, full of dark magic and mysterious creatures, certainly for Gaiman fans, dark fantasy and really gruesome things.'",1
"b'In my review of the Fallen album I mentioned Motorhead\'s Lemmy saying that the album was above and beyond the call of duty. The rest of the quote was that he felt they could not do it live. Well, I have to disagree with Mr. Kilminster having seen the ""World Domination"" tour on his Australian stop, I have to say the band sounded good. And this CD shows that they can actually fill the audio mix just like in their breakthrough album. This is actually a bit of a no frills thing in terms of audio. The sound is good, the band is tense, which is interesting considering the personal dramas of the time. It seems that the noise of the crowd has been gradual and eliminated, even if this is a fairly regular situation. The main difference between these Fallen songs and their live versions here is that the sound sounds like a hollower touch. Really this is a cash job on their fame. Putting out a live album when it\'s no longer in the catalog is a bit cheeky. It also serves to bridge the gap between their albums - the staff disturbances mentioned above have undoubtedly played their part. It\'s not like filling the time between albums with live releases and curiosity is a new idea (G\'n\'R is there anyone?). For fans of this band this is probably an essential listening. The songs sound good, the crowd is particularly adoring and they are a nice project. Three stars for the strength of the songs and because there seems to have been no mass overdubs. The fourth star for the extra DVD that the band shows has put in value. They also sold the DVD separately for a while. Make sure you have this version with the DVD already present as it is really worth it.'",1
"b""4.6 stars I love this film, and I think it's the screenplay that Ford does justice to the original TV series, rightly loved. I do not think this blu-ray transfer does much justice to the original print, though; while it's a good sharp image, it's not a big improvement over my DVD. The film itself is an excellent adaptation of the series, and Big Pharma's conspiracy angle is an excellent update that works well. There are chills in abundance, with minimal violence, which I appreciate most every year when the directors and idiot writers rely on guns and blood to fill the holes in their poorly planned plots. There's more intelligence than at work here, and director Andrew Davis does everything firmly and suspiciously. The ending is a bit weak: I do not buy the scene at the conference, but it works to the extent that it has to, and this is good enough. Add Ford and Jones to the top of their games and it's a movie worth watching many times, whenever you need to remember what a really good thriller can be. Unfortunately they have not polished it enough to be a blu-ray worthy of the description in high definition.""",1
"b'The problem with New Moon is that it takes itself too seriously while giving the public many reasons to consider it a joke. I try not to read too much in the movies, and I think people are responsible for their actions, but I agree that this film has influence on young girls and even older girls. Once I was in middle school, and a lot of dialogue resembled what I remembered hearing about boyfriends and girlfriends. You know, on the day when you had a big crush and they were the love of your life? Then 3 weeks later, BOTH go on to another ""love of your life."" That\'s how dialogue sounds, it\'s cheesy, exaggerated, and I\'m sorry for teenagers who think it\'s just what it should be. Bella have an obsessive and codependent relationship .. Downloaded by a vampire then you feel suicidal? Really? If you take out the vampire stuff, everything else is still wrong.Beautiful is mopey, without emotions, without humor, without networks, completely devoid of shell of a girl\'s personality It\'s really hard to understand why both of these guys find her attractive, what does she do for herself or someone she\'s a great resistance and she treats her father like shit It\'s not believable that two guys are willing to die (one again) for her, she offers nothing in return, she is discharged by Ed and eats only the attention that Jacob pays, without ever wanting to reciprocate his feelings, we call him leader. mas What I found particularly amusing is that he asks Jacob if he could stop being a wolf ... yet this same girl would never ask him to Edward. It does not make sense . Lautner did the best acting of the three and made me feel for Jake. I read the Wiki page for the book by Breaking Dawn and the result for his character seems like a movie recipe for disaster. At this point, the producers have to stop driving the girls. He honestly saved the film. As an adult, I can only endure so much anguish and the fact that he broke a few smiles prevented me from extinguishing him. When the werewolf first emerged from the woods before chasing Victoria, OK yes, I thought it was a bear. But even so, the werewolf scenes were the best parts. The vampire\'s makeup was terrible and the contacts were distracting. Pattinson was better in the first movie. Stewart was the same non-entity. It was so unreliable. Although not in dialogue, mannerisms, facial expressions and actions can convey a lot on a character. It is hard to believe that Bella is not a robot. Even on the DVD cover, she does not try. Compared to both male contacts. Actors should be able to sell the motivations of their characters. Stanley in ""Streetcar"" was totally reprehensible, but Brando sold it. Stewart does not, so Bella looks like one of the most undeserving ""heroines"" that has ever hit the screen. Ah, I\'m about to stop here.'",0
"b'Good films on the & quot; Great War "" (as the First World War was known before there was a second) are few and far between. After & quot; All quiet on the western front & quot; and & quot; Paths of Glory & quot; the list is quite short. This film does not live up to these standards, but it is still an excellent film. In general terms, the film is quite accurate in terms of the representation of the fighting of the First World War. Battle scenes approach ""& quot; Saving Private Ryan "" level of realism you can get on commercial television. Keep in mind that some scenes, especially the & quot; friendly fire & quot; artillery attack, they are not for the picky. The supporting cast is a collection of colorful and original characters, lacking most of the usual war movie clich\xc3\xa9s. You could not watch a character and say if he would die at the end of the movie. It was easy to imagine that these characters had been ripped off a street in New York around 1918. Rick Schroeder offers a first-rate performance as the great and deeply conflicted Whittlesey, torn between his duty and the well-being of his men. There are some moments where the film hits a false note. Whittlesey\'s car was probably not initially built for 15 years after the end of the Great War. The scene in which the major receives his orders seems to ignore the military protocol. And in a big problem of continuity, Whittlesey\'s executive office talks about the barred artillery shooting that happened that day, when it happened the day before. These are just small holes in an otherwise first-rate effort.'",1
"b""Yes, Keanu Reeves actually plays the villain in this wonderful magical film of romance, jealousy, romance, betrayal and honor set in Renaissance Italy.

The cast includes many big names from both sides of the Atlantic such as Denzel Washington, Emma Thompson and Michael Keaton, and the heroine is the first big release for Kate Beckinsale. The dialogue in the film remains true to the original game and the setting is probably as close as possible to what Shakespeare imagined. The best thing is the music; of classic style but original in the composition. I enjoyed watching this film over and over and you too will.""",1
"b'This DVD has my favorite soundtrack for this movie, however, it is not synchronized with the video! (which basically ruins it) Even the chapter selection is faulty: there are only 4 selections of chapters to choose from; chapter 2 is labeled chapter 1, and so on ... so there is no selection for chapter 1. The title menu is also extremely cheap, showing a small picture of the cover of the DVD case on a background similar to the old one background image of blue sky with clouds. Last, and certainly not least, the quality of the video is terrible. This is probably not worth getting unless you are planning to remaster the DVD with the soundtrack in sync with the video for personal use and with a decent chapter selection menu. I hope to find out that someone has already put a good version together with this soundtrack on DVD (I know it exists on VHS).'",0
"b""These days Uwe Boll has become a kind of joke among fans of the genre. With titles such as Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead in his resume, the German director has become synonymous with hack work crapfests. The hallmarks of the weaker horror genre may be. I suppose it's a little insensitive that we so much appreciate Boll's pursuit, but if the man has not tried so energetically to justify and defend his work in interviews, I'd be much more willing to leave him speechless. It's one thing to make a terrible movie and defend it through a delirious assumption that is somehow good, but another to try to cover you when you know you're messing up. I wait patiently for the half defenses of Ugo from Bloodrayne. As in all these video game-based and half-baked sluts, the plot is irrelevant. This does not mean that a story of descent can not have been produced on the character of Rayne, but it certainly fell in the face. The screenplay is the first culprit. It comes out as something I wrote in the tenth grade English class. Every imaginable cliche is on display. It's as if screenwriter Guinevere Turner had an encyclopedia of trivia. I suppose the excuse could be that she's new to this kind of piece, but come on. The world is non-descriptive and full of incongruent things with its old world environment. But despite the aforementioned anachronisms, dialogue is nothing but rigid, old-fashioned, which speaks of a funny aversion to contractions in sentences. The various plot machinations that provide the impulse for the actions of the characters remain always vague and irrelevant. There's only so little here for the actors to work with. Not that they are trying to do it. Nobody here seemed to give shit, which is understandable. There is humor in the clumsy and stilted portraits of many actors. It seemed almost that some of them (Michael Madsen and Michele Rodriquez, of course) were reading for the first time the dialogue box with the cards of the cues. Udo Kier and Billy Zane have useless rolls, (though Zane manages to give up on some of his particular extravagant qualities). Basically, Ben Kingsley sits in the same chair for three quarters of the film, barely reacting to anything anyone is told. And Meatloaf, well ... I find myself a little disused by its short sequence in the film. All I will say is that it was a wig hell. Let's see ... was there something good? I will say that Kristanna Loken is definitely hot. It's hard to say if he can act because there is not a dialogue worth acting and no director can push it to a performance, but it seems I would imagine Rayne. The gore, particularly in the Unrated version, is quite vivid, though a bit clumsy and unconvincing. There's a big troll..he never really explained ... e..ah..ah, hell, I just wish someone could give Uwe Boll some career advice. Maybe he could be a choreographer of fight scenes, he likes them, or he might try to be a Production Assistant, get back to the top, learn how to make a movie. Heck, he could be a garbage collector for what I care, someone just told him to stop making films. In this way, all of humanity could benefit from it.""",0

"b'Forbidden Planet is perhaps the pre-eminent work of science fiction in the 1950s. It is nowhere near the imagination of science, but it is a thoughtful and intelligent offering in its own way. Famous (but very vaguely) based on Shakespeare\'s ""Tempest"", this is a movie where there are so many potential levels of meaning you want to find. With Morbius interpreted as Prospero, and Prospero in turn most likely based on the Elizabethan magician Dr. John Dee, co-creator of Enochian magical language, is it really a coincidence that Morbius himself is a linguist? There is much more that I would like to say here, but I am holding back for the good of those who are not already familiar with the film. I do not want to give spoilers. For those who have seen the film and feel inclined to such exercises, I simply ask him: who - or what - would you assign the respective roles of Ariel and Caliban? How would you respond to your answers with the broader themes of the film? And what do your answers suggest about how matter and spirit were conceived in the minds of the Elizabethans and Americans of the 1950s, respectively? Just something to think about. For those who have not yet seen the Forbidden Planet, I would say first of all that it is a wonderful film that works perfectly at the level of a simple adventure that could have a 10-year-old child. As a piece of science fiction, I would just like to emphasize that the depths you will find are of philosophy rather than of science; even if the classic technological themes of the science fiction of the 50s take place in a metaphorical form. Fortunately, however, the reds under the metaphor of the bed and subtitles in the sky have become a similar clich\xc3\xa9; much of the science fiction of the day is nowhere to be found. One thing I want to add before going further is that this film deserves to be seen only for the set design alone. Whether you consider it classic or dated depends on you; but for me I will simply say that I have never seen the visual lexicon of science fiction of the 50s expressed more completely. Okay: so much for the movie. What about the DVD? Well, I\'m happy to say it\'s great! The quality of the images is beautiful and there are some extra LOADS and also some good ones. We receive a lot of promotional material from the period, including deep behind the scenes and even an extra children\'s film that also used Robbie the Robot as support. Incidentally, since I saw some reviews that I wrote appear for editions or versions other than the one for which I originally wrote them, I would like to point out that I am writing this on Forbidden Planet (Two-Disc Special Edition). As a reviewer, you\'ll see that I\'m not one of those reviewers who distributes five-star raves like candy. But if you have any interest in classical science fiction, this is a film you MUST see. And if you\'re looking for the best DVD possible, as far as I know, it is.'",1

I want to give an extra inch to the audio part of the Blu Ray - turn up the volume when you watch this because the quality is really amazing. Very realistic, nothing exaggerated.

""He has to kill that terrorist at all costs"". It is still not enough. It hits him with bullets, destroying the overpass even more.

It almost seems like they hit this copy from a print of a mutated 16mm projector. The printout has an incorrect damage to the pinion which causes the image to shake on the screen. It seems they used the light bulb from a simple oven to cook this print. Calling the muddy picture would be a compliment. All life and color have been sucked into this film. I said the film was not even focused. Even the sound was pretty bad, but I'm not much of an audiophile to really talk about it. Do yourself a favor and look for the VHS version.

"b""Donald O'Connor plays Aladdin both as a hero and as comic relief in this fantasy of Arabian nights. Apparently American in a cast that seems largely European, O'Connor's Aladdin is of humble origins but never allows his lack of means (or concrete ideas to acquire) to dampen his dreams of greatness. When he discovers that his new lamp contains a genius that will grant him three wishes, his possibility of greatness could finally become a reality. Nobody believes him, less than ever the adorable Djalma, who has spent years waiting for him to abandon his dreams, settle down and marry her. Savored by his deepest desires, Aladino goes to Basra, a large neighboring city, which already celebrates the imminent marriage of the Sultan's daughter with the young but wise Molook.

When he makes a mistake in the plan, Aladdin rides in an unlikely rescue with the help of the nosy prince and the population of Fakir and beggars of Basorah. This was a funny film and for some reason overlooked. It's okay for kids, not really violent (except for two scenes, both involving a doll made to look like a real and exotically beautiful woman, and designed to crush those who creep in her embrace to death) and manages to look both very Hollywood and also very convincingly Arabic at the same time.

I just had the opportunity to buy the DVD and watch this movie just for the second time, and it was just as good and intense as I remember from that first time! \'\' The Defiant Ones \'\' the legendary Tony Curtis and the equally legendary and talented Sidney Poitier as condemned John `` Joker \'\' Jackson and Noah Cullen who, following a physical fight triggered by raids between them, partly contribute to the car accident in which involved in the transport vehicle.The resulting incident gives these two chained prisoners the opportunity to escape on foot, but this is in the southern United States of the 1960s, so when incoming law enforcement officers are responsible for tracing the Prisoners discover that the two coined together are of different racial extractions and become somewhat negligent in their search, mistakenly supposing that the two fugitives would most likely kill each other out of racial hatred before they even got five miles. Forced to work together despite the racial tensions between them, Joker and Noah do not face the situation lightly and are constantly on the move to stay as far forward as possible to their pursuers. In the days that follow both men form something of an uneasy camaraderie, and conversations that creep between them seem to actually help to blur some of those racial tensions that exhibit each other, to where every man gains a certain respect for each other. Joker is also forced to face some unpleasant realities, like being forced to admit in his heart that Noah is the most rational of the two and, above all, having to deal with the fact that his white skin is not a safety net when he is a criminal escaped on the run. There is also a history of ""human interest"" in the subplot of the film, some of which are a little ahead of its time: the county sheriff becomes the catalyst that prevents the hunt from becoming a messy and messy ""Good Ol"" Boy "" ""guns, dawgs and testosterone parties, and one of the citizens, played by the legendary Lon Chaney Jr., prevents citizens of a city from becoming an emotionally irrational lynching. Cinematography is excellent for a film of its time, although some sets may have been built and arranged better (for example, there is a set in which the lights of the city of Los Angeles shine in the background beyond the studio lot). It is also nice to hear actors speaking with southern accents that do not sound like ""Foghorn Leghorn"" waste. Considering also ""remaking"" this classic film would not only be a terrible mistake, but it would also be a virtual impossibility ... so I hope that nobody in Hollyweird, or anywhere else, can ever think of doing this one thing, and then leave that this great piece of film history stands alone and continues to stand the test of time. * * *'",1
"b'Unless you can laugh with Horror, you\'re a big fan of Louis Gossett Jr., or you\'re a fan of Richard Karn (""Home Improvement""), you probably will not like this film at all. It drags at a slower pace than a slug snail. Dialogue is really, really, bad. This is one of those movies that you know the only reason actors, directors, producers and anyone else associated with the movie was because of the money. Richard Karn offers some laughter as an oscillator, single, archaeologist and LG Jr is a little scary at times (not because of his character, but because of his over-emulation). However, most of the time everyone in the movie has these & quot; how I ended up here & quot; or & quot; I can not wait until I\'m done with this & quot; look on their faces. By the way, I said that there is not a lot of plot up to half the film? What makes this film worse is that it actually portrays itself as a serious fearful film. Give me a break ! Roger Corman knew he was doing schlock and Ed Wood really believed he was making good films. The producers of this film can not invoke both cases. All in all, do not waste time with this movie, rent some more movies about mom.'",0

"b'I agree with everyone that the studios are once again tearing us apart. TV movies MUST be made available to all fans who have already purchased the individual seasons. I think fans would even accept TV movies as a ""disk only"" offer (without packaging) at a reasonable price ... for those who contact the studio. Compared to the ""whole series"" caskets; I think it\'s a good idea, but NOT an idea that really works at the moment. My main complaint is the amount of discs and non-standard boxes (LARGE) used for most of the series. Sure, it\'s nice in the store and online, but it definitely does not fit well on a shelf with the rest of your DVD collection. Try putting a couple of ""complete set"" boxes on a shelf and see how fast it starts to look ridiculous! I prefer to buy single seasons, which fit well on a shelf (with the rest of my collection) and we usually have a better packaging. Remember that some of the ""whole season"" boxes have superimposed disks (loose) or simply slip into small cardboard notches (which scratch the disks). The real answer for the sets for the whole season will be the greater capacity of the BLU-RAY format. Less discs, more beautiful box (standard size), etc. Until then, I\'m going to buy the seasons individually. JM'",0

As soon as the initial narration began, I could see that there was a problem. I hope Henstooth's video is examining this and will offer an exchange of records. Other than this guilty pleasure of cheese fest 80 has never been better. They did a great job, just solve this audio problem. Ace Hunter should not sound like Alvin.""",0
"b'There are some movies in Hollywood where self-awareness is so obvious, you can pretty much see what\'s going on in the heads of the filmmakers.

Imagine killing an African-American technical chief and make a comment on the drug smuggling smoke, no one would support him, I know I would not, all I\'m saying is, if you\'re going to face all those problems to make a nice rainbow through the cast, why not rain on the parade by not making a few extra steps? After that, I discovered that it took an increasing effort to suspend my imagination, implicitly knowing that the film would follow a rigorous script that would plagiarize to appease the expectations of the old men who frequent Thailand, as you know ... computer programmers There would be no more surprises, since all the CGI fantasy thrown on me seemed like something I I\'ve seen and heard before. The film is about a previous generation, with sneakernet technology (McClane to young computer wiz: ""We\'ll do something (to cross the city) who invented in the \'60s: jogging"") can still stand comparison with the smug and touching new generation of keyboards, so it needs to entertain by showing the gray generation that their language and physical brand are still valid, I was cheering for the older, more physical generation, me, but really Hollywood. More than twenty years have passed since the Year of the Dragon, a tender, talented hero whose most passionate moment in a film is when he turns into Stanley White by Mickey Rourke that looks like a dinosaur, and we all know what happened to the dinosaurs.'",0

"b'I am very disappointed with this film. Mainly because it seems that he is talking about two different subjects at the same time. On the one hand, the film interviews some experts in the field of philosophy and theology, who follow the history and progression of postmodern thought quite effectively. On the other hand, there are the two filmmakers who simply discuss their useless and sometimes irrelevant to the ideas of discussion. The Williamson brothers are asking questions that have little to do with postmodernism and more to do with their personal dissatisfaction with the church. It is as if they had made this film to throw out their ideas and advertised as a film on postmodernism. While some interviews with experts are useful for clarifying trends in post-modern thinking, this video as a whole is useless as a whole.'",0
"b'The Bride With White Hair 2 quickly followed the success of the original film, resuming the tragic story of Cho Yi-Hang (Leslie Cheung) and her forbidden love Lien Ni-Chang (Brigitte Lin). Betraying his sacred oath that he would never doubt his beloved, Cho has unleashed a monster. Ni-Chang\'s fury over Cho\'s treachery makes her completely mad, turning her into a white-haired witch who lives only to destroy every living member of the Eight Clans, especially the Wu Tang clan to which Cho belongs. As for Cho, he retired to Mount Shin Fung, guarding a mystical flower whose bloom (and which blooms only once every twenty years) can purify and restore the woman he still loves. It\'s been ten years since the deadly night that Ni- Chang went mad and almost alone destroyed the Wu Tang clan. Only two members of the clan survive: Cho, who has been on guard at Mount Shin Fung in blizzard conditions all these years, and Cho Kit\'s nephew (Sunny Chan). With Kit\'s upcoming marriage to Lyre (Joey Maan), the opportunity to promote the bloodline exists - and so it is that Ni-Chang drops the party, kidnaps the young bride and brings her back to her private castle full of men - deadly and deadly women. There, Lyre is indoctrinated in the philosophy of the witch ""Watch a man, kill a man"" and programmed to kill Kit with his own hands. The Eight Clans send their best warriors to try to kill the witch and save Lira, but they are almost defenseless against Ni-Chang, who uses his deadly hair as a more effective weapon (it seems strange, I know, but it really works good). It soon becomes clear that the only person who might be able to defeat the white witch is Cho Yi-Hang, and this sets the stage for an unforgettable meeting between the two former lovers. This sequel is a film more direct and action-oriented than the original The bride with white hair, and for this reason I actually found it more pleasant on the surface. However, the depth and beauty of the original is lacking, largely because the two lovers do not meet face to face again until the final scene - even if this encounter deserves the wait. Surely if you have seen and appreciated the original, you will want to try this sequel.'",1

"b""I could not wait to see the animated Disney Dinosaur. After all, it would have been reportedly eight years and millions [s] in processing. I do not know exactly what I expected. I thought the recent explosion of computer graphics technology would produce a corresponding success in the narrative of the film? If so, I must have been naive, for what the powers that Disney decided to do was take this dazzling technology and graft it onto a story that is simply a remake of those used in some of their past successes. The dinosaur shows that playing on the safe side is not always the best way to go. The opening is spectacular. A herd of dinosaurs is grazing peacefully. We see a mother watching over a nest of eggs. Suddenly, a huge carnasour emerges from the woods looking for dinner. In the ensuing chaos, only one egg survives. What follows is a spectacular series of events in which this egg is transported to a distant island populated by mammals rather than dinosaurs. A family of lemurs finds the egg, and it is here that the film begins to disintegrate. Lemurs start talking, and this is the first time words are used in the film. I did not expect Disney to make a film so profoundly different that none of the characters spoke, but I was surprised to find out that they had been extracted directly from The Lion King and Tarzan. It is as if the jungle of Africa was primitive as it happens at Disney World, as if the things that could have been millions of years ago went beyond all imagination. I can not stress enough how good it is to watch this movie. It shows us that CGI technology continues to advance at breathtaking speed. The camera flies through beautiful landscapes, dinosaurs are fanatical to watch and the colors are wonderful. One particular scene, in which the world of dinosaurs is almost destroyed by a spectacular meteor shower, is among the best animated sequences ever produced. As for the story, I wonder how many of Disney's nitpicks actually have children of their own. One wonders if they make decisions based on the children they see around them or on the basis of the focus groups. It has never happened to them that everything that fascinates children is not necessarily cute and cuddly or, for that matter, even safe. For example, when I was a child, I fell in love with the ocean, not because I thought it was warm and safe, but for deeper reasons than I could express. I'm not sure how today's children think they were dinosaurs, but I doubt they see them as big old puppies or as creatures with Judeo-Christian ethics. In this film, the dinosaur that the lemurs save grows to be one that teaches their fellow men that survival of the fittest is wrong and that helping your dinosaur buddies is what it is all about. In some ways, I do not think the average child will buy his argument, not when it comes to creatures in the wild. I think they will find his preach a bit boring. Assuming that children take everything and translate it into a fantasy world, Disney has underestimated the intelligence of its young audience and has shown that it may have become a bit out of its target market, at least when it comes to this particular topic. .""",0

"b""First of all, you can not watch this DVD if you're sort of weird-politically correct. Every stereotype, from the metal heads, the religious father and the professor of gender studies, is reinforced and ruthlessly beaten with brutal sarcasm. So, if you could be offended by this, DO NOT WATCH! ! ! Here, now if you can take things with a pinch of salt, and you like the extremely ruthless comedy, then Dirtbags is the movie for you! Get a group of burns from metalheads, each of whom tries to achieve a specific goal in life (usually involves getting sexual favors from women), and getting involved in extravagant situations from which there is usually no escape, just a further dive into absolute degeneration. I'm sure there's a kind of thesis in this for all you college guys out there ... maybe you can never reach your goals through dishonest means? Ah, I do not think so. It probably does not make sense, but it does not matter! And you must love the characters, who are all so colorful and strange that no fiction could ever make them completely. These are real images out of life ... I've actually seen male professors and Ogre-gym professors, so this is stranger than fiction. As I said, this film is politically incorrect. No, I take it back; it is anti-political correctness. It is good to see that someone has gone to extremes and has completely made fun of political correctness, exposing it to the absurdity it was brought to. If there is no other quality of saving this film in the eyes of the general public, at least it is the social criticism that makes South Park as tame as Sesame Street. Random graphics generated by the computer (the skeleton during the pizza man breaks loose on campus, the bee flying in the can, the chick drowning continuously in the river) adds a touch of whimsy to the films of series B and witnesses the genius of homemade films. Personally I find these great things. The scenes of casual nudity are, according to my humble opinion, more by pure chance than by drooling with pleasure on the part of the spectator. Why is there a scene of a naked woman for several minutes? Because it's random and so absolutely stupid that it gets pretty funny. I must, however, suppress a star for two reasons: one, the fact that this DVD has no chapter selections (you can only watch the movie all the way), and two, the sound. With the sound, there is always the music that plays, sometimes this overpowers the dialogue (extremely annoying!), And because of the low budget, some of the dialogues are not recorded with expertise, so it is still low in the mix. I looked at the first one, I did not understand it, but when I looked at it a second time, I was falling hysterically. In a cameo by Peter Steele of Type O Negative, a fantastic soundtrack that includes Immolation, Candlemass and a smattering of various goofy songs, and you're ready for a real surprise! ... I mean, if you're not afraid of NOT taking it seriously.""",1

I really thought they could do it when they were doing the song, ""Step in Time"", which had a really perfect energy, and there were no accidents, which really impressed me! I was also struck by the fact that when the Tates were swept away by a strong wind, and Mary Poppins flew to and from Banks\' house, or from all of Uncle Albert\'s filming, or all the scenes they fly in, YOU CAN NOT see a SINGLE thread!

"b'I was really disappointed with Sneiders Perfect Rebounding Workout. I bought it because I wanted an alternative to the DVDs of the Urban Rebound compilation. The first sign of trouble was in the initial interview on the tape, which showed the host, presumably Dr. Sneider, with a giant belly. This is not the model I was looking for. To be honest, if you do the training on this video, you will get a good general workout. But the video is so repetitive, completely devoid of enthusiasm, decidedly boring and produced in a non-professional way. For the bouncy part, it does the same very few movements, not very fancy, over and over again. When switching from one movement to another, the camera is almost never focused on the teacher\'s feet to see what he is doing, so you can only guess. The ""class"" consists of a group of people totally out of shape and with rhythmic problems on the front lawn of the Royal Hawaiian hotel. They do not practice at all in unison and the camera is usually on them, not on the teacher. It is necessary to have hand weights to run the program. For the abs part of the program, during most of it the cameraman forgot to focus on the camera. The two people are just blurry. Also, there\'s really no point in doing the abs or the yoga or pilates moves on a rebounder. It\'s definitely uncomfortable to do it, and you can get a much better workout by doing it on a mat, without hurting yourself on the hard rebounder frame. While the exercises in the abs and yoga parts were good, I highly recommend getting a non-bouncy different DVD, such as Candlelight Yoga (very excellent) with Sara Ivanhoe. This has many of the same moves of the yoga part of this workout, but safe, well-taught, professionally photographed and, above all, ENTHUSIASM. This was just a very, very boring, repetitive exercise video. Urban Rebounding compilations are not perfect, but they are MUCH better.'",0

"b'An amazing film made in almost impossible circumstances. Set in Paris in the \'40s of the last century in a district of lower-class theaters (the ""Boulevard of Crime""), the main plot speaks of a mime (played by Jean-Louis Barrault) who falls in love with ""an expert woman ""\'\' - interpreted brilliantly by Arletty. In an incredibly moving and delicate scene, Arletty only asks Barrault to make love with her, but does not grasp the moment and leaves her. Find lust in the arms of others. Other important characters include a degenerate philosopher / writer; a Shakespearean actor; a rich count who ""keeps"" Arletty; and the woman who loves Barrault and eventually marries him. But the love between Barrault and Arletty remains true for all the years, although in the end, after having spent a glorious night together, she leaves him forever. The acting is superb everywhere, even if what makes the film a masterpiece is the screenplay by Jacques Prevert: dialogue is simply brilliant. The film was shot during the Nazi occupation and many actors left the set to go fight in the resistance. The sets were constantly moved to avoid Nazi bombing and interference when possible. The film has a duration of c.190 minutes; the Nazis had a law that no film could exceed 90 minutes, so it was created as TWO independent films. The film is not only a testimony of love in all its passionate intensity (after all it is a French film), but also concerns the survival of a country and a big city, Paris - an entire civilization, in reality - that suffers under the rudder of a ferocious oppressor: it is the light of love, of culture and of memory that shines more and more vividly from the darkness of hell.

"b'I practice yoga regularly for about a year. I am familiar with the flow of Vinyasa and Hatha yoga, and I enjoy both. Unfortunately, Sybel\'s Yoga was a disappointment. I kept thinking she did not know what kind of yoga she was doing: it was a focused pose like Hatha, but the pace was extremely fast (faster than most of Vinyasa I had) and there was really no flow to the movements. He jumped directly into poses without any focus of the breath in advance, and instead of doing some movement to warm up the body, he started with stretching poses. This confusing pattern continued throughout the DVD as she passed between apparently random strength, stretching and relaxation. Each pose was held for only 2-3 seconds before moving on, and the reminders of ""inhaling, exhaling"" were too fast for a good breath of soothing yoga. Although Sybel mentions in the opening that his yoga is for people at any level of fitness, many of the poses included in this DVD are too advanced for beginners and would need many changes for someone not at the height of physical fitness.'",0

The quality is disgusting. If you put it on a computer and check its size, it's only 3.7 GB, not even an entire 8 GB DVD, so they went cheap and used a single layer DVD. You can say it when you play it because it's an interlaced DVD, the Google interlaced DVD for more information. Basically this is for playing on OLD TV not the current ones of HDTV. It also seems that they used an old VHS for ripping instead of using original sources or even a LaserDisc, those huge record DVD discs, they had a much higher quality of VHS and did not deteriorate over time like VHS does. If torn from one of those it would be much better. Also it did not take much time to create menus, when you go to watch trailers and change language it's a very boring blue menu and no audio. I could have done a better job with free software in the menus. Also, the records were made in Mexico, they could not even show off enough to have the made in USA. I'm glad that now it's on DVD but for something I've been waiting so long I'm angry that it's so low quality I can raise the quality a bit 'tearing and running a decomb filter to eliminate the plot, but why the heck could not have just put out a superior quality product? I also know some people with LaserDisc readers, I could just buy the LaserDisc of this and get them ripped for me, burn it to DVD and put it in this case. The case is nice and looks good with my other DVDs and Blurays.""",0
"b'Choose another version at all costs! My wife wanted this film since she loved the first one so much. He had read somewhere that this version was very good and could not have been more wrong. The transfer is horribly faded. Needless to say, we will never buy a version of SYNERGY again. I would like to be able to give it 0 stars. Unfortunately, a good movie has been ruined by such a disgusting DVD. UGH!'",0
"b'I got this video with the knowledge that it will provide me with the basics of yoga and that I will become progressively better at yoga and more comfortable to practice it. The video provides a series of explanations on the screen of basic yoga positions with a small graphic. It is very difficult to read on the screen, the color is too light and helps very little. The video is very good for those who have practiced yoga for a while and have a good understanding of it. I tried all the programs contained in the video, without being able to follow the movements and very little knowledge of how to do it. I had to buy a basic yoga book to understand the positions of yoga in detail. The DVD is now sitting on the shelf. I do not recommend this DVD for beginners. This is a more advanced video.'",0
"b'For the outline of the plot, here\'s how we read the back of the DVD: ""Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) is a private investigator specializing in unexplained supernatural phenomena: his cases go into the dark corners of the world, in search of truth in the hidden remains of the ancient civilizations Now, the greatest mystery of his past is about to become the most dangerous case he has ever faced - with the help of his ex-girlfriend, the archaeologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid) and her bitter rival, the government agent Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff), Edward is about to learn that just because you do not believe in something he does not believe I mean he can not kill you! ""According to the character of Carnby, the fear of darkness is what keeps us in life. Unfortunately, however, the fear of bad movies does not prevent us from renting them. Despite the horrible reviews, I decided to give in to the temptation to rent Alone In The Dark (I had a free rental, so I thought there was not much to lose). It was even worse than I expected ... First, the creatures that are unleashed from the depths of darkness - or whatever the holes in clich\xc3\xa9d horses are shoveled in history - are pathetic Dino della CGI beasts. Something interesting, scary or even simply ""cool"" about them? No . Only monsters generated by useless computers that fail to entertain the public in the slightest way. For two, acting is horrendous. Seeing Tara Reid on the DVD\'s headlines made me roll my eyes, but seeing her attempt to act as an archaeologist in a sci-fi action movie made me laugh. The only half-way recitation is given by Christian Slater, but it\'s still not enough to cover the rest. And for three, the film is terribly boring, with few action scenes. Oh sure, some unknown shots here and there, some flashing creatures on the screen, and a small gore is included. But real action? Very little . The small amount of action he has included is the reason I gave this two-star stinker. I hate to see a movie suffer, but it deserves it. In conclusion, do not make the same mistakes that most of these reviewers made by renting the film, knowing how terrible it must be. Just trust the ratings on this. It will save you money and time.'",0
"b'In 1879 a British column was almost annihilated by a large ""impi"" of Zulu warriors near Isandhlwana. Later, a small British force encamped in nearby Rorke\'s Drift (a trading and mission station) consisting of 104 fit soldiers and a number of disabled people in a makeshift hospital became the next target. For two days the station was attacked by waves of Zulu warriors. The total number of attackers was around 4500. In the end, nearly 400 Zulu were killed in comparison to only about 20 of the defenders, the hospital was burnt to the ground and 11 Victoria Crosses were assigned to the survivors. The film itself is a reasonably faithful re-creation of the events at Rorke\'s Drift, with good acting by Michael Caine, Stanley Baker and a great cast of Zulus support. The ferocity of the assault, the stubborn and desperate defense by the small garrison and the chaos of hand-to-hand combat on the barricades can all be perceived through cinematography. A wonderful aspect of this film is that the battle scenes were shot using a huge number of actors in the role of Zulu warriors, who were obviously able to recreate the tactics and movement of the royal army of 1879. Their cries of war, the synchronized movements of clashes with the spear against the shield and progress in formation create the sense of a real army that moves to attack the apparently condemned garrison. This is one of the very few films that gives the viewer the sense of how the fight must have been in the days before the appearance of mechanized armies on the scene.'",1

"b""my wife and I enjoyed the series and we intend to get the rest of the episodes. People are real, funny stories and beautiful scenery. we heard about it from my cousin, and on a recent trip to Ireland, we visited the village where it was filmed. it's just like in the movie. We recommend it.""",1
"b""That's what you expect from the guys at Monty Python. It's silly, irreverent and absolutely weird. Erik the Viking is a dark-hearted light comedy, and while it seems strange, those of you who have seen Monty Python and the Holy Grail or The Life of Brian will understand. This will never be called a masterpiece of cinematography, acting or special effects. So again it is not done for. The film does exactly what it is intended to do. The charm of the film is based on the execution of some rather stupid situations. From the Vikings flying from the ends of the Earth to Erik they fight a multitude of enemies thinking they are invisible. The special effect hardly equals that of other Python films made in the '70s, and this was done in 1989. The performances of the cast of Monty Python are not the best, but they are fun and satisfying. The fact is nothing that is really important. Erik the Viking is a good and entertaining story with some thoughtful and meticulous reflections on the human condition and religion. Even the dark stuff ends up not being so ruined. This DVD is really hard to find, and to make matters worse Sony has put together a Director's Cut, but so far it has never bothered to release it in the United States. If you have a free DVD for the region, there's a Director's Cut Cut available in the UK so there's hope. If you happen to find the rare release without US functionality for any reasonable price, I suggest you get it without any questions as Sony has not made any announcements to make any reprinting. If you're a Monty Python fan, then check out Erik the Viking. Those of you who do not have the whole Python-style humor will not appreciate that either. If you like a little humor on the wall mixed with some mythical Norwegian legends (and you're not critical in low production budgets), then this film should be a nice diversion from reality.""",1
"b'We all met Clint Eastwood through his work. The countless first Western television shows and the films he played in him presented us. His role has changed from Star to Superstar in his epic depictions of ""Dirty Harry"", the inspector of the murder. From those days, we have seen his excellence as a director in many other excellent dramas and westerns. Although controversial, we have scrutinized in his morale and sense of care above and beyond the cultural senses of morality in Million Dollar Baby. And now, at the age when you would think that Dirty Harry would just be hanging out in retirement, drinking his beer and smoking cigarettes on the porch, Clint Eastwood directed and starred in a movie where he retired drinking beer and smoking cigarettes on the veranda, snarling at everyone, his neighbors, his war experiences and his own family ! In Gran Torino, it shows that it is possible to teach an old dog new tricks. Always imbued with hatred, bigots and racial stereotypes, he is slowly being changed by his Hmong immigrant neighbors. While taking a young Hmong teenager under his wing (though at first it was done to protect the one thing he really loves, his vintage Garnet, Gran Torino of 1972,) takes young Thao away from the purposeless gangster-band and `` Mans \'\' Thao up. (According to his learned, erect imperfect standards.) While doing so, he discovers that on the human emotional side, he really has much more in common with the ethics of immigrants than he has with his relatives! Since ""Walt"" softens and learns to appreciate the generosity and hospitality of the Immigrants, we see the true heart of our ""Dirty Harry"". ""Now has more purpose in life than to hate everyone and love his Gran Torino.When young Thao is"" man enough ""to go out with an appointment, Walt even lets the young man (who has tried preciously to steal his true love) use his Gran Torino to take the girl out in a stylish appointment! And when the neighborhood band threatens and tries to kill the immigrant family, Walt leaves out the Dirty Harry and sacrifices himself to protect the people who have adopted the ""old"" crunchy bastard ""as one of them!"" Walt\'s last request was to give Thao his Gran Torino in the last scene, when we see Thao driving Walt\'s old Gran Torino, the car with the grid that he frowned as Walt did, the joy on Thao\'s face reveals that not only is Thao leading Walt\'s soul, but Walt\'s soul was transplanted into the young Thao! If all that Clint Eastwood did in this film worth it is this: show how, in a changing America, that embracing and celebrating diversity in this country, we all reinforce in the first place what this country is the protagonist of! ""One among many""'",1
"b""This DVD is a real treasure, especially if like me, you've seen the band live and you've never had enough of them. It's a lot of fun watching these live performances and even meeting the band, and getting them into their tired, drunk, rockin, kiddin around, he says. the DVD is also about the problem of am! the universal is asked to sign a record deal with them, but they are! he remained faithful to Fat Wreck and will not be part of the company car. much respect for them for that decision. (if you go to a show, say hello to the band, they're so friendly and you can probably talk to them there =) the energy of this band is captured on this dvd and I'm so grateful to them for making this dvd and all their many album. I'm not sure what else I should write for this review! against me ! It's one of the most rock bands and I'm so grateful that they put their political opinions out there shamelessly! right above! few bands have such politics and lively, passionate, thoughtful, noisy and rock music. thanks, I am! the only downside of this DVD is that it makes you lose them. It supports independent music out there, that's a part of the revolution!""",1
"b""When a nuclear submarine drops unexpectedly into the Pacific Ocean and a hurricane prevents the military from being able to send a team after it, they subcontract an undersea oil drilling team near the area led by Bud Brigman (Ed Harris). To help the rig team, the army sends a group of Navy SEALs led by Lieutenant Coffey (Michael Biehn), accompanied by the designer of the underwater oil rig and Bud, once again the wife of Lindsey Brigman (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio). But as they search for nuclear submarines, they realize that there may be more to sinking the submarine than they thought, and while Lieutenant Coffey believes the Russians are responsible, the crew thinks there might be something more ... supernatural involved. There are a few directors who really know how to overcome themselves with every effort as James Cameron does. His first film, The Terminator, created a precedent for action films in the '80s, and only surpassed this milestone with Terminator 2. With Aliens he made a film that was at least equal to Ridley's Aliens. Scott, making a sequel that changed the atmosphere and style while respecting the original. In 1989, James Cameron directed The Abyss, a film that was mainly under water, and was shot in the largest underwater set of the era. The set, built in a half-finished nuclear reactor plant, included 7 million liters of water. So, among other successes of Cameron, how is The Abyss? The Abyss is definitely Cameron's most underrated film. Watching movies like Avatar, Aliens, The Terminator and Terminator 2 is easy to see how a movie like The Abyss can be forgotten, but on closer inspection The Abyss fits perfectly with others. Like the other Cameron films, it shows great attention to detail, with surprising special effects. On a technical scale, the film looks like a real life, something that is always great when it comes to a Cameron film. But even like the other Cameron films, it is not about the special effects, but rather about the human element. Cameron does a great job of humanizing his characters and their relationship. The acting if phenomenal, of course I would not expect anything less from a film that includes Michael Biehn (The Terminator, Aliens) and Ed Harris (The Truman Show, The Rock). Biehn is as good as a soldier who has lost communication with the outside world and has to make calls alone on their next move, and he is driving him crazy. Ed Harris is as good as the head of the hard ass who pisses for his ex-wife who continues to escape for several jobs without him, and Marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio is as big as the wife above who is stuck with Bud and the his repellent crew, but grows close to the husband he left behind and the crew he manages. If you have not seen this film, but you like Cameron's other films, I highly recommend you to give this shot. I would say that this film is perhaps even better than The Terminator, and since I think Aliens is better than The Terminator, I find it to be on par with Aliens. Give it a try, this is definitely a sleeper classic that deserves more exposure than it is obtained.""",1
"b'(5/3/12, 1 star for this Blu-ray version, 5 stars for the film) I have the regular DVD with English subtitles, which StudioCanal has inexplicably omitted from their Blu-ray version. Why should they do it? Earn some extra money? Apart from the insensitivity, it is certainly a wrong financial calculation on their part. There are countless cinephiles with a not perfect hearing that will probably transmit this version. My wife is a native English speaker who does not need English subtitles to capture all the dialogues, especially when the actors have British accents. He will not watch the Blu-ray version, and since we always watch movies together, I will not do it either. I imagine there are millions of viewers around the world who feel the same way.'",0
"b""Madacy did it again ... took what could be a decent DVD and turned them into trash. The video transfer from the movie is very poor, but the worst is the audio.

This is a pity because young people who have never seen these classics can go away with the wrong impression.""",0
"b'This is a bad presentation of the ""great battles"" of the Second World War. To begin with, in an alleged introduction to the causes of the Second World War - probably written at a time in 1946, when the Soviets had to be satisfied - the authors do not even mention the German-speaking pact of 1939! ! ! ! The rest is a superficial, long and tedious collection of news and other images, with poor sounds and rudimentary texts. To avoid.'",0
"b""It was the franchise that slugfest fans thought would never happen except in the form of a comic book. After years and years of failed attempts and false departures, the powers that eventually joined. Hoping to take advantage of the successful smash of two successful horror franchises with Freddy vs. Jaso, two of the most famous science fiction creatures tiptoe against Alien Vs. Predator with those annoying humans caught in the middle. There is no clich\xc3\xa9; that this movie does not like. Single-use characters are generally drawn. For example, a bottle cap worn around a character's neck is considered a distinctive trait. The film even manages to include that old chestnut where the characters pass a fireball explosion. Fans waiting for the alien races to start slugging will have to wait almost an hour before their first battle but it's pretty impressive as they launch each other like something from a comic book. Of course, the combat scenes are quite beautiful in all their glory assisted by the CGI, but it is certainly not an endorsement. Master Lance Henriksen is staggering around here as a selfish businessman who provides the only human connection to Alien's other films (it is understood that he is the inspiration for the Bishop in Aliens android). It is only in about a quarter of the film before it is sent quickly. There is an audio commentary by the writer / director Paul W.S. Anderson and actors Lance Henriksen and Sanaa Lathan. They connect together apparently unaware of the narrative chaos that is this film. Also included is an audio commentary by the visual effects supervisor John Bruno and the creator of the creature effects Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr. Anyone wishing to hear this kind of detail will find this informational track. There are three scenes erased for two minutes and include a bit of Predator humor that has been cut correctly. Also included are two trailers and a gallery of comic book covers at Dark Horse's Alien Vs. Series of predators.Alien vs. Predator is not worth the wait and the fans of the comic will feel cheated. The film starts slowly, but once the Aliens and the Raiders start fighting each other, the weak script and the clumsy plot fades mercifully into the background. It's a shame because both of these alien races are ripe for countless story ideas that the subsequent sequels have not been able to capitalize effectively. All we have left is a good paint film by number.""",0

"b""I was terribly excited to find out that one of my favorite classic films, 1963 Peter Brooks & quot; Lord of the flies & quot; it was on DVD. I was even more excited when I saw he was given a luxury treatment by some study called Criterion. & quot; Lord of the flies & quot; it was the first DVD I bought and introduced me to the phenomenal Criterion Collection. Every extra on this DVD is fantastic and interesting, there are no fills or no meaningful praises. The comment alone is worth the price of this DVD, offers a magnificent view of how this film was made: for example, the film was one of the first independent productions ever produced. This is one of those rare comments that adds to your appreciation and understanding of the film, I rank it next to & quot; Seven Samurai & quot; and & quot; Grand Illusion & quot; (even both Criterion DVDs) are some of the best I've ever heard. The film itself seems absolutely fantastic, better worlds than any VHS or laserdisc edition I had seen before; The criterion produced an amazing and clean image that would affect any video set. _Lord of the Flies_ is one of my favorite novels; Golding masterfully touched on many issues and concepts about society and managed to capture the essence of humanity in the caricatures of the boy he created. For the most part, these themes and ideas meet very closely in the film. As indicated in the DVD commentary; there is no credit for the script, because there was no script, the production group worked directly from the novel, using it as the sole source of the story. The result is an extraordinarily clear and coherent adaptation of the original novel, brought to life with great faith and striking prowess for a first-time director. Some technical limitations can still be seen in the final product, but they do little to diminish your enjoyment of the film. In short: a fantastic, dark and gripping story is brilliantly brought back to life in such a rigid way that it sometimes appears as a spectator as an evolving documentary. Finally, to finish, the film received a royal treatment on DVD that perfectly integrates and improves the film itself; in all, the admission price is very worth.""",1

"b'OK, I read the book at middle school and I fell in love with it! I must have read it several times. I recommend it to all my friends. When, years later, I heard that they were filming a movie, I was so excited! I was literally jumping up and down. I could not wait to see a new film of werewolf and also from my favorite book. I thought it would be nice if it was the number 1 at the box office! So I dragged my friends to see it on the opening date. First of all I noticed that for an appointment the theater was not very crowded. I thought ""oh, well maybe people did not understand the title."" Less than half way he threw the film, my mouth was left open in disbelief! It was an ABOMINIO! They where they massacre everything with their false interpretation of the book and using horrible effects! I did not pass from the human directly to the wolves in the glow of a light of light effects! And I almost cried when I saw the ending! It was completely opposite the book! What the hell used a butter knife of silver to stab her!!!! The whole movie missed the torment, the feelings and the pawn that Vivian was going through at the end of the book.I highly recommend to the people who watched this movie to read the BOOK! so many times if it had not been for my friends I cursed all the time I saw this horrible movie! It made my favorite book so trivial and fake that it was awesome! If there where a lower rating then 1 st I would have put it! I really hope someone else arrives for a long time and makes this book the film that could have been! What the hell could have been as good as Twilight or better if they had followed the BOOK!'",0
"b'Ghost World is a training story that defines the character of a generation that is one of the most elusive in modern memory. Enid (Thora Birch) is stuck in a small town with peers and adults who do not go anywhere. Only Norman, the senior bus passenger, is reliable in his view - perhaps because he is at least trying to leave the city - even if this is not something that is thrown to the public, but rather something to think about. This is a meditative film with captivating characters, sharp spirit and sweet warmth. The composition including the use of color in sets and in costume is lush and crisp; highly expressive editing and camera. I highly recommend this film to anyone who would like to better understand the lives and problems of middle-class youths struggling with identity research in the late twentieth century.'",1

"b'As a veteran of the Navy and Vietnam, I do not agree with Brennan\'s portrait of the second part of this film. The war scenes were marginal and could not capture the ""realism"" of the war ... The platoon was much better in this regard. Mainly because Oliver Stone was a veteran, himself. However the FMJ training camp scenes were dead accurate. R. Lee Ermey interpreted the Drill Instructor to perfection, as it should have been, having been the same in real life. I had several D.I. It\'s like that in the training camp and I can assure you it was like that during the Vietnam war. I can laugh at the film now, but while I was in the training camp it was not funny, we were there to learn how to fight and go to war, other skills had been learned, but they were secondary. We had to be tough and made sure we were. The portion of the training camp was almost like a documentary for me! That said, the film was like two parts for me. The first half and the second half. With one being dead and the other just so completely and completely based on a Hollywood perception of what war was like. For those who were not there, believe me ... It was very different from this version. Overall, thanks to the performance of R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D\'Onofrio, I give it 4 stars.'",1
