"b'If ever a movie needed subtitles in English, this is one. The accents and the soft conversations are great but difficult to follow because you can not understand what they say and they do not have subtitles. Their songs were simply beautiful and the story is great, but you lose a lot by not grasping what they say. But it was a most refreshing movie now. Good acting and history.'",1
"b""`` Just Married '' is a painfully cheesy movie that is almost too cheerful and tender. Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy play a couple of Romeo and Juliet that has been repeated in so many movies, is disgusting: he is the classic sports fan and the son of middle-income parents, and she is the daughter of a billion whose profession we never learn Her parents would have preferred to marry her to the snob of Peter Prentice, a boring antagonist who is more of an obstacle than a real character. Anyway, the cute couple gets married and travels to Europe where their lies between them and the incredible circumstances (they are expelled from a hotel after they ruin the circuit system when trying to connect some kind of sex toy) make it difficult to enjoy of the perfect honeymoon The movie got worse with bad jokes, boring characters and clich\xc3\xa9 and egrave; stories. I think I considered laughing once. The terrible thing about this movie was how amazing everything was. Each character was able to bring out a beautiful and moving monologue from nothing. Most of the speeches did not even fit the personality of the character, for example, Kutcher's character gave at least two of these monologues, and each was one of the best parts of the script of the film. Too bad they seemed forced and uncomfortable, since it is assumed that the character is not the brightest bulb in the box. Finally, the characters were painfully underdeveloped. We do not know if Murphy's character likes to be rich or not, and we can not really discern whether she is a rich ditz or an intellectual lover of art. We never found out what Murphy's father does, and although a good and strong father-son relationship between the character of Kutcher and his father is insinuated, we never know for sure. Finally, an attractive blonde was constantly close to Murphy's character ... was she a sister? friend ? cousin ? It bothered me throughout the movie. So, why not 1 star instead of 2? Well, Murphy and Kutcher proved to be excellent actors with incredible chemistry together. Murphy especially illuminated the screen with his dazzling personality and his cute and rough voice. Kutcher will be typecast forever as the fool, but he is a character that suits him. I discovered that they were the only highlights of the movie. In the last row: this movie kept me awake. It was quick and pleasant, but something fresh or different was missing. See if you like teenage chick fliks, not if your idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8ba movie is what will make you think.""",0
"b'I may not be able to add much to the reviews, whose compliments I totally agree with the content of this magnificent movie, but I still felt compelled to offer my two cents on the BluRay, which is equally fantastic. With the measure of the grandeur of the pure grandfather of the backdrop of this story now rightly restored in HiDef, the inherent drama of the plot now, finally, finally, has an equally valuable canvas on which it will present itself: a fact that It has been perpetually lost in every other video presentation I\'ve seen before. In fact, it is an impressive revaluation of the expected impact of this film and, from all the previous video editions, a transformation from a first level adventure, in another acceptably good way, to a first level adventure and, in Overall, an extraordinary show! I dare say it did not seem so good when I remember seeing it in my local theater so many years ago. For that matter, it looks so good, I do not think anyone can dream, since its appearance here, that this film, in fact, is approaching its 50th anniversary. From the opening credits, I see that the film was originally filmed on 70 mm, with much more detail than the more common 35 mm films. You can expect similar performance in HiDef with other movies of the 65 or 70 mm variety, such as 2001: A Space Odessy or Lawrence of Arabia - IF the disk transfer is good - and here it certainly is. The image inside the frame on this disc is always, and completely, as stable as the Rock of Gibralter. There was only the smallest amount of flicker, as seen in my configuration, but, again, only rarely and barely noticed when it was seen, I\'m still not sure if the disc was blameless or not. Not a shred of moir\xc3\xa9, nowhere. The sound is quite good and much better than I had any reason to wait. Although John Barry\'s excellent score was apparently originally in mono, it is by far the best I\'ve heard of him before; it even has a better impression than the original soundtrack (mono) available on CD, if memory serves me. However, the sound effects track on this disc is true stereo or, more likely, is derived from several isolated sound effects elements and then ""panned"" during postproduction. There are even some good extras: more than two documentaries about the making of the film, comments about the film, the theatrical trailer and even a brief, but interesting interview with John Barry himself, about the origins of his ideas for the score. But, in general, I love it when a film as majestic and monumental as this one receives the real treatment it has here. Sometimes, the presentation is everything! Highly recommended! !'",1
"b""I have been a 3D nut for many decades. I pre-ordered this from amazon and man, what disappointment! The video quality is only slightly better than the shutter 3D DVD shutter since the 90s (and at least the 3D DVD was COMPLETE SCREEN) that was made from a 3D Japanese VHD disc. Even the `` red / blue '' 3D trailer of this film (from 3D Film Expo at the Egyptian Theater here in Hollywood) was Full Screen. If you search Google for this title, you will find some websites with photographic comparisons (PAL, NTSC, DVD, Blu-ray, etc.) and you can clearly see that this 3D Blu-ray reaps the film from ALL FOUR SIDES. Only a little is cropped from the left / right, but a bit is missing from the top and bottom to create this ratio of 1.85 from Full screen. Part of the 3D perception is lost because of this, and is probably what others here have meant with certain scenes that look like `` flat '' or `` 2D ''. One of the most striking scenes is one in which Margot and Mark are talking in the living room. This wonderful photo is obviously set up for the 3D effect. Margot's hand rests on the final table in the foreground, showing that beautiful diamond ring. Guess what ? In this Blu-ray 3D release, ALL your hand is completely cut! I kept noticing these scenes cut out throughout the film ... characters cut out in the waste, covers of lampshades cut out, etc. Yes, it's great to see that the red dress looks REALLY red, but unfortunately the colors are severely oversaturated. I think I'll stop at `` House of Wax '' or `` Creature FTBL '' until they get criticism from other guinea pigs out there, ha ha! I'm sure others will agree that the black ink printed on the Blu-ray disc itself seems horrible. I've seen better labels on pirated DVDs! Anyway, just my 2 cents.""",0

"b'If you look at the fine print of this DVD, you will see that it is not approved by the Wayne Foundation. And what a note. The image quality of this DVD has all the characteristics of being a DVD recording of a VHS copy of the movie. They did not even bother using a new VHS tape: judging by the grainy texture and the annoying flaws that prevail (blinks, ""hairs"" on the screen, etc.) it was captured from an old copy of the tape. I have a VHS tape that has a better image than this DVD. Everyone PLEASE write the Wayne Foundation and tell them about the poor quality release of this movie! If we make ourselves heard, we could convince them to publish panoramic versions of Criterion quality of the less famous films of John Wayne. UPDATE: PLEASE BE AWARE! This revision DOES NOT APPLY NECESSARILY TO THE SPECIAL EDITION. Amazon is mixing all the McLintock! Check in a single bag.

""I was hoping that the film version would give me a creepy version of the original story, but all I got was bad acting, a dull story and terrible effects."" The director seemed to have an excellent idea in his head, but he could not project it. They tried too hard to make the story ""better."" As a result, the story came out as corny and exaggerated. If you want to get a better and more accurate version of the story, check the `` A Haunting \'\' version.'",0
"b""... but a terrible DVD. The sound is old Dolby Surround and the movie is in full screen. This seems very annoying to me. I've always liked Joshua Tree and I was waiting for its release on DVD. I imagined a widescreen, Dolby 5.1, trailers, comments and motion menus. But none of that happened. Artisan disappointed me SO MUCH with this poor release and lacking in imagination. I would like to start a campaign for Artisan to change his mind. To re-launch this impressive film in widescreen format. They must do this since this movie is totally rock. Even the current cover is tremendously horrible. A temperamental image of a Joshua Tree would be better. One last thing. Amazon and the back of the DVD indicate that the runtime is 102 minutes when in reality it is the unclassified version 106. This version should remain intact in the future widescreen release.""",0
"b""From time to time I have revisited this movie. Entertaining is. `` El Dorado '' has its funniest moments, James Caan goes on and on about '' riding boldly '' in a poem about El Dorado, Maudie (the love interest of John Wayne) taking the place where numerous women in Wayne 's the movies have left: `'I'm not going to cry. '' I'm going to buy a pine box, about 6 feet for you, and then the required speech about how men are fools for fighting and women are saints for bravely waiting for their men to come home, blah, blah, blah. He has a geezer companion (Arthur Honeycutt) who imitates Walter Brennen from `` Rio Bravo '', James Caan who imitates Ricky Nelson from `` Rio Bravo '' and Mitchum who imitates Dean Martin from `` Rio Bravo '' and , finally, Charlene Holt, who imitates Angie Dickinson in `` Rio Bravo ''. '' See the pattern? `` Rio Bravo '' and `` El Dorado '' are essentially the same movie. A sheriff, his partner and John Wayne, his partner and his girlfriend. Formula. However, here is a good movie. Here are elements of Wild Woolly Westerns. Christopher George plays the bad gunslinger who, however, warms up with John Wayne's Cole Thornton and SPOILER ALERT! It gets to the end. But there is a scene that is golden: George and his gang of bad men enter the bar to see the other bad guy / rancher Edward Asner. When they enter, tinkling piano tunes sound and strut. It is direct from a shooting of 1920. It is not a work of art. But it will entertain. It will grow you with the following exhibitions. John Wayne is the maximum John Wayne with his John Waynisms. Mitchum is more or less a spectator and does the movements. In general, entertaining and a poem for the Cowboy formula movies.""",1
"b""If you want to be alone while you watch Alone In The Dark, there is good news and bad news. The good news is that you will get your wish. The bad news is that misery loves the company. Being hung by red nipple clamps over a pit of cactus and scorpions would be less painful than sitting through this menage a trash about aliens, monsters, nefarious scientists, kidnapped children, a paranormal putz and Tara Reid as a museum curator. Pell\xc3\xadceme, I must be dreaming. Better a pinch than a slap in the face, which is what this hokey poky of a movie offers. Alone in the Dark is supposedly based on an old Atari game, one I've never heard of. What I do remember about the old games of Atari were its graphics and rudimentary plots. I doubt that the later extended history of the film was even a consideration. So to fill in the blanks, writers Elan Mastai, Michael Roesch and Peter Scheerer borrow and steal from other films. Best Movies. Movies that make you realize that you are not only watching an imitation, but a really bad imitation, like Chuck Norris doing his tribute to Judy Garland. I'll admit that his interpretation of the Easter Parade made me cry, but only because he was kicking me in the face. That's what it feels like to see Solo in the dark. I do not care about stupid, stupid horror movies, but I hate the stupid, stupid horror movies that refuse to acknowledge that fact. Alone in the Dark comes with a poker face so impossible to know if we're supposed to take any of this seriously. We are, but we do not, or more precisely, we can not. There is no room for maneuver in the script, direction or performance. Alone in the Dark abounds with government conspiracies (after a slavishly long crawl), which finds paranormal investigator Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) teaming up with an elite group of government agents to defeat an ancient evil. As an orphan, Edward escaped the clutches of the unscrupulous government agent / scientist Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker), whose depraved experiments turned children into crossed zombies. Now that Hudgens has found the final key to unlocking the portal between darkness and light, it's up to Edward, the former lover and healer Aline Cedrac (Reid) and the command leader Burke (Stephen Dorff) to save humanity. Yes, that's who I would call when the ultimate evil decides to hit humanity: two actors who travel down the lane straight to the video and an actress best known to the paparazzi. Was this a casting decision or a retribution? The director Uwe Boll (The House of the Dead) is not much help, since he never allows the actors to come out of the box of paper or express any emotion beyond the written word. If everyone, in front or behind the camera, simply recognized the obvious, Alone in the Dark would have been a hoot. Computer-generated monsters that never seem to occupy the same frame as the actors, trigger-happy commands, an intricate plot that does not make sense, characters from paper dolls, all the symbols of a good silly moment. Very bad the people behind Alone in the Dark did not fall into that trap.""",0
"b""We keep yawning while we watch this stinky Sony. It's probably the worst digital animation movie we've seen, and we've seen all the big ones. BUT, we gave it 2 stars and not one because it has some funny scenes. But, those funny scenes are very few. It really lacks humor for adults. Children CAN enjoy it (we do not have any, so we can not comment). Please, do not waste your money on this movie unless you are sure that your little ones like it.""",0
"b""Still disappointing. I really had hope, but between the confusing lines and the bad performance it was quite hard to bear. I think the wolves chasing the vampire were the best of the movie. It lacked completely emotional connection, I think it was actually worse than the twilight if that were possible. I'm completely surprised that with such a large budget and a fan base, they still can not get close to doing it right. The cheesy costumes, makeup, even the soundtrack were bad. Go read the books, there is no comparison.""",0

The word & quot; leverage & quot; it is repeated over and over again, it is as if the director wanted to hypnotize his audience with subliminal messages. The previous reviewer said it all ... & quot; It's like riding & quot; , read that too. This movie is ridiculous, I'm an SFX designer and I felt insulted with the plot made towards science fiction movies throughout this one. My advice is to avoid this ... no ... scartch that ... rent it and see HOW badly it can be a movie.Buah haa haa haaa haaa!""",0
"b""I do not know who I feel for more, Stephen Dorff or Christian Slater. Dorff, who is a great actor, although you would never know it from the films he is in, has not been anywhere remotely good since the original Blade in 1998. Slater's career has been declining over the years, by participating in some flop projects. Both sleepwalking actors through their roles in this latest video game for the adaptation of the screen of director Uwe Boll, the same guy who brought us another adaptation of video game, the incredibly bad House of the Dead. Alone in the Dark is not much better, with a history so nonexistent that you will be scratching your head wondering what is going on before praying for all to be killed. Tara Reid is also on board as the smart girl, and as mentioned by previous critics, we know she is smart because she wears glasses. There is no redeeming factor about Alone in the Dark, and if you submit to the House of the Dead farce, then you know what to expect here.""",0
"b""This DVD tries to put in an hour all the history of the exploration of North America. Given his goal, I think he does a decent job doing it. He summarized five hundred years of history and many dozens of expeditions and explorers in brief pieces of information. I do not think that this is a good educational tool, since it would probably lack interest, it does not have very interesting stories, only a flow of information. Rather, this is a good starting point for someone who wants to research exploration in North America and wants an introduction to the main events and people in their history. It's not really something that excites people about the story, people who see this should already be excited.""",1
"b""I really thought it would be amazing to watch a movie in 3D AND HD ... but unfortunately they have not found a way to provide a 3D experience at home without discoloration of the characters. Because of the glasses everything in the image has a green tinge. In a way, it defeats HD's purpose. Apart from that, the movie is pretty good! I have not yet seen the 2d version, so I really can not review that aspect of the disc, but there are some neat 3D effects despite the green people.""",1
"b'The special effects were fine, but the story was weak, silly and predictable. When I was a kid, I loved the Alien movies. Aliens (the second) is considered a classic in our house as we still laugh at how my mother made M & M rain in the theater after an alien frightened her. Then, with that, I was excited to see this movie and relive some of the memories. What a disappointment. It was not terrifying at all. The people in the theater were actually *** SLEEPING ***. I was jealous of them. In general, I was glad that this was a short film. Sadly, the most terrifying thing in this movie was a penguin. Do not see this.

"b""I can not say how bad this movie is. The only reason he got a star was that Amazon does not have zero stars. This is just a bad movie. It's not even a good movie, nor is it fun to watch. The underlying premise is interesting, in a kind of six degrees, and from it one would expect an Indian-style two-hand adventure. There are two worlds, one good, one bad. An ancient civilization once opened the door between these two worlds before, and was annihilated. Now, the key has been broken (why was it not destroyed? They never destroy these things!) And it is sent to the four corners of the earth. Now, take everything that has been ordered, exciting, fun and interesting from an Indiana Jones movie and let it run through the bathroom a few times. Immerse it and put it in a movie with some inept acting and inaction. Turn that on and there you have it, Alone in the Dark. What a waste .""",0

"b'Before seeing this, do not make the mistake of grouping this movie with silly comedies like `` Tootsie \'\' and `` Mrs. Doubtfire. ""Although based on a true story, director Greenwald eludes many of the Western (and Hollywood) conventions to bring one of the best westerns of the 1990s. Suzy Amis plays Jo, a woman who is too confident with some men After escaping to the west and leaving her child born out of wedlock, she is almost raped by two soldiers.To hide from them, she wears men\'s clothes and heals her face, eventually using her new fa\xc3\xa7ade to get what she wants. Ian McKellen plays the role of a woman who hates women, believing he is a young man, and eventually befriends Bo Hopkins, who has his best role in years, and starts a sheep ranch. She falls in love with a Chinese woman who was forced to hire her as her cook, and eventually she has to fight against a group of cattle that tries to carve out and expel the ranchers, Am\xc3\xa9s looks like Eric Stoltz in his scenes as a man, and it is totally credible McKellan and Rene Auberjonois have small but fundamental roles as older father figures in whom Amis trusts, but eventually turn against her. Bo Hopkins is excellent since the neighbor Amis tolerates, befriends and tolerates. David Chung plays the Chinese man nicknamed Tin Man as a defective man addicted to sick opium. It looks perfect for the part, scars of life and everything. Heather Graham also has a small part as lover of Amis, and does her best with her. The most surprising thing about this movie is what the movie is not. There are no nice scenes of ""Yentl"", where Amis falls in love with a man like a man. The war of the cattle company, a standard point of the western plot, never overwhelms history, or reaches a trivial conclusion. The final scenes, with the unmasking of Jo, seem almost a farce, but when you think about them later, they play with great sincerity and movingly, especially Hopkins\' reaction. Greenwald\'s camera turns a small movie into an epic, with a splendid scene from Montana. His script is also very smart, he\'s never going for the cheap laughs or the kind of exploitation a director might have done. I recommend `` Little Jo\'s ballad. `` Has a grade (R) for physical violence, strong armed violence, sexual violence, spilled blood, some blasphemy, female nudity, sexual content, sexual references, drug abuse and adult situations.'",1
"b""I bought this DVD without having seen it in the theater or in a video. I bought it based on the good reviews I saw in the best ten end of the year lists. This is one of the few (unique) animated works that does not double as a musical. It is based solely on the strength of its characters to tell the compelling story of the young `` Hogarth '' (yes, Hogarth!) Who befriends a giant robot that landed forcefully on Earth during the 1950s. Naturally, the military and other adults suspect the seemingly benign giant. The true strength of this film is that both adults and children will enjoy it because it works on several levels. It's a sneaky comment about the paranoia of the 1950s (without being clumsy), an exciting adventure film and a comedy that has humor for adults and children. Both will fall in love with the `` Iron Giant '' (voice of Vin Diesal, from `` Saving Private Ryan '') that will finally teach humans a thing or two about loyalty and sacrifice. A word of warning for those with very young children: there are some `` cursed '' and `` hells '' (3 or 4) throughout the film; therefore, your PG rating.""",1
"b""I agree with the revision of Shemp Newberg. I have other Stefan Grossman DVDs, of which I have talked a lot. I have this to start learning the bottleneck.

I guess I'll look for another introduction to the bottleneck. On a positive note, there are fantastic historical clips of legends of the bottleneck, if you like those things (which I do).""",0
"b'Without a doubt the best Carmen I\'ve seen, apart from the Sunday film (I have not seen the performance of van Otter). The highlights are, of course, the performances of the soprano directed by Domashenko and Dashuk; both finish their roles correctly, even if the first one is not very subtle, but somehow I do not think Carmen was a lady of nuances. One simply has to emphasize its beauty: they are really impressive to see. I saw a Turandot a few nights ago (another production of Zeffirelli) that was ruined as a show because the princess was played by a lady who was the size of a hospitality tent (and was not a great singer either). Strangely, in this production, the protagonists are those who raise an eyebrow; they are middle-aged, overweight and visually unconvincing, and this diminishes credibility, given Zeffirelli\'s emphasis on the ""look"" of a production; It is difficult to see how Jos\xc3\xa9 and Escamillo could, in modern language, ""attract"" women in that way! OK, maybe the fame of the latter is a factor. As for the singing, the sopranos excelled, Berti was fine, Acelo medio, and one or two of the support singers rather doubtful. The director and the orchestra were good. As another critic remarked, it is not difficult to believe that all the families of Verona were represented on the massive stage, besides many tourists. There were more horses on stage than running in the Grand National, and I think I saw my dog, who had gone for a walk, in one of the scenes. Without elephants And yes, the constant search of male singers for the driver\'s track was annoying, but with so many people on stage, it\'s a shame they did not have to jump in the air to get the beat. But these are cavilos. I really enjoyed the presentation, more as a show than as a great opera. I think my dog \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bdid it too when he returned very late.'",1

"b""It was the franchise fight that fans thought would never happen, except in the form of comics. After years and years of failed attempts and false starts, the powers finally succeeded. Hoping to capitalize on the amazing success of the merger of two successful horror franchises with Freddy vs. Jaso, two of the most popular science fiction creatures face each other face to face in Alien vs. Predator with those annoying humans trapped in the middle. There is not a clich\xc3\xa9 and eacute; that this movie does not like Disposable characters are widely sketched. For example, a bottle cap worn around the neck of a character is considered a defining feature. The film even manages to include that old chestnut tree where the characters overcome a fireball explosion. Fans who expect the two alien races to start hitting would have to wait almost an hour until their first battle, but it's pretty impressive as they throw each other out like something out of a comic book. It is true that the fight scenes are great in all their glory assisted by CGI, but this is not an endorsement. Poor Lance Henriksen is swaggering him here as a selfish entrepreneur who provides the only human link to the other Alien films (insinuating that he is the inspiration for the Android bishop in Aliens). It's only in about a quarter of the movie before it's dispatched quickly. There is an audio commentary by writer / director Paul W.S. Anderson and actors Lance Henriksen and Sanaa Lathan. They connect apparently as oblivious to the narrative disorder that is this movie. Also included is an audio commentary from visual effects supervisor John Bruno and creature effects designers Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr. Anyone who wants to hear these details will find this clue. There are three deleted scenes that total a total of two minutes and include a bit of Predator humor that was cut correctly. Also included are two advances and a gallery of the covers of the comics. to Dark Horse 's Alien vs. Predator series. Alien vs. Predator was not worth the wait and the fans of the comic will feel cheated. The movie begins slowly, but once the aliens and predators begin to hit each other, the weak script and the clumsy plot mercifully fade into the background. It's a shame because both alien races are ready for innumerable story ideas that subsequent sequels have not been able to capitalize effectively. All we have left is a good paint film by numbers.""",0

"b""`` Battlefield Earth '' is considered one of the WORST movies ever made. It makes `` Hands, Hands of Fate '' look like a profound, human and moving drama about suffering in the hands of a cult and `` Plan 9 from outer space '' seems like a profound meditation on world peace and the dangers of science `` Battlefield '' has holes in plots bigger than Swiss cheese, and to think that it was a labor of love (!!!) John Travolta saw this film as a tribute to L. Ron Hubbard. But it ended a catastrophic failure. And no wonder. `` Battlefield '' has human beings living in primitive conditions, at the mercy of the dreadlocked psychics led by John Travolta and Forest Whitaker. Human civilization lies in ruins. The special effects, sometimes, especially with the ruins, are convincing. Pity about the rest of the movie. Barry Pepper (who seems to have retired, or something like that) stars as the hero, '' Jonny Goodboy. '' Not inventing that. Being a prisoner of the Psychlos, he manages to learn to read, fly planes, fire guns, all in a remarkably short period of time. As for the psychos, what was their motivation in world domination? Gold ! And yet, they were not able to find Fort Knox after blowing it all to pieces. Silent premise, horrible acting, a horrible makeup scene between Travolta and his real life wife, Kelly Preston ... it's better not to see her. This movie makes you suffer Moment for Moment, and Travolta wondered if his career was Living Live. At least, her taste for camp movies has not changed, as she acted as the mother of Tracy Turnblatt in Hairspray (Full Screen Edition). The love of bad movies is a battlefield.""",0
"b""The third installment of the popular & quot; Beverly Hills Cop & quot; series is like a distant relative who comes to stay with you. At first, you are happy to see them and catch up with the old days, but they will surely exhaust your welcome quickly. This movie reaches that point after about fifteen minutes. Eddie returns as Alex Foley, the increasingly unlikely fish detective out of the water in Detroit. Once again, Axel is battling with the police establishment, the Beverly Hills Police Department and the bad guys who killed his friend. Sounds familiar ? Even Serge (Bronson Pinchot) is back, in a desperate and painful scene that seems to last forever. The direction of veteran Murphy driver John Landis is acceptable, and shows Landis's usual style for rhythm and acrobatics. However, the script of the generally decent Steven deSouza is woefully half cooked. It is never clear what the tone of the image is supposed to be. The action scenes are very impromptu and are often played to laugh, while the comedy scenes are forced and without grace. History never builds the sense of danger and conflict that is essential for a film of this kind. It is not a riot of laughter, not remotely full of suspense. Also, any movie that makes Hector Elizondo (one of the best character actors) look bad has serious problems. There are two good things about & quot; Cop III. & quot; One of them is an excellent action sequence set in an amusement park on the Ferris wheel. That is the only exciting part of the movie. The other thing that I liked was the series of cameos from a variety of famous film directors (like George Lucas), a typical Landis gag. At least it gives you something to look for in some pretty boring scenes.""",0
"b'I agree 100% with the comments of other reviewers ... If you like this movie, do not buy this DVD. This version is terrible. I saw it once and I wanted to take the disc out, place it in my driveway and run it over with my car, repeatedly. Go back to the editing school, Bill Jones. Truly insulting to anyone who is a fan of this movie. I would give you negative stars if I could.'",0
"b'The performance in this movie sucks, laughably. Even Tara Reid can not save this movie. What, Reid is a scientist because she puts on glasses? She looks more like a gymnastics trainer. Is Christian Slater smarter? The address is almost as bad as some Ed Wood movies. The film may have had a sci-fi storyline, but the movie hardly explored any part of its plot. The film is not only bad, it is sometimes boring, it is only stimulated by the fun of the scripts that are carried out horribly and by the action without sense. For the most part, this film incriminates its director. I give this movie two stars out of five. This movie at least had some images. I did not hate his stupidity as much as that other film also based on a video game, ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"", which I considered the worst movie of his year.'",0
"b'These DVDs have catapulted our sex life. My partner and I have found the ""buttons"" of others and we are having a great time. Since I saw the DVDs, one of the things that I love doing is reaching it, and I have become very good at feeling when it is at the top and desperate to review. It seems that he loves everything I do during this time, and one of my favorite things is to keep it in that moment of intense desire for as long as possible, and as close as possible to review everything possible, before dropping it, or review it. These techniques have answered questions I had for a long time about how to please her, only to generate MORE questions I had not considered before. We have been interested VERY WELL in what she wants, every time we have sex together. My most recent question is this: do women prefer to get up slowly and then go down a little several times, or would they prefer to stay on the edge for prolonged periods? From my perspective, the higher it gets and the more it stays there, the more rewarding it is for me. When I ask what he likes, it seems to be whatever I did at that moment. I\'ve heard that keep it on the verge of so-called ""sweet torture"", and I\'d love to have a woman\'s perspective. As I said, we are really interested in your sexual pleasure, and I attribute this renewed interest in part of the techniques given in the videos. Highly recommended, but ONLY if you want a super-charged sex life! ! !'",1
"b""Great Milestones is an exploration of the breeding habits and mating rituals of various types of animals. Interesting aspects of this topic are how the Moon and the tides regulate and synchronize certain elements of reproduction and how climatic conditions also play a role. Not only are terrestrial animals studied, but some types of underwater creatures are also shown. In the second half of this documentary, parents are touched to protect and feed their newborns. Finish is a look at the young animals that leave the house or nest in the struggle to join the circle of life. With only 60 minutes in duration, this feature can make you want more. The sound, the narration and the video are pretty well done in my opinion. Bonus features are not offered except for a couple of trailers from other programs. The chapters are a bit short due to the time limit, but what is presented is entertaining and enjoyable, nonetheless. As diverse as the animal kingdom is, here we hope that Reader's Digest will make more of this type of documentary. If you are a fan of this type of topics, it is advisable to see them.""",1
"b'I\'m a Blu-ray enthusiast and a Lethal Weapon enthusiast. Therefore, I was VERY disappointed with the quality of the Blu-ray format for this (it looks like DVD quality), but what really drives me crazy is the fact that they are not cut directors. I guess maybe it was a little naive of me to assume that it would be, but come on, this is BLU-RAY of what we\'re talking about here. I was not impressed. Not to mention that the seller said he was in ""good condition"", but that the column and the back of the sleeve were very wrinkled and broken. If this had been a good quality Blu-ray conversion, and the directors have been cut off, I would have minded not looking at the wrinkled sleeve. However, as was not the case, the wrinkled nature was straw. . I just verified on Amazon, and there is STILL no Director\'s Cut available. Until it exists, I will not buy any Lethal Weapon movie on Blu-ray.'",0
"b""This series is very reminiscent of series like Trigun, Full Metal Panic and Outlaw Star, nothing serious, but entertaining, dramatic and funny enough to be very addictive. The first thing to keep in mind is that you do not take most of this series seriously, although if you are looking for a hardcore drama series like Ghost In The Shell, Akira or similar, this series will not be for you, while it has battles of wicks Space and some drama for most of the series, it is mostly happy for the first season. The beginning of the second stage of Vandread becomes a little more dramatic and serious, although especially with the argument of what the people of the Earth have done to the human colonies in space for their own agenda. The main plot of the series is that after more or less a century that the male / female genres separated and lived in different worlds, for some reason they began to fight each other for resources and personal agendas. The stories from both sides about what the other genres are like also make the series very funny, like when you hear the story in the male homeworld about how demonic women are and how they will eat your organs and they are just horrible. Thus begins the uncomfortable journey of three males trapped in a boat of a crowd of attractive females after a battle between the genders becomes chaotic and causes a fusion of the male and female spacecraft. The cast has a great variety of comical situations that make you laugh throughout the show and the characters are hilarious, as you see, when they try to interact between the genres at times. The real cute couple of the series for me was Hibiki Tokai, a third-grade citizen in his world who was basically a humble worker when he was caught on board the ship because he boasted of being able to bring a vanguard, and Dita Liebely a bubbly pilot woman of the ship that wants to contact its first alien and since it has never seen a man before seeing Hibiki as the first alien with whom he has contacted. The video is clear and clear, so there were no complaints and the audio was also good, the cast for both the Japanese / English was also good. Again, as in the recent releases of Funimation, the set consists of four DVDs placed in two thin-film DVD cases and in a paper sleeve, the extras are not just the standard intro / endless songs and some trailers, but the price is still not bad . So if you like sci-fi anime and funny action drama, here's a good one to look at anime collection ...""",1
"b'The good news about this DVD is that it focuses more on Big Brother as a band, instead of focusing exclusively on Janis Joplin, like other documentaries. Unfortunately, the sound quality is generally very poor, and the images are often deleted. This is especially noteworthy because many of the same images have been used in other films such as JANIS, MONTEREY POP, BIG BROTHER: BALL AND CHAIN, and several television specials (A & E, Biography, VH1, etc.), so the comparisons also easy to make. I have reissues of 78 rpm vinyl records on CDs that have been digitally restored to offer a clearer sound than this DVD, and I have seen images of silent movies restored in a similar way, so I can only assume that this documentary was hurriedly thrown the sight put on the quick money and not much concern for the quality of the production. That said, the DVD offers a fascinating look to the band members at that time. Some look back on the Psychedelic Era with nostalgic affection, while others have obviously clung to and tested their grudges for the past 40 years. If they had never met Janis Joplin, the Big Brother story could have been very different: if no one had heard of them, or if they had triumphed on their own terms of blues and raw edges, I would never know. But this DVD offers tantalizing glimpses not only of what it was, but of what might have been.'",0

"b""I bought this DVD as a media filler for my husband. We saw it together in preparation for an upcoming trip to Amsterdam. The film, which tells the life and struggles of the Dutch painter Vincent Van Gogh, was very well made and was one of the best performances of Kirk Douglas. Sometimes it was worrisome because of a harrowing description of Van Gogh's serious mental illness. Other strong performances by Anthony Quinn, who played the painter Paul Gauguin, and James Donald, who played Van Gogh's brother, contributed to the enjoyment of the film. The film was visually stunning and one could see the evolution of Van Gogh's art. I look forward to my trip to see the art of Van Gogh in person.""",1
"b'With a stellar power so high, it is reasonable to expect this film to shine much more. As things stand, it\'s a disaster that goes back to similar ""thrillers"" since the \'90s. Charlotte Berry has a friend who is murdered in an unusual way, right after trusting Berry who was knowing and potentially blackmailing Bruce Willis . , Halle Berry, being a research journalist, resorts to her friend Giovanni Ribisi (the best of the film, and the only person who acts with ambiguity) to hide. Or under the sheets, it might be more appropriate. She poses online to meet him in her favorite chat room, and like a temperature in his office, seducing him to come close enough to discover what she needs to know. Needless to say, the twists and turns continue. Let\'s say immediately, seeing people type instant messages with each other is NOT exciting. And if you\'re expecting a chill of sexual tension or action on the screen, you\'re also likely to be very disappointed. Although it is advertised as an erotic thriller, the action is of the internet type and any alleged tension in the story is of the variety instead of whodunwho ... and it is good that Willis and Berry do not get dirty and dirty. , with the abominable lack of chemistry they seem to have, and the lack of conviction in their papers they exude. Ribisi is the only successful wildcard in the process that leaves us in doubt as to the outcome. That ending may be a supposed turn, but lacks the credibility to be satisfactory, since all the facts jump at the end like a cheap trick in a fun house, instead of a stimulating moment that gathers pieces scattered throughout the film, in the way a better envisioned effort could have been achieved. Defocus, with \'making of ...\' properly flimsy as the only extra. Maybe with the ridiculously superior product replacement they did not feel they needed money from the movie ...'",0
"b'This is a decent movie, but I can not give you a better review because the transfer is terrible. The monogram, ER, of the issuing company is shown throughout the film.

In the technical aspect: the work of the camera is wonderful, with close-ups and great angles for the feeling that you are there. In fact, I would have given this DVD 5 stars, but for the occasionally irregular sound. I can not comment on the 5.1 because I only have a stereo. But keep in mind that sometimes the volume drops suddenly and inexplicably; and in a couple of places, the mixture of mud deceives the listener, as in Crow\'s final moments, which would otherwise be beautiful.

"b""WARNING: this is not really a continuation. This is one of those television movies / miniseries of a theatrical premiere. You will not obtain cinematographic images, you will obtain images of television quality. Too many people do not provide the proper reviews and this is more a betrayal to your consumer bets. The original Storm Riders is an incredible fantasy story, but it's not like that. This is more like a standard kung fu action movie that uses the characters. Storm Riders had that fantasy feeling, this is not it. There is a good kung fu action, but this thing seems incoherent as you try to see it, and that may be because they have tried to cut and paste the film together, if my theory is correct, since it was an adaptation of the miniseries. The story begins and stops without flow. If you just want an action movie with decent fighting scenes, it's tolerable, but by no means is it the caliber of Storm Riders. I would really like them to set a standard that differentiates TV adaptations from real theater versions, such releases tend to be a bit insulting. The ONLY thing that redeems is a very cute actress, and that's it! I've never seen Wind and Cloud so unattractive, and this is based on Aaron Kwock and Ekin Cheng. These 2 are appropriate, but they are not substitutes.""",0
"b""The werewolves of Hollywood have long been characterized as serious creatures who pursue their victims as a shaggy Groucho Marx. The image of this loping wolf was originally recorded by Lon Chaney and the following generations of actors simply continued their style. But with AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, director John Landis not only pushed the werewolf on all fours to resemble nothing less than a stray lycan tank, but also added a touch of much-needed humor to compel spectators to stay momentarily separated from the gore to contemplate what they had just seen. David Naughton and Griffin Dunne are two Americans who travel with their knapsacks through a gloomy English wasteland just outside of Wuthherful Heights. They are attacked by a howling werewolf who kills Dunne but simply bites Naughton before the villagers shoot him. This introductory scene in which Naughton and Dunne are banished by an unfriendly group of pub drinkers is a disturbing mix of scary fears leavened with sharp wit. It is precisely this combination of horror and humor that suggests that the viewer engages in extreme emotions ranging from laughter to suffocation, and the viewer is sometimes not sure which one to choose. Jenny Agutter is a very unappreciated actress who shines like a nurse who falls in love with Naughton, and can not understand a radical change in her eating habits, as she increasingly prefers her rare flesh. Agutter adds an unexpected dimension to a role that, in the hands of another less competent director, could have relegated her to being little more than a swig of visual candy in English. Griffin Dunne provides a visceral humor like a corpse that keeps appearing, like the ghost of Hamlet's father, at the opportune moments to remind Naughton that the price to pay for being free of liquorotropy may be a bit too high. And then there's the music, played on the same line as Simon & amp; The lyrics of Garfunkle from THE GRADUATE, but here Credence Clearwater Revival 's lilting & quot; Bad Moon Rising & quot; accentuates the revealing transformation scenes that a bad moon generates bad vibrations. Finally, Rick Baker's special effects are amazing because you can see lengthening bones, fur sprouts and nasal fins that stretch out while Naughton sees himself as scared as he is at the audience. Ultimately, AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON is an innovator in the werewolf genre in that vision and sound combine to present creatures as helpless in their own way as their own victims.""",1
"b'For its complete disrepute Amazon is publishing reviews of two totally different films as one! There are two versions of The Big Trail: a shot in 35 mm and duration of 110 minutes and launched in 2003, and a newer widescreen version released in 2008 with a duration of more than 122 minutes and filmed in Grandeur 70 mm and completely different in scale and impact. The important version, to add more confusion, comes with the first as a set of boxes. Potential buyers should be aware of this! The `` Full screen edition \'\' will confuse many buyers, in fact, it is nothing like that and therefore, I qualify it with the lowest rating. The film in its historical format deserves a total of FIVE STARS! and can be purchased on the set titled, ""The Big Trail Two Disc Special Edition"", which not only includes this lower version of the DVD, but also the very important and enormously historical ""WIDESCREEN EDITION"" version of the film, since it was shown for the first time. Again, I would easily rate this five-star panoramic editing DVD! The widescreen version lasts 122 minutes and is taken directly from the original 70 mm. The ""Full Screen Edition"" masked here as what it is not is not a cropped version of the panoramic image, but is actually a shorter 35mm version (110 minutes) of Fox at the same time for most of the Theaters of the day that the great movie could not run. Yes, it is a real movie and certainly a good one, until you see 70 mm. My low rating is to draw attention to all these important details that are not mentioned in most positive reviews. Most of what makes this film epic in scale is much better appreciated in widescreen format, and not in the completely confusing full screen edition offered here. I am usually tolerant of these concessions to the television medium: seeing a widescreen ""Lawrence of Arabia"" on anything smaller than a 60-inch screen is like looking at a colored ribbon stretched out in the middle of the television. So small, it\'s understandable why many people opt for cropped or ""full"" screen versions instead of widescreen versions, but the goal of ""The Big Trail"" is the magnificent GRANDEUR format, a monstrous 70mm image that offers dazzling details of the vast panoramas that make up the backgrounds of the film, these are amazing images, worthy of consideration with the great black and white landscape photography of the best American photographers in the West.If you have a large television screen, you only have to try `` The Big Trail \'\' in widescreen in the `` Special Edition of two discs \'\' of Fox. Once you have seen the movie In its uncut full glory on a good sized screen, you\'ll wonder why Fox released `` The Big Trail \'\' on the 2003 DVD in a `` Full Screen Edtion \'\' very changeable and misleading. So I ordered the widescreen version of `` The Big Trail \'\' and saw a milestone in American film production, something absolutely spectacular as it was intended to be seen. The Big Trail (Special Edition of two discs) My only complaint is Fox We insist on attaching the full-screen DVD to the widescreen DVD and we load two DVDs when most viewers just want to see a version.'",0
"b'While the 2006 Le Mans DVD is similar to previous incarnations, the extremely poor video quality due to a large amount of distortion and pixilation, definitely makes this the worst of the Le Mans DVDs. In terms of content, it is the same: a lot of tests and classifications highlighted with a little more than one hour dedicated to the race itself. However, the poor image quality makes this DVD look almost like a VHS tape. The distortion and pixilation, at times, is horrible and really moves away from the pleasure of watching the race. If you compare this DVD side by side with the Le Mans DVDs covering the 2002 and 2003 races, the 2006 edition is definitely worse. Another complaint is that the DVD covers the tests and highlights of qualifying twice, which adds a lot of repetition to the DVD. ""S running time of 140 minutes.This has been a continuing habit for the producers of this series, which They crowded into this featured show that originally aired on the SPEED channel before their live race coverage at Le Mans.This preview show, which takes a little over an hour to cover the tests and qualification, leads to true The beginning of the DVD, which then includes more tests and qualifying highlights The lack of special features and cameras in the car is another disappointment In the 2005 DVD, producers included cameras with special features for the car for the first time ( even though the DVD had some slight problems of pixilation.) In the 2006 version, there are no special features and the footage of the camera in the car vil is not more than a couple of seconds for each car that shows. It would have been great if there was a complete lap in the car on board the Audi R10 Turbo Diesel. Overall, I would still recommend this DVD to any Le Mans fan as it is the best record of a race in which Audi triumphed with a diesel-powered car for the first time in the 74-year history of the race. He also does a good job showing all the action of the race and all the drama and glamor that make up the annual festival of endurance at the Circuit de la Sarthe.

Although I must admit that some of the special effects generated by computer were impressive, the performance lacked any type of substance. However, what bothered me most was the incredible amount of products placed throughout the film. Was not Mr. Spielberg sure if he would earn enough money at the box office to advertise Aquafina, Pepsi, Gap, Lexus and Nokia throughout the film? In general, I spent two and a half hours in the movie during which I asked myself more than once if all the people who walked through the cinema during the screening of the film, were they as bored as I was?

"b'It\'s my fault that I had higher expectations of this movie, but I guess this movie was not made exactly for guys like me anyway. The acting is fine, the character of Matthew McConaughey Ben and Kate Hudson\'s Andie really just have to act and react. The dialogue does not matter. The character of Kate Hudson always has the top, which is fine for a while, but after an hour it becomes exhausting. She completely invades every aspect of Ben\'s life; We never see Andie\'s world, apart from her two friends and place of work. So, while both characters have a similar agenda, there is a complete imbalance of superiority, and this is the biggest deficiency of the movie for me. He endures all his attempts to ""lose"" him, but all this only produces frustration in Andie and drives her to do more crazy things. As a spectator, you\'re dying to see her fall on her face only once. But that is an illusion. Ben\'s resistance to Andie\'s antics barely entertains me, and Andie\'s total lack of shame does not make her his. Of course both look great, and Hudson smiles positively when he smiles, but man, 112 minutes is a long time to endure this game. I can imagine some people thinking that this movie is great. Girl Power and everything. I do not know . But I think we can agree that the film was conceived as a vehicle for Kate Hudson\'s rise to stardom. This film reminds me a bit of WHAT WOMEN WANT (with Mel Gibson) for a variety of reasons, especially because it was written and produced by women, that in the film world dominated by men is a much needed perspective, but Nancy Myers (the producer / director of What Women Want) is definitely much smarter than the \'brains\' behind How to lose a man in 10 days. You just have to look at the DVD extras to see evidence of this. We met two of the producers, who obviously had facelifts. I\'m serious . It is creepy . They talk about the material as if it were Shakespeare. Then there is the director Donald Petrie, who completely lacks charisma. DOING WITH HIM is so cheap that it\'s probably more fun to watch than most of the movie. While he sits there chatting, a television monitor behind him shoots still images of the film, and an office worker (with her back to the camera) stares at a static PC screen biting her nails and shaking her head. She does this for the duration of the interviews with Petrie. Oh, and did I mention the background music that accompanies the extras? It\'s music from the department store. Or elevator music. Anyone who hate more. I did not bother with the comment. Donald is boring. There are no discarded songs, which is unusual for a comedy. The deleted scenes are really good, Andie shows some honest emotions and we have some quieter private moments between the two protagonists. Look, it started well. It felt like a spongy and harmless romantic comedy, but the romance lasted about 10 minutes. I can summarize my criticism with this observation of director Petrie\'s reason why he was interested in directing the film. He says it was because he discovered that Kate Hudson was attached to that. Aha. So, basically, if the movie works well at the box office, then it will launch And its career in Hudson. I\'m sorry, Petrie, but that\'s not good enough for me.'",0
"b'`` Ring Around the Rosie \'\', starring Gina Philips (`` Jeepers Creepers \'\') and Tom Sizemore (`` Saving Private Ryan \'\'). I was interested in their names, but unfortunately the film is terribly boring, although it lasts less than 90 minutes.Gina Philips plays Karen, a young business woman who inherits a house in a remote place in the countryside, which may or may not be haunted Near the house lives a caretaker played by Tom Sizemore, who may or may not be possessed by something evil. The premise is very familiar, recently used in films like ""The Amityville Horror"", and with the correct direction of the film would be exciting. But soon you will realize that there are no emotions of any kind, not even a surprise for a sudden great sound, in `` Ring Around the Rosie \'\' that presents many recycled fragments of images seen in other thrillers: from rudimentary tricks like shadows moving behind the door, a strange reflection in the mirror, a strange noise at midnight or an unreliable neighbor looking at the protagonist, the heroine tormented by nightmares and her buried memories of the past. The film also features Karen\'s friendly boyfriend (Randall Batinkoff) and her lovely younger sister (Jenny Mollen). The first leaves the house while Karen stays to clean the house; the last one arrives there and what Karen sees and listens begins to become strange. Considering the nature of the conclusion and the suggested history of Karen\'s childhood (which I can not reveal here), there could be some psychological explanations about the strange events that terrify Karen, as in thrillers like \'The Others\'. ""That\'s what I thought about trying not to sleep, but no matter how I try, I can not find one in this disconnected story that is confusing and illogical, if you see a character fall from the window and another character grabs her in his arms As if it were a caricature, you realize that this is not a very good psychological thriller, or maybe I\'m thinking too much, probably this is another badly written horror movie you can find in your rental video store, borrow it and I\'ll regret it later, whatever it is, I was bored, and I can say that with great confidence.'",0
"b""I thought that this movie was amazing. It made me curious at first, hot in the love scenes, sad near the end, and cheerful and optimistic now. Topher Grace is wonderful in this movie, I have to say she's the best so far! I immediately fell in love with his character and I only hope to meet someone like him someday.""",1
"b""The title comes from the idea that serial killers hold graduate degrees in murder, although I thought that the commission of mutual acts would throw them into a post-graduate territory. The 4 assassins mentioned here (Charles Manson, Henry Lee Lucas, Ottis Elwood Toole and Kenneth Bianchi) receive disproportionate coverage. Manson is not seen at all, which can be a blessing considering the crazed interview I've seen him give. Henry Lee Lucas has a short turn, too, but his teammate Ottis Toole has perhaps the most problematic situation. Although convicted and imprisoned for what is said to be 700 incredible murders, with Lucas, Toole gives the impression that he did not do any of them. That does not mean that it is totally crime-free, since it freely admits several acts of arson, but affirms that it confessed the murders based on the information that the police gave, that is to say, that it wanted that it was guilty, reason why it forced them. The study by Kenneth Bianchi, known as the Hillside Strangler, also refers to this behavior that the psychiatrist Martin T Orne defines as sociopathy from the textbook. But while it is easy to believe that Bianchi in his interviews pretends, it is more difficult to accept that Toole is, with his playful character and smiling facade. Maybe that only makes Toole the best actor, since Orne also believes that Toole is a serial killer. Bianchi's initial defense for his murders was a multiple personality disorder, and when Dr. Orne proved he was a phony, denying the testimony of other psychiatrists, Binachi abandoned the farce and was found guilty, although the negotiation of the accusations against his accomplice decreased the number from 14 vicitims to 7. This video was made in 1987 and it is said that Bianchi would be granted parole in the 90's, something that Dr. Orne believes he had a good chance of obtaining, since Bianchi's tactic of not repenting - no memory was winning him alliances. However, while Toole's face reveals an idiotic child entertained with his own game, Bianchi's is the banality of evil, a soft surface on which he can not be trusted. The video concludes with survivors of serial killers, including the mother of Sharon Tate, who meets regularly to supervise probation hearings of convicted murderers. One can only wonder if they could influence the release of Bianchi, since Orne predicts that once this form of obsessive / compulsive behavior is acted on, there is no way to stop it. In Dr. Orne's opinion, no matter how good a prisoner Bianchi was, once he was free, he would start again. Some may feel sorry that these men escaped the death penalty while in states where it was abolished, and the idea that life imprisonment is a worse form of punishment than execution is diluted by conditional release and good conduct conditions. service. This may sound harsh, but Dr. Orne says that there is no civilized method of punishment effective enough to be a decisive factor: the best thing to do is keep the perpetrators isolated from the rest of society. There are no parallels between the murderers seen here, there are no similarities that can explain what triggered their actions. If we can not understand his behavior, we can at least be grateful that he has been detained, at least for a while.""",0
"b'That\'s the way this movie was publicized when it came out in 1981, in the classic sense of universal monster ""a monster movie."" ""As the son of a divorce, I had a weekend dad who would take my sister and me to any movie, regardless of his grade (well, within limits) and this scared us foolishly. theater and having seen the transformation (after seeing the transformation of Lon Chaney Jr. in ""The Wolf Man""), he was familiar with the genre lineage and the example that this film had to fulfill, after having seen ""The Howling"" later (not much later, since the films almost compete with each other theatrically), I was a big fan of Rob Bottin and his mentor, Rick Baker (not to mention the late, great Dick Smith and the master of the splashes, Tom Savini), I was stuck to the screen during one of the best effects of all time, just impressed by what was happening, and I was scared by the credibility of it all when compared to the stop-motion transformation of the Chaney\'s makeup) without mentioning the scene with David Naughton (`` be be Pepper! Drink Dr. Pepper!) And Jenny Agutter in bed (not to mention the shower) ... yowza! (Well, I was 11). The only thing that bothered me about this movie is the lack of what is supposed to be a supremely bloody scene that Landis cut off because it overwhelmed the scene that followed (supposedly the audiences were so disgusted and shocked that they stammered through all the scene of dialogue that followed David waking up in the wolf corral at the zoo): the scene was the expansion of the homeless murders by the wharf, and I do not think it reaches this new DVD version of the movie ( which is a shame, because the gore expanded in Rohocop de Verhoven (Criterion edition) actually plays better than the MPAA-approved version). In any case, this is really great `` monster movie \'\' in every sense of the word ... it\'s coarse, funny, sexy, exploiter in many ways (the book `` Splatter Movies \'\' calls it gore porn) , really a Landis film by dint of joke and orgy of automobile chaos, and offers great acting and casting (even in small roles) like the Pakistani shift worker in the hospital and the punks in the London Underground). Just a fun full movie, with really amazing and Oscar-winning effects (it still looks amazing and credible ... nothing digital is coming! I\'ll say it again: the digital is not there yet ... the transformation looks crusty, painful, horrible and extends the imagination in more ways than one). In short, I\'ve been waiting for this damn DVD forever ... the first edition of the DVD was slop and sold out so fast, I was lucky enough to find a copy of the video store to rent. There are no extras in that ... but this is the only one.'",1
"b""The only bad thing with this image is the title. Adapted from the novel by Thomas Harris `` Red Dragon '', the decision was made to change the title. Probably thinking that most American moviegoers would think it's a Kung Fu movie or something. Probably correct. This also predates the most acclaimed sequel `` The Silence of the Lambs '' by the same author. It's another great Michael Mann movie that oozes style and substance. The style can annoy some people. It is filmed with various unnatural tones, including violet, blue and green. While they may not be realistic, they always seem to fit the scene. Mann and his photographer place cameras in interesting places. Take, for example, the raw white cell of Hannibal Lector (Brian Cox). We see Lector and Will Graham (William Petersen) centered between the same 2 bars, with fast cuts back and forth. Another camera looms over the room. However, this movie is not really about Dr. Lector. It is a serial killer known as The Tooth Fairy (Thomas Noonan, really creepy). While Petersen struggles with his own sanity, he resorts to the killer using his ability to get into the murderer's head. He stole this theme for his television series `` Miami Vice '' about this same time. Another great tactic for which Mann is known is the use of music. Here we get an original score from The Reds and Michel Rubini, not to mention the incredibly cool climate scene with Iron Butterfly's In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.""",1
"b""Once in a blue moon, comes a delight from the public that elevates the spirit. `` Strictly Ballroom '' is one of those movies. Directed in a delicious high-key style by Baz Luhrmann (WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE 'S ROMEO + JULIET, MOULIN ROUGE) in his crazy debut (the first in what would be called the red curtain Trilogy), the film tells the story of a dancer from upper room that is paired with an ugly duckling, left leg, when his nonconformist style wins him the disdain of colleagues more conventional mentality. Together, they give their all and aspire to realize the dream of the title of the National Championship. To say that this movie is incredible would be to fall short. It is one of the most gloriously entertaining and impressive films ever made. The cast is simply magnificent and Luhrmann presents here his style of direction and intelligent and fast editing. He brilliantly uses an opening of documentary style and occasional interludes that help to better understand the adorable characters. It works beautifully! This is definitely the feel-good movie of the decade. It is hypnotic, strange and deeply sincere, a deliciously entertaining multitude delight. A highly recommended!""",1
"b""I love the first two films of Anne of Green Gables. I saw them for the first time on PBS and the original VHS tapes were released by Disney. Sullivan's first DVD releases were of very poor visual and audio quality. This new and expensive set brings together the four films, all in a 16x9 widescreen. I do not like the other two movies, so I'll just comment on the first two. These were originally filmed in 4x3 format, with the television in mind (I read that they may have played theatrically abroad). I'm not an expert, but these new widescreen formats are cut. Then, information is lost with these new transfers. That's too bad? Yes, because I think that the original aspect ratios of these films should be 4x3 (or 1.33: 1), since they were originally issued. Worse still, the quality of the image seems to be so digitally erased that many details that were originally visible are no longer visible. The audio seems to be fine; the default is the original stereo mix 2.0. Interestingly, closed captioning seems to have been done by nitwits. For the first film, the first disc (fortunately, each movie has two discs) has pretty good subtitles. The second album has the subtitle IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS, and is full of errors. Very poor quality! ! At this price, I would not recommend fans buy back these movies if they are already their property. However, as an FYI, I contacted Sullivan Entertainment and was told that they had no plans to release the films in blu-ray.""",0
b'What a waste of money this was. They did not even have Justin singing a song to see if he wanted to buy his other DVD.',0
"b'A sequel to director ""Alien"" by Ridley Scott was inevitable, of course. This traditional horror film set in outer space simply made too much money for the studio to simply leave it alone. Surprisingly, when director James Cameron took over, he was determined to make a different movie instead of just repeating the first one. Therefore, `` Aliens \'\' was adventurous, taking the story in new and exciting directions as a story of action and adventure instead of another horror movie. In fact, several critics feel that `` Aliens \'\' is better than `` Alien. `` But now comes `` Alien 3 `` - as an unnecessary sequel to an important movie as we\'ve seen at some point. The first director David Fincher and four writers have created another horror movie, trying existential allusions to make the alien in this movie ""Moby Dick"" by Ripley. `` But `` Alien 3 `` starts by changing the end of its predecessor and eliminating almost all the characters that matter to us. Fans will remember that Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Hicks, Newt and the Android Bishop escaped in a spaceship at the end of `` Aliens. ""But this movie begins with his expulsion from the ship and his forced landing on a prison planet, which kills everyone except Ripley. On this planet of maximum security, where the lice infestation requires everyone to be bald, Ripley discovers that the only surviving monster is still with them. Soon, she is organizing the prisoners to be alert, but since there are no weapons of any kind on the entire planet, they end up playing hide and seek with the creature for most of the movie. There are many things about problems with this movie, but the worst is its dark and somber motif; the lack of friendly characters; the unpleasantness of the premise of the film, which causes Ripley to finally discover that she has an extraterrestrial queen growing inside her; and a long chase sequence that is so dark and edited so chaotically that it becomes confused. Those who are looking for emotions or some improvement in the first films will be very disappointed. Those who are looking for a headache will have arrived at the right place. And why is it ""Alien 3 (that is, in cubes)"" instead of just ""Alien 3"" or ""Alienz"" or ""Alien: one of those slimy monsters survived after all""? It\'s probably just a trick for writers like me to consider the issue and give the film a little more ink. It worked .'",0
"b'As many critics show, if you love this movie, you will really love it; if you detest him, you will detest him * really *. As I have seen twice, and I am ready to see it again, you can place me firmly in the first category. I have not been transported and moved by a movie since `` The Fountain \'\'. (which evoked similar love or hate responses in the viewers). It requires the voluntary suspension of simplistic cynicism, which I suspect may be a point of friction for some ... but if you are willing to open your mind and your heart even more, you will be amply rewarded. The plot is simple, as it should be: a thread woven through the life of several characters, which takes them through the main events of the 1960s. Wealth comes in the evocation of the times, in the innumerable little ones details spinning around the characters. And most importantly, when everything is said and done, this is a story of love, beautiful and movingly told. If you have ever felt the intense emotions expressed in these beautiful songs, then you will identify with Jude & Lucy, Sadie & JoJo, and all their friends. Not only romantic love, but the genuine love of others as brothers and sisters, all together in this confusing and stimulating world. So, are there uncomfortable moments or scenes too precious for contemporary tastes? Of course! But that really does not matter, because one of the characteristics of the 1960s was the willingness to take ridiculous risks, risk looking foolish, or even falling flat on your face. I\'m glad that Julie Taymor took similar risks here, because it helps capture the sensitivity of that moment, a sensitivity that led to great creativity and innovation. And it\'s not just for that moment. The questions of unnecessary war, of the demonization of the Other, of intolerance and fear of change, of distrusting the imagination, are they not as powerful today as they once were? But although the film is definitely on the side of the counterculture at its best, Julie Taymor does not hesitate to show how even the best idealist intentions can go to dark places, as happens with some protesters who go to bombs. A hymn of peace and love, he is also very familiar with pain and despair. In fact, the film ends with the anthem ""All You Need Is Love"", a song that some consider unreflective. Artifact of naive and antiquated flower power. But I remember something that George Harrison once said, when they asked him if love really * is * all he needs, he answered that even if it is not * everything * that he needs, if he does not have it, then, of what Does the rest serve? Yes, it is a bright cloud, illuminated by the sun, of golden nostalgia in a sense ... but it is also a reminder that there is more to life than fear and darkness, that there is hope even in the midst of madness and the chaos . And in that sense, it\'s a very contemporary film, with a vital message. Very highly, happily recommended!'",1
"b'I was disappointed to get this movie for the price. However, I was happy with the shipment. I highly recommend anyone who is tempted to buy this to save their money and rent it or try to get it really cheap. The movie was not what I expected it to be.'",0
"b""This film was generally overlooked at the time of release. Before Lone Star and Thunderheart, this movie has three incredible things: (1) the cast is stellar. You get Dafoe, in a good-guy role, M Emmett Walsh as a lazy forensic, Mary Elizabeth Mastronantino in an incredible lead role, Sam Jackson (how he figures in the final credits) smashing the landscape, Mickey Roarke in a GOOD performance, and even an ungrateful role not accredited. (2) The plot is much better than No Way Out. With Donaldson directing, you might think it would just be a remake / remuddle, but the plot keeps twisting, and once you think you have it even remotely deciphered, BANG happens something else. (3) The landscape is incredible. The only movie that comes closest to capturing the feeling of New Mexico's landscape is Backtrack, which is also very good. The wide screen adds (although it is fair to ask when NOT), so, if you were like me and did not see this until it comes out on VHS, you will be in luck. Not everything works: you always expect Dafoe to become the coward that is in most of his films from Wild at Heart or Roarke to make little sense, but like Angelheart, he is focused and it is incredible here, but it does not happen. many extras here, unfortunately (maybe there's a director's edition somewhere with more than Mimi Rogers, but as it is, this is an excellent movie - four stars out of five.""",1
"b'I gasped after seeing This Is It in blu-ray. The amount of time, love, passion, ingenuity and effort to achieve the perfection that Michael Jackson put into his work is so inspiring. No wonder he is the king of pop!'",1
"b""Okay, you'd think this is common knowledge, but apparently it's not as common as we all realized. 'Starboard' is right. 'Port' is left. It is obvious from the direction of the helmsman that the director, the producers, the cast and crew of the film are all a group of sailors who deserve to get off with the boat. This is not the only mistake in the movie, nor the most obvious. There are many other problems in this production that have already been discussed: the fact of knowing what will happen before it starts, the team that shoots passengers, the duration of the film, Leonardo DiCaprio, to name a few. While they are not too distracting, if taken together, they make the movie unpleasant for those who do not like to read romantic novels 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Even in that extreme, romance is stupid (for lack of my effort to find a better description). The only saving grace of the whole thing is the set, which is simply spectacular. They did not save any expense building the replica of the boat, and it shows. Two stars for the sets, and nothing more.""",0
"b'A story within a story on a cruise ship: the history of the surface is of a ""seven-year itch"". A formal and respectable British couple, without children, celebrating that volatile anniversary, is advised by an Indian sage (in relation to the husband anyway) that children are a better marriage therapy than a cruise to India. Lust seizes the seemingly conservative Briton perfectly interpreted by Hugh Grant and deceives him. Yes, this happens to men all the time. In this cruise, the British couple runs into the sensual French mermaid and her crippled and old husband narrator who captures her husband Brit to tell his autobiographical novel never cut. And as for the writer\'s inner history and his French obsession, he shows how ""greed"" for hedonistic fantasy can lead to a dark, sadistic or at least regrettable behavior. Suffice it to say that everyone learns this lesson in their own way in the end. A subtle theme here is the representation of the unsuccessful writer, who buys too much in fantasy and tries to make life imitate art until both his life and his art do not reach. any success (this, like lust in seven-year-old male itching) is another truism: failed artists often expose themselves too much to the realism that ultimately causes frustration and failure) as well as telling their story orally to a mere chump on a cruise who completely loses the point and is ready to take advantage of his perfectly respectable life for a brief and scandalous trist in the same way that he turned the cripple into an odious and abominable loser. Like the song of Homer\'s Siren (who was also crossing the Mediteranian, right?) Vangelis\'s great score too, capturing romance and tragedy in one theme.'",1
"b""As another critic, I can not load the DVD into my Toshiba SD-1200 player. I own a lot of DVDs and I've seen a lot of rentals and I have not had any problems like this before now.

"b""This review is about blu-ray only, as there are many reviews here in the movie and there are only so many ways to say that the movie is great. I was a bit skeptical about this blu-ray because I had read that it was not a great update to the Jane Doe edition. Technically, that might be true, but the truth is that it is the best that Fletch has ever seen and that could be as good as ever. I do not know if they can invent a format that could give life to a mid-'80s comedy that was not originally intended / budgeted to be a visual spectacle. Yes, this movie does not look like The Departed in blu-ray, but it's an improvement over the DVD and that's all you can ask for. For $ 10, it's hard to beat and for me it's a no-brainer if you're a fan of the movie.""",1
"b""I would recommend this movie for adults and children alike. It has something of interest for all age groups. There are beautiful and impressive southwestern landscapes, as the story takes place in the desert of southwestern Arizona, in Navajo lands. There is also a story about two children who lost their goat and believe that they have strayed into a canyon known as & quot; Cougar Canyon & quot; a place that is supposed to be haunted, according to the Navajo legend. They must go and look for the goat, of course, and they are harassed by many dangerous mishaps before successfully fulfilling their mission. However, the true stars of this film, in addition to the beautiful landscape, are the excellent photography of the desert wildlife in their natural habitat. There is a battle between a badger and a puma, or wildcat, as it is more commonly known, with a surprise ending. The close-ups of a diamond rattlesnake are incredible, and the narration is excellent, too. This movie is reminiscent of the old Disney nature documentary series that used to appear on television years ago, in the 70s. I enjoyed it immensely, and I am a senior citizen, but I can see that it would also attract children, since they are generally fascinated with wild creatures such as rattlesnakes, wild cats, black bears, etc. In its natural environment It is actually very educational, especially for us the inhabitants of the city. I can not say enough good things about this movie, you'll just have to see it for yourself.""",1
"b""The critic who has it in these pages is the one who calls the fact that Jonathan Larson conceived 'Rent' as more opera (using 'La Boheme' as inspiration), not a musical. And what that means is that the connection dialogue is sung at the stage of the voice, it is not talked about as a dialogue. Then, to see Jesse L. Martin forced to speak a dialogue like `` I reconnected the ATM in the Food Emporium '' when you know it is killing him not to sing it and he is also killing all the Rent fans when he listens to him restricted Simply speaking the words ... well, it's a major mistake because it hits the flow and energy of Larson's work great blows. Other concerns: * The first half of the work is redesigned largely rolled-by-shot. Then, strangely (given the fidelity in the first half), the second half deviates violently from the original. The director Columbus loses too much time organizing `` Take me or leave me '' in an unintentional way. Fun, no doubt, but the additional 5 to 10 minutes you have crossed out here could have been used to keep the scenes deleted intact. * The deleted scenes are not trivial issues: 'Rent' is a difficult story to follow for the unitiated. Each of those scenes could have helped explain the story. * Surely one of the reasons to support `` Take me or leave me '' was to get more Idina Menzel there. [Menzel (the original Elephaba in `` Wicked '' and the original Maureen here) has risen to Broadway royalty, so who can blame Columbus? ] But, if so, why leave aside 'Happy New Year? 'who has a fair amount of Maureen? * The deleted scenes end up dismissing the Anthony Rapp brand, which is unfortunate because he is the voice and the guiding thread of the work. Leaving his' 3D IMAX from my mind ... that is poetic ... that 'pathetic' number is an important omission, both for Rapp as an actor and for anyone trying to follow the movie: this is the key piece that puts things in perspective for the viewer in time. Why would Larson strive to put lines in Rapp's monologue as `` Christmas ... last year's Christmas Eve '' He is framing the scenes for us. This would be a three star review, but I will go for four because of the redeeming nature of the beautiful documentary about the Larson family: it is very powerful. It is obvious that the family is still suffering deeply 10 years after its loss.""",1

James Brolin plays the husband, a tough guy with a lot of hair. Margot Kidder is the wife, who reacts with large, open eyes every time she witnesses a ghost, hallucination, atrocity, etc. Most scares are doors that open or something, looking at something, and then the music gets very loud, and then we see people\'s eyes, closer, and then, da-da!

After repeated attacks on herself, in desperation, she looks for a protector and finds a mysterious Russian officer (Evgeny Sidikhin) with a tormented past. Interested in it but reluctantly, he accepts, and what follows becomes a history of relationships and common ground in the midst of hell on earth. Without wishing to justify them, the writers, to a certain extent, show both sides of the conflict. The Russians, in general, long for their families, hate the war that dragged them there and tell horrible memories of the atrocities that the Germans committed in their homeland. Paying evil for evil does not compensate for your actions in any way, but I suppose it brings a kind of balance and understanding to the story. Fortunately, the assaults are shown in a non-free manner, and there is a nudity scene to make a point, but that's all for the graphic shooting. But one understands the message. The whole movie is depressing. I think the only hope that comes from the heroine's desire to survive, to maintain her sanity and a sense of decency, come what may. The written epilogue is almost as disturbing. The response of societies is to hide their past instead of dealing with it. A hard movie I will not see it again.""",1
"b'When I think of Disney, I think about leaving the real world for 90 minutes. A departure from the routine of everyday life. That includes the comedy and the merry Disney animation. Have you ever seen Toy Story? Ok, Dinosaur is 90 minutes of dino-desperation. Each time brings more death and depression. Yes, there is a happy ending, but did I even want to get there? Of course, the animation and the scenes were very beautiful, but this was a departure from what people know about Disney. I was disappointed with this one.'",0
"b'I could talk a lot about this movie forever, but I will not! In my opinion, the best musical ever produced, \'The Music Man\' is something that is heard in my native Britain. I caught him when he appeared on television in the early hours of the morning about 15 years ago and I\'ve loved him ever since. Robert Preston IS Harold Hill and shows that he is a fantastic screen actor whose film credits are very few, although if you have not seen him yet, check out \'Victor / Victoria\'. Shirley Jones gives a performance that, after \'Oklahoma! \'and\' Carousel \', shows that she CAN act! All supporting players are excellent too, with an emphasis on Paul Ford and Hermione Gingold (again, few movie appearances) such as the Shinns, Pert Kelton as Mrs. Paroo and The Buffalo Bills as the All-singing All-singing School Board. Harmonizing Much better as a movie than as a set, Meredith Willson\'s ode to childhood in Iowa is perfectly captured by Morton DaCosta, whose direction is as scenic as that of ""Auntie Mame,"" but which fits very well with the slightly unreal nature of the plot. The highlights of the music are practically all songs, but a short list would include \'Trouble\', \'76 Trombones\', \'Marian the Librarian\' and \'The Sadder But Wiser Girl\'.'",1

"b""`` 28 Days Later '' is easily the best horror movie I've seen in a long time. What impressed me most was how smart he was; that is, the suspension of disbelief was very manageable. Once I get over the idea that a virus affects someone that way and spreads so quickly, the rest of the plot makes perfect sense to me. The few questions I had were easily found out about a beer with my friends. When I found out they were doing a sequel, I was very excited and in fact I dialed my calendar. The opening night, the first time I left work, I was there. Three hours later I was banging my head on a table and wondering if there was enough beer in the world to make sense of what I had just seen. `` 28 Weeks Later '' should become a case study in film schools about how to take all the good of an amazing movie and leave it aside for the continuation. As mentioned in other reviews, the gaps in the plot are huge and implacable. My `` favorites '' are: 1) the children simply leave the safe area and we even see soldiers in the watchtower who let them go, 2) no one is monitoring or watching the infected survivor (but not symptomatic), 3) her husband is foolish enough to kiss her, and 4) no matter how many blocks of the city the child is frailly braked, his dad `` Raged-Out '' appears quickly and focuses on attacking him and him alone. He was especially anxious to see the virus spread among the crowd, as was reported in the first film. Nop. When it hits the fan at the train station, what happens? The lights go out and they give us a lot of fast and stroboscopic shots. Gee, thanks. Unless you're epileptic, there's nothing scary about that. I give these two stars mainly because I could not give the `` Days '' seven. Well, let's call it one for the opening sequence and one for the end.

"b'Based on a true story, CALENDAR GIRLS by Nigel Cole is a whimsical, moving, but sometimes trivial film. Trivial only in that there are many moments in which nothing of real importance happens, and the crisis points are predictably sentimental and exaggerated. But a lovely cast still manages to entertain. The idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bmore than 50 women to the natural is difficult to understand, but these women are so elegant and attractive, and the calendar is presented with such good taste that you can not stop catching when the calendar becomes an international success. Helen Mirren, long since won an Oscar, takes her role as Chris, the instigator of the calendar, to a wonderful fruit. Ciaran Hinds (Sum of all fears, Lara Croft Cradle of Life) is very good as her husband, who tells a sneaky journalist that causes a break in their marriage. Julie Walters (Oscar nominee for years Educating Rita) agrees with Mirren in his role as widow, whose death inspires the calendar. The other women, Annette Crosbie and Penelope Wilton especially, are all very successful in their performances. It is not a film that shakes the earth, but it is stimulating because it shows that beauty is not relegated to young people, perhaps young people at heart.'",1
"b""Before watching The Girl Next Door, I expected it to be a typical obscene teen sex movie. After watching it, it has become one of my favorite movies, if not my favorite. It's a love story and a comedy in one. Emile Hirsch plays Matthew Kidman, a high school student who is an excellent student and a good boy, but he's a little nerdy and has not done anything memorable. throughout high school. This changes when she meets her new neighbor next door, Danielle, played by Elisha Cuthbert. Danielle is beautiful and Matthew instantly falls in love with her. Shortly after seeing her, he sees her undressing through his window and can not stop looking. Danielle catches him looking at her and gets angry at first, but soon it seems that she has also fallen in love with him. Danielle is a former porn star, whom Matthew does not discover until her friend Eli (played by Chris Marquette) shows her a video with her on it. To complicate things further, Danielle's former producer / ex-boyfriend, Kelly (played by Timothy Olyphant), appears one day and wants Danielle to return to the adult film business. At first, Kelly and Matthew get along, but this changes when Matthew tries to get Danielle out of the porn industry, something Kelly does not like. Eli and Kelly are two characters that really steal the show in this movie. Eli is the friendly nerd of Matthew's high school who is horny all the time and obsessed with sex and hot women. He had some of the funniest lines in the whole movie. Kelly (the pornography director who used to work with Danielle and also used to go out with her) is the great and wise girl who made me believe in almost every scene she was in. He could not decide whether to love or hate him: he is a great and fun boy when he and Matthew are friends, but when Matthew angers him, he becomes psychotic and violent. I do not want to give too much. in this movie, but Danielle makes Matthew do things he never imagined he would do. It really is a case of attraction of opposites: Matthew falls in love with Danielle's wild adventurous side, and Danielle falls in love with Matthew's innocence and purity. In several scenes, you can see in the background that Danielle is a good person, that she does not really want to be in the porn business, and that she really cares about Matthew. Matthew feels the same about Danielle and puts herself in many risky situations for her. This movie was so moving that I cried a couple of times and I do not cry easily. However, there were also such funny parts that I could not stop laughing (mainly the scenes with Eli and Kelly). Definitely worth looking at and not being well evaluated.""",1
"b'I do not understand why other countries have the 4 seasons available and the United States does not. This is a great show and should be available here. I have most of the shows recorded on TV, but I would love to have a box of this program.'",0
"b'This is still one of my favorite shows to this day. I really enjoy watching the episodes again and again. This is the penultimate season and it is one of the best seasons. Obviously over the years, children are growing and maturing and that generates some interesting situations. In the episode Fast Friends, Steph goes out with children who smoke and make her feel pressured to do the same. I also like The Apartment, where Steve buys an apartment and DJ sleeps on the couch. Danny finds her (after arriving home late) and gets very angry. Full House is such a good show that I\'m sure today\'s young children would still like it, and ""children"" like me still like it because I grew up seeing that. There has never been a cooler (or cuter) guy than Uncle Jesse, and the love between the whole family is great and fun to watch. This is one of the best seasons and any fan should definitely have this in their collection.'",1
"b""You would think that Hollywood would have no problem making a movie about Hollywood. Think again. It is true that there have been some excellent images in which Hollywood sees itself. The oldest one I can think of is 1937 's A Star is Born, which was remade like an even better movie in 1954. 1950 Sunset Boulevard is one of the best movies ever made, and a few years later Singin' came along. in the Rain, a classic musical. However, over the years, the industry has produced more bad films about itself than good ones. America's Sweethearts is somewhere in between. Its beginning is quite promising, but it wavers and goes downhill after that. Lee [Billy Crystal] is a Hollywood press agent with big problems. His boss, Dave [Stanley Tucci], needs him to promote the latest movement starring Gwen Harrison and Eddie Thomas [Catherine Zeta-Jones and John Cusack]. The couple used to be the most popular and popular married couple in the United States, and the public flocked to see their films. Now that they are about to divorce and can not stand the sight of others, they are cash poison. Lee must find a way to convince the press that Gwen and Eddie will be together again without letting the two stars realize what they are up to. He requests the help of Gwen's sister, Kiki [Julia Roberts], who is not only resented by the way Gwen orders her, but is also secretly in love with Eddie. Then there is the problem of the movie itself. All the study has seen is the opening credits. The director [Christopher Walken] does not want to show it until he has made some changes. These modifications will result in a film quite different from the one the studio paid $ 86 million to make. Reading the previous synopsis makes me see how funny and insightful the American Sweethearts could have been. The plot leaves ample space for farce and satire, but the writers did not take the opportunity. Instead of being brilliant, fragile and insightful, history is, on the other hand, pretty, cloying and docile. Most of the possibilities that Hollywood laughs at itself are useless. So is Julia Roberts. As much as I finally come to respect her, I do not think she's right in a simple Jane role. In addition, she has made the ugly duckling in a swan routine too many times before. The film is primarily a vanity project for Billy Crystal, who also produced it, and for director Joe Roth, who used it to launch his new company, Revolution Studios. They were probably afraid to bother the Hollywood establishment too much, of which they are a part. If your mind wanders while you watch a movie, it usually means that it is not grabbing you. There are several scenes in America's Sweethearts where a character says something and everyone in the room is speechless. I started thinking about this. In all my life, I never met anyone who said something that made all the listeners tremble, and I've met some pretty hot people. This is something that happens only in movies. Then, I began to list in my head other things that you only see on celluloid. Before I knew it, the movie was over.""",0
"b""The shelter generated a lot of controversy after its launch, and has generated a set of generally dizzy audience reactions. Many have responded with hatred towards the violent and unyielding nature of the film. My problem is not in violence. I can not connect with the first half of the movie, which deals mainly with the silly behavior of men while traveling backpacking through central Europe. All of that becomes a long wait to see what is expected in the second half, and it provides very little accumulation of what we will eventually have to endure. All the violence in the film is hard, personal and disturbing. It is not entertaining, but in a broader sense, quite interesting. It makes you wonder about the world, and what dark places can exist where anything or someone can be bought for the right price. This DVD contains some pretty good features, and overall a really good set of extras, including a featurette that is almost completely about the inspiration and reaction of the movie, and how much of it is based on reality. Eli Roth is undoubtedly an intelligent man, and he is willing to tell a message, not only of shock, but because of the rough and stark nature of the film, it is difficult to digest, and in general it is too uncomfortable to be really memorable . Maybe there's a bit of truth in Hostel.""",0
"b'TETSUJIN 28 is a Japanese live-action film based on manga series Mitsuteru Yokoyama, best known in the west for its 1963 animated black-and-white adaptation that aired on American television in 1966 under the title `` Gigantor \' \' ""Here are some pretty spectacular scenes of two giant robots, Tetsujin 28 and Black Ox, that roam the streets of Tokyo and make a dent in their horizon, including a heartbreaking move where Black Ox leans back at the top of the Tower of Tokyo, there\'s even a lot in which Black Ox throws the disabled Tetsujin into the Diet building (Parliament), these sequences are quite exciting and well done, as if the cameras were on the scene and understood the action as it developed. , the two battles of later robots do not deliver the goods, the blows thrown are quite weak and there is not much movement in the fights, the robots never fly and they fight in the air, although, in the final encounter, both have that power. The original animated series had a giant robot action much more satisfying than we have here, even worse, the young man, Shotaro, who has been appointed to operate the Remote device that controls Tetsujin, he never seems to really want to do it. He is weak and scared for most of the movie. When he finally approaches the plate and accepts his role in the 90th minute, too long for us to have to wait, it is not particularly effective. While the child playing Shotaro can offer a realistic description of how a ten-year-old would react under the circumstances, I must confess that he was not exactly looking for realism. I wanted the boy to be completely in love and eager to control that powerful robot and send him into furious combat to end the depredations of Black Ox. Exactly how Shotaro (or `` Jimmy Sparks \'\' as he was known in `` Gigantor \'\') behaved in the original manga and anime. Or the heroes of the child in `` Johnny Sokko and his flying robot \'\' and the Gamera movies of the 60s. These new Japanese heroes are really weak when they are put to the test (see also Toru in GAMERA THE BRAVE and Tadashi in THE GREAT YOKAI WAR, two films also made in 2005, and both also reviewed in this site). What does this say about the next generation of Japanese heroes? At least Ash from `` Pok & eacute; mon \'\' still knows what to do in the face of a threat. However, I liked one aspect of the movie. I enjoyed watching two idols of Japanese pop music in the cast. The oldest is Hiroko Yakushimaru, who was popular in the 1980s and starred in a movie I remember called SAILOR SUIT AND MACHINE GUN (1981). She plays Shotaro\'s mother and is quite beautiful. The other is one of my favorite J-pop singers of all time, Yuko Nakazawa, one of the founding members of Morning Musume, who plays a young police detective assigned to the case. They give her her short dark hair and a simple blue navy suit, clearly an attempt to detract from her usual glamor, but she has a lot to do and it\'s always exciting to see her in action. Another key female character is Mami Tachibana (played by Yu Aoi), a robotics expert from MIT recruited to help restore Tetsujin 28 after a disastrous battle from the start. She is young and brave and looks good in uniform and beret while befriending young Shotaro. Akira Senju\'s score is pleasant and melodic and keeps things animated when the film slows down (which happens frequently). In fact, I also have the soundtrack CD. The final music becomes a repetition of the male choir singing the song `` Tetsujin 28 \'\' of 1963, accompanied by shots of the original manga, which is much more action-packed than anything in this film. The Pioneer / Geneon DVD does not offer credits in English anywhere, except what is in the DVD box.'",0

The eight-year-old girl who saw him to the end (he always does, no matter what!)

"b'This was a very interesting movie. In fact, it is NOT prohibited in Singapore. I saw this movie while I was living there and it was a great relief. Although the film focuses on street thugs, the general theme is the forgotten people of Singapore who can not be doctors, lawyers or government cronies. Students are optimized at a very early age and a few bad tests mean that they are grouped with faeces.

"b""If you liked the first, this is up to your alley.I say that especially because of the tone (darker than many mainstream movies), the hidden nature and the unusual imagery have a tendency to put some moviegoers off. But if you just want to see a movie about a demon that was raised by humans to fight evil, this is a great movie for you. Guillermo del Toro's style of direction is very kinetic and fluid. This helps keep the pace of the movie, preventing it from appearing to be dragging. The scenes flow very well from one to the other (which is also done very well with some wipes and creative overlays). The real attraction of this film, however, is Hellboy and the team that was offered to him. Ron Perlman is the absolutely perfect Hellboy. His delivery of the lines is perfect to create a scathing, but ultimately adorable (and loving) character. He has an ironic humor about him that makes the Hellboy character something we can all identify with. We have all had moments when we feel less appreciated. We have all felt like the strange unwelcome. However, despite all the incentives that he has to give up on defending these human beings, he continues to do so because that is what his `` father '' taught him to do.Of course Abe and Liz are here too, and Doug Jones and Selma Blair do a wonderful job of portraying their respective characters. But this is not your movie. However, it is interesting to see that one of the elements of the story of the first film is turned around to portray the other side in this one when the team encounters the angel of death. In summary, as I said before, if you liked the first one, this is just your type of movie. I hope to see what Del Toro has in mind for the third movie. (Of course, we'll have to wait for `` The Hobbit '' to end first).""",1

Well, I\'ll admit, `` Alone in the Dark ""It\'s not in my best movies of all time, but it\'s not in my worst movie list either."" It can be directed by Uwe Boll, who is considered by many to be the worst director of all time, but if all of Boll\'s other films are like that, then Boll has been underestimated, because I\'ve seen many films that are much worse than this one ( for example, `` The Stepford Wives remake \'\'). The script is based on a video game, which gives `` video game \'\', moving from level to level, feel that you get with many movies of this type (like `` Resident Evil \'\' or `` Doom \'\'), but that did not discourage me so much as to want to go out and play the game. . Not being a player, this was my first encounter with `` Alone in the Dark \'\', and I found that the story was interesting enough to keep my interest in the length of the movie. The performance is unequal in quality. Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff (as another government agent) give decent shows, but Tara Reid is as unconvincing as she is a scientist who actually contributes to the entertainment value of the film. My main criticism is that some of the battle scenes are too long. There is a fight scene around the 1 hour mark that comprises about 15 minutes of people firing at monsters with very little dialogue, which became tedious after a while. Despite that, I still liked the movie and would be prepared to see it again.'",0

"b""While for me `` Up, Down '' is still the best series of theater masterpieces of all time, this one is very close. Gemma Jones is excellent as Louisa Trotter, the cockney / hotel cook who never loses her sense of common sense nor her strong cockney accent even after becoming host to Richian and Famous of Edwardian England. The previous episodes focus on Louisa's rise from the assistant cook to the mistress of the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII). But most of the series refers to acts at the Bentinck Hotel, an exclusive and private property in London owned and run by Louisa. With few exceptions, one's family must appear in Debrett 's Peerage for at least 100 years before one can reserve a room in the Bentinck. And yet, Louisa's selectivity is not so much a reflection of snobbery on her part as of her passionate commitment to be the best at whatever she does. The entire series is rich in characters and incidents, and in fact, Jones / Louisa is very much in the background in several of the episodes. But she is unquestionably the dominant and dominant character in this series.

"b'It could be said that this is the most fun movie of Vacation. Years later, the real test of a good comedy is howling about the movie, and `` Christmas Vacation \'\' is more than that for me. But this works the other way around: instead of the Griswolds, prone to disasters, traveling abroad to places like Europe or Wally World, they are anchored to the starting line since the calendar marks the Christmas days. Obviously, Chevy Chase is in its element to repeat this time his role as Clark, the well-meaning but hopelessly awkward matriarch, who naturally goes overboard creating ""the perfect Christmas"". The dependably good Beverly D\'Angelo is here as well as Clark\'s support wife to whom the annoying relatives, the whining children and their hurting wives press their buttons. The late John Hughes completes the script full of Christmas satires and references, punched with the brand `` Lampoon \'\' slapstick and lowbrow humor. Okay, sometimes the humorous tanks, but it is a nobler effort than the previous unequal ""Holidays in Europe"". This only challenges you not to laugh when the efforts of the Griswolds to have ""the best Christmas"" turn into a long train accident, which can tickle the funny bone of any ""Scrooge"". Look for familiar faces Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki (the latter currently in the hit sitcom `` The Big Bang Theory \'\') as the Griswold children; a pre-Seinfeld Julia Louise-Dreyfuss as half of the snobby yuppies neighbors who suffer at the hands of Clark; and Doris Roberts, Diane Ladd and William Hickey are some of the problematic family members who come to visit us. But in reality it is Randy Quaid\'s reprisal for the pathetic and mischievous cousin Henry Eddie who steals every scene in which he finds himself. If you want a serious version of a Holiday classic, look at `` It\'s a Wonderful Life \'\'; If you want to laugh hard and often, definitely look at this!'",1

"b""After reading the wonderful `` Doc '' book for the book club, my husband and I saw `` Tombstone '' a few days ago, and `` Wyatt Earp '' last night, in preparation for the next club's meeting week. For all those who say that there is some controversy over which film is better, I can end the controversy: `` Tombstone '' is better. Seeing `` Wyatt Earp '' was like watching a squeaky community theater (no offense to the community theater) of opening scenes with Wyatt (Kevin Costner, with his anachronistic hairdo and long hair) drinking a cup of steaming coffee like the cauldron of a witch, as if the stagehands put a piece of dry ice in the cup. With the exception of the excellent Gene Hackman as the father of Earp, the performance of the male protagonists is silly, or melodramatic, or wooden, or incredibly, all three at the same time. I just saw the strictly controlled and super-masculine interpretation of Kurt Russell by Wyatt Earp in `` Tombstone '', Kevin Costner's performance on the same character reminded me a bit of Forrest Gump, no offense to Forrest Gump, crossed with Costner The character of `` Dances With Wolves '' (the same hairstyle). I love Dennis Quaid, but after seeing the definitive portrayal of Doc Holliday's Val Kilmer in `` Tombstone '', just a few days before seeing Quaid's version in `` Wyatt Earp '' it was probably completely unfair to Dennis Quaid and his great sunglasses, which did not even come close to me. I LOVE the westerns, but this film mounted on a clich\xc3\xa9: a tight blow of the bottle just before a bullet explodes, anyone? - It made me roll my eyes. To sweeten the deal, it lasts more than three hours! Recommendation: Observe `` Tombstone '' instead.""",0

It was more than good. Unless you are interested in a ghost that is so terrible that it makes you laugh, DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE! It is a total disaster! Movie Rayne is nothing like his video game counterpart. The fight scenes were slow, nothing at all like the fluidity of the game. And do not make me start with spilled blood ... I've seen better settings in a haunted house. Nothing was done realistically, and the ten-minute summary at the end of the movie (which was done for some reason that I'll never understand) just shows how sloppy it is. The acting was not great either, and the brief sex scene ... let's say I found myself laughing at most of this mess. Unnecessarily, the plot was also missing (and that's very simple). If you want a vampire movie, pick up the `` Underworld '' movies. If you are a fan of `` BloodRayne '' looking for something to satisfy your fandom, play the game again.

"b'The Italian Job is the best movie ever made, without a doubt. In general, I agree with Leonard Maltin, but sometimes it is off the scale and without doubt it is in this case. Well, you may feel that the characterization is poor, but they are meant to be stereotypes. This movie was ironic before Kevin Williamson and his class were born. It is worth knowing that the censors of the United Kingdom in 1968 did not allow the publication of any film that made it appear that crime pays, so the end was linked to that condition. If you only buy an Amazon video sometime (and that would not be good, they have a wide variety of good quality movies, could I recommend The Quiet Man, for example?) Do it here.'",1

"b'In a few words: style on substance. There are some excellent sequences, but that is all that this film seems to be, well planned and executed sequences, but with nothing consistent sticking the whole set. The `plane near the accident and the last minute of rescue \'is performed extremely impressive and the machine gun ammunition that hits Supe\'s chest followed by the bullet in the eye is magnificent. My jaw was dropping and I almost wanted to cheer up. That\'s what Superman is about: watching him defeat the bad guys in new, attractive and even fun ways. But that\'s where the fun ended. As what Superman is not about is to love children and ridiculous heroic shots with kryptonite. I find that both are so terribly implausible that both should be ridiculed. As Brodie (skilfully played by Jason Lee in Kevin Smith\'s Mallrats) points out, ""It\'s impossible! Lois Lane could never have Superman\'s baby."" Do you think the fallopian tubes could handle your sperm? sexual intercourse, he probably unloads a load like a shotgun blast ... through his back. ""So, other than Lois Lane being alive after intercourse, then it would be impossible for a human being to conceive and bring the child to term. of a foreigner. ""Do not forget that just because Clark Kent looks and apparently acts like a human, he is an alien, he is a completely different species, and completely different species can not mate, just think of the havoc it would cause in the animal kingdom if a lion falls in love and mates with a crocodile or a guinea fowl The other issue that makes me tremble with anger is the cretin concept that Superman is physically capable of to rocket a whole continent of kryptonite towards outer space. As the internet blogger dpogue21 expresses it so skillfully (much better than me, so thank you, digegue) in his immediate criticism, `` My next big complaint [is] that Superman raises a continent made of kryptonite into outer space. You do not have to be a Simpson-type comic to point out what\'s wrong with that. I do not know how many comics Bryan Singer has read, but when Superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite, he barely has the strength to stay on his feet. Whoever had the idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bblowing up a large island made out of its greatest weakness in space, has nothing to do with any project related to Superman. The concept is as ridiculous as making a Dracula movie where the title character has a stake in his heart and still manages to fly a spaceship made of garlic in the sun. Why does not it just cause Superman to eat kryptonite? He can eat it and then brush his teeth with it, and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajamas. That is no more absurd than taking it to a continent of kryptonite in space and then falling powerless through the atmosphere without burning in the reentry or splashing the entire central park when it falls to the ground. \'\' I need to say more? I do not think so. ** [...]'",0

The first time I saw it was ""It\'s okay"", but times 2-10 I still see something new every time. This has become one of my favorite movies. It all comes down to what was a romance, a success story, full of emotion. I recommend this movie as a sweet entertainment. You will feel the emotion throughout the entire movie. Give credit to the actors and do not blame them for a less than perfect script, they did the best with what they were given. Max Beesley is dynamic, throughout the film his eyes only tell the underlying story.'",1

Bellini in some kind of office loft of the big city, the characters, the action in total disagreement with the Romanesque bel canto, the opera reduced to the near farce. It could have been saved by a higher song, but even that is missing. It\'s almost as if the singers were asking themselves: `` What the hell is this nonsense and why are we here? ""Every operatic performance should be a tribute to the composer, but in this case it is nothing more than a reverence to the director and his obvious need to be seen as bold, scandalous and inventive."" One can only shudder at the thought of what he has in store for him. Future performance of the opera (if there is one) Can we wait for his Norma set in Detroit, a metaphor for the collapse of the downtown? I would not be surprised.'",0

"b""From the trailers and the presence of Julia Roberts in the cast, I entered CLOSER waiting for a light romantic comedy. (My preconceived ideas have not been so shattered since I saw Bambi's mother being shot by hunters in the Saturday marathon!) CLOSER opens when Alice (Natalie Portman), a New York stripper on a visit to London, she is stunned by a car after she has looked to the left instead of to the right walking off the sidewalk. She is taken to the hospital by a stranger, Dan (Jude Law), an aspiring writer with whom he begins a relationship of coexistence. Then, Dan sits down for a formal portrait of the photographer Anna (Julia Roberts), whom he hits unsuccessfully. Later, Larry (Clive Owen), a dermatologist, meets Anna, whom she marries, and then divorces after discovering that she had recent sexual relations with the once despised Dan. In the rebound and in need of physical comfort, Larry looks for Alice, who now strips naked in a London strip club after leaving Dan, whom he had previously met at one of Anna's photographic exhibitions. But Dan is still in love with Alice and is emotionally devastated from having sex with Larry. Is this dirty or what? (The timeline is dark, apparently all this happens in a couple of years.) CLOSE is a movie, painful to watch, sexual manipulation, possession and obsession in which the four main characters inflict emotional cruelties on each other. It's not a party to spend the evening at the movies with your old mom. The language is sexually graphic and, in a sequence of scenes on the London strip, visually obscene. CLOSER is, however, one of the best films of 2004. Julia Roberts is perhaps the biggest surprise, since it shows that she can transcend radically, even beyond ERIN BROCKOVICH (2000), her usual cute roles; I was very impressed. It would be difficult to choose the lead and the supporting parts of this movie. The four (Portman, Law, Roberts, Owen) have approximately the same screen time (although I was not following the stopwatch). Anyone, or all of them, could get an Oscar nomination. I started to doze about a quarter of the movie, but then I woke up almost with a start when I realized that CLOSER is an exceptional adult movie, without visually explicit. Sex or violence, which brutally shows adults in dysfunctional relationships behaving in the worst way. Truly, as indicated by a line in KINSEY: '' Sex is a dangerous game. If you're not careful, you can cut yourself wide. ''""",1

"b""From the end of the 50s, a series of country music films was produced, perhaps in reaction to the successful series of rock films of the year B from the same period. Most of them presented some kind of argument that involved rubes and got into all sorts of problems. But these films were not just the crazy extravaganza of hilarious hillbillies; They were the extravagant and funny hillbillies that had the famous stars of country music as friends. In other words, the weak plots and the failing movie stars were just an excuse to show a lot of stars of country music of the time. Many of the performances were synchronized, although some were recorded live. The sound of Nashville, which was recorded in 1969, was different. Perhaps influenced by the Pennebaker documentaries of the time, this film did not have flimsy or scathingly cheesy plots. Instead, it was a serious look at Nashville and the country's reigning stars of the day. It is well filmed, it is meticulous and fascinating to watch. Much of it was filmed at the Grand Ole Opry, but you also get invaluable material, such as Loretta Lynn playing for a lunch crowd of people from the radio and the record company, the shy brother Oswald singing a Mountain Dew choir out of Record Ernest Tubb's shop, an essay by the newcomer Mother Earth (with Tracy Nelson), a performance outside the house of Shelby Singleton, a recording session with Doug Kershaw and a young and beardless Charlie Daniels, and much more. There are also many great images of Nashville. All the performances are exceptional, and the film does an excellent job of capturing the essence of country music at that time: artists, fans and industry people. I've been waiting a long time for this to appear on DVD!""",1
"b""Action films remind me of the true beauty of movies, how a story can be told through visual arrangement and movement through the frame, rather than the motionless dialogue and conversation of two immobile actors. Those films are like filmed plays, while others are inspired by their black silence & amp; White roots, tell stories without words. Road Warrior contains one of the best examples of this: such a small moment, a minor obstacle overcome, but that dances boldly across the screen like a painter. Here is the magic, shot by blow. Halfway through the final chase sequence, a red hotrod approaches the back of Max's big truck with the intention of killing him. In a shot that has been copied many times, Max leaves the cockpit and pushes his shotgun against the camera: forced perspective, moving to the right and then to the left, back and forth zigzagging across the screen. The bad guy's head explodes like a firecracker, and we receive a shout of joy from Max's wild wolf friend, an animalistic reaction to the violence ironically given by a child raised by animals. Now we have a series of jumps. cuts that tell the little story that the red car lost control and hit other bad vehicles. That little story closes with the famous and almost peaceful shot of a man who turns on his head in a horizontal fall, again in forced perspective flying towards the camera. Now another series of jump cuts as we go back to the red hotrod and we struggle to keep away from Max's huge wheels. In a beautiful movement game, the car dances in front of Max's truck, coming and going in front of Max and our screens like a dangling carrot, until we have a third masterful chance of forced perspective: the camera approaches the grill of the truck, then moves up and into the cab in Max, when Max finally ends the misery of this car by driving it into a gasoline explosion and pieces of metal. Such sick and twisted beauty ... Did you know that George Miller, the director of Road Warrior, also directed Babe?""",1
"b""The Ruff Ryders have become street legends in multiple ways throughout the Hip Hop culture and have set a quality standard in delivering a product that is often harsh and does not apologize at hardcore levels.

All this for the glory of saying that you can go for BLOCKS with Wheelee in your mind. Wink's comment and the few personalities of comic characters he has created for himself are fun but short.

"b""It only takes a few minutes to see how horrible this is. The movie starts with some jets involved in a high-speed transcontinental race.

It would be a bit dangerous, I imagine. Well, Grant's plane is filled with fuel with another plane while they are in the direct flight path of the other racing jets. What happens ? Duh ... there is a horrible collision and three pilots (along with 11 spectators ... huh?) They end up dead. Good move guys. Maybe the most fun and pathetic event in the movie happens a bit later. Several years have passed since the tragic incident of the jet race and we are listening to a network executive who had done a live broadcast of the race. The executive says ... are you ready? ... he says the footage of the planes that collided during the race was the best rated news recording they had shown for the past four years. Amazing ! ! Talk about a future world in which nothing exciting happens. It must be boring. Other things to look for are people who somehow make a coughing sound while their mouth does not even move. In addition, a scene in which a shirtless Sabato Jr. is about to put on a tank top. He picks it up but the camera changes angle and now you can not see it anywhere. Then, the camera changes angle again and is passing it over the head. Great edition! Everything is a bargain basement in this movie, except for the half decent performance. However, with a fine plot like paper and terrible effects, I recommend that you do not waste your time watching this disaster. One final note ... without nudity and graphic violence, I have no idea why this is qualified as R.""",0

I can not believe that everyone was so tied up in cash, all of them are billed by the television actress Kristianna Loken (who last saw the big screen while playing the monster of the bad boss in Terminator 3), in the main role of The movie, a half human vampire half that is about to kill Kingsley The character of Kagan, because Kagan killed Rayne\'s mother The fact that he is also her father does not seem to make her question her motivation too much. This film has enough character to have a lot of motivation, that does not seem to bother Boll, who cuts this movie in exactly the same way as the others: a lot of action, touches of sex that could actually be interesting if you care enough to explore those scenes, a useless script, a camera work that is just this competent side, and Boll\'s rather impressive ability to squeeze the worst possible performance from anyone who throws. And yet, despite all this, the most depressing thing about Bloodrayne is that the movie went well enough abroad (predictably, it fell like a nightmare in the United States, earning two and a half million, well below a fifth of your budget) that Vivendi gave the green light to Bloodrayne II. At least none of the original cast, including Loken, was strong enough to sign up for what can not help but be another Boll monstrosity. (zero)'",0

"b'This is my favorite movie about Bernadette and Lourdes. And now this new remastered large screen version, just released by Ignatius, has a high quality image and higher quality, along with so many bonus additions, including the first available version of the French version (original) and the wonderful movie and Radio interviews with the wonderful Sydney Penny. Those interviews add a lot to this movie package. It\'s great to see and hear the lovely Sydney Penny speak in person about what it meant to play this role. (This film was actually filmed in English and French, with two shots followed by Jean Delannoy, and both versions are on this DVD.) ALSO: the glorious voice of the incredible singer Jenifer Warnes and that deeply moving song that she and Leonard Cohen wrote, ""Song of Bernadette"", on the extra CD in this package. Now I hope that many, many more people will listen to this beautiful song and tribute to Bernadette for this fabulous Grammy winning artist. She also has a second beauty sung by Jennifer Warnes on the CD, her song `` Prairie Melancholy \'\'. Another jewel of the music of this celestial singer. In this 150 year anniversary of the Lourdes apparitions, this new remastered film recently, with the audio CD and the songs, Penny\'s interviews and the 16-page Collector\'s Brochure, is a wonderful way to honor the story of Lourdes and this inspiring movie.'",1
"b'The cultural revolution that shook Paris from 1905 to 1930 is well documented in this fascinating two-hour DVD documentary, which includes photographs, film archives, literary excerpts and analysis. The focus on the arts, from classical music and jazz to sculpture, from poetry to dance, from canvases painted to novels. The rise of modernism from the post-impressionists to Fauvism, Cubism, Dadaism and Surrealism and its many works of art and literary pioneers is seen as an extraordinary period of free experimentation and interdisciplinary interactions, particularly between poets and artists. Paris was the fermentation pot and the vanguard was strong, sharp and multiple. Watching this documentary can cause envy. Or to have lived in that moment! Of course, I and many of my generation experienced such a revolution, albeit of shorter duration in this accelerating society, when the Bay Area of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bSan Francisco circa 1965 to 1980 was the center of scientific, musical, artistic, noetic, ecological and scientific innovations. of another type. and explorations. What brings up a small deficiency in the documentary: the absence of mention of developments in science, especially physics, and its influence on the arts, when the concepts of time and space and matter were subject to a radically new thinking . Otherwise, the survey is a wonderful cultural story, from the optimism of before the First World War and the engine of cynicism and creative criticism after that carnage. The viewer can immerse themselves in the many books that cover this exciting period for further study. This DVD is an excellent introduction in art history and cultural studies.'",1
"b""We should all congratulate Uwe Boll. It's like a kind of cinematic cockroach. No matter how little talent he has, and no matter how bad these films are, he manages to keep doing it. I know, he funds them all through some kind of strange German background, but even so, his ability to continue making films despite total and absolute failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe. It would not be so bad except that video game developers continue to give their best properties to this guy. I really enjoyed the Alone in the Dark series of games. Even the last one, the New Nightmare, was good for a few hours of play. There was a good movie to make of the adventures of Edward Carnby, but this is not all. Now Uwe Boll has in his hands Bloodrayne and Hunter: the Reckoning. What's next, Silent Hill? Doom? I can only imagine the range that this guy is going to cut through game-to-movie adaptations if he does not stop. Someone has to take away your line of credit, or these video game publishers must realize and realize that when they make a bad movie of a game that kills the franchise, no one is interested in that title anymore. Think about it. , is House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark a viable game title? No way . A new game of House of the Dead goes out for XBox and nobody cares about it. The title is dead, and all for Uwe Boll. So, if one of you works for a game editor, or knows a game editor, or has access to a game editor ... please let them know. This movie in itself does not even deserve to be reviewed. I can not separate what I did not like from this pile of manure from the rest. Literally, everything about that sucks. Writing, acting, music, CG effects, editing. I thought that if I waited until it came out on DVD and then I rented it with few expectations, I would not be disappointed. Even the $ 5 you will spend on this DVD if you buy it used at one of the Amazon sellers is too much. You will regret it . This movie is just a bunch of Boll.""",0
"b'There are many scenes in this movie that really tell the truth about how secretaries are treated in the American workplace. A scene that remains in my mind is when the character of Griffith tracks an executive who has received an important call. The executive gets angry at her for bothering him and asks why he did not give the information to the client. & quot; He does not want to hear from a secretary, & quot; she says .

"b'This musical still delights us and we love it ... more than 40 years after its creation. We win our old-fashioned applause, with good solid music and dance entertainment. Robert Preston shines like Professor Harold Hill ... an unscrupulous swindler who intends to cheat the entire population (around 2,400) of River City, Iowa. He works his way into their hearts (and their pockets) and manages to stay one step ahead of the authorities. Along the way, he (Prof. Hill) touches the lives of an old maid (Shirley Jones as Marian the librarian) and his extremely shy little brother Winthrop (played by a very young and adorable Ronnie Howard) and, to his surprise, It is in the unknown territory of a good doer. His planned escape stalled, he got caught and must, um, face the music. Throughout the way we are given quite a few memorable and fun songs and some delicious dance routines. The filmmakers showed some waste ... using some imagination and taking a risk ... and they gave us a lot of entertainment. My favorite places are the opening sequence of the train and the excellent dance scene (and song) inside the library. The people of River City are stubborn and narrow-minded ... but in reality they are producers of comedies. Virtually all the adult characters in the film deliver their share of the work load ... and add humor to the general fun of the film. Paul Ford, like the bewildered mayor George Shinn, is particularly good ... and Hermione Gingold, who plays his wife Eulalie, is also funny (though in a different way). Shirley Jones is pretty good here. She has always been a great singer, but she also makes some effective and fantasy steps. Pert Kelton, like his Irish mother, is a delight. But the program belongs practically to Robert Preston. A very skilled animator, he is light-footed and equally agile (and agile) as he handles his lines. He is not a great singer ... he speaks most of the lyrics of his songs ... but they (the songs) work, and they work well. I heard that, in the pre-production phase of making the film, they wanted to replace Robert Preston (the star of the theatrical version of ""The Music Man"") with another person. Meredith Willson, the writer of the original story, gave them an ultimatum ... either Robert Preston stays or ... there is no movie. And, seeing him act (Preston) here, it is easy to understand that feeling. He is a delight.'",1
"b""This shows that, until the end, the King of Pop possessed all the elements that made him a superstar. Here we see the preparation of his failed London Comeback, but although we all know how this story ends, you can not help but smile when you see Michael in his element of home and just have fun. The most intriguing part of this documentary is the lack of real dialogue of Michael Jackson, but you can feel totally in their expressions the gears that work busily in their interior; He was pouring every ounce of effort he could muster in this final effort to thrill the world. This is Michael Jackson, unlike what he has seen in years. Here he sings all his songs live, even the fastest ones like Jam, They Do not About About, and Smooth Criminal. This element also really shows the fans how really exhausting it was for him to give the crowds dancing and singing, and this footage makes it obvious why for Dangerous and History tours he had to synchronize several numbers faster. Many of MJ's dance moves are omitted, and I wish I could have seen some of the essay sequences without the occasional distraction. of the 3-D short films (I wish they had put it on a split screen so we could watch that footage and the acting on the stage at the same time). The highlighted performances of the essay are definitely the following: They do not care I can not stop loving you. I'll be there. Thriller (totally new production that the one that was used in the tours of Dangerous and History!). Beat It (for the first time in years I have seen it dance the same as in 1982!) The others are also good, but none are as crisp or polished as those trial numbers. The key point of this rehearsal recording is getting to hear him sing his hits live, and it would have been better if the album This Is It included those instead of the studio versions ... Also, Michael's new female guitarist is great (in the eyes and in the ears). Many dance moves of MJ are omitted, and I wish we could have seen some of the rehearsal material without the occasional distraction of the 3-D short films (I wish they had put it in a screen division so we can see that footage and the performance of the stage at the same time). Therefore, to be fair, it is not at all an MJ concert experience, but it does have all the elements of one. The slogan of `` Know the man you never met '' is not really accurate because there is very little of Michael Jackson's true dialogue outside of seeing him say `` God bless him '' to everyone on the production team and point out when he thinks that something must be changed about the way something is done. Everything and all this is probably going to be remembered as the best concert that ever happened in the history of music. From these few vague fragments of what is the concert of This Is It Real, we can see that Michael would have had a great comeback through this series of concerts, and that once again he has demonstrated that he was and always will be the King of Pop. It is recalled that although the tabloids tried to throw him into the light of evil, Michael Jackson's ONLY message was of love. LOVE . clear and simple""",1

"b'I found this movie completely entertaining. The story is simple and, in some way, quite important: Camille, a well-known Parisian actress, returns from Rome to perform in front of her local audience in a play directed by her new lover Ugo. The work is Come Tu Mi Vuoi by Pirandello, a classic (written for his lover Martha Abba) about a woman trapped between the yin and yang forces of reality and illusion. Throughout the film, Rivette switches his camera between the play and Camille and the ""reality"" of Ugo, as if to ask who the real Camille and Ugo are. What do they really want? What makes them work? Can I, the viewer, enter his universe without scriptures? Rivette (and his excellent actors) show us that delicacy can be robust and inventive, that the desire for another can never be fulfilled and that compliance does not really matter, because in the process of the struggle to achieve it we become alive and creative . . What matters is the style; style is substance We are also offered a brilliant description of the incestuous relationship between the Italians and the French, and there is a delicious succession of nuances, suggestions and games with national stereotypes that made me smile.

The video is a minor update to the clarity of the DVD, but not the Wow! factor we expect from 1080p blu ray. The problem could be that Warner / New Line used a single-layer disk (25 GB) and not the upper 50 GB disk. Why would they do it, when the only thing on this album is the movie and a theatrical trailer. I can not believe that Warner released this as they did. Do not pay the outrageous price that Amazon is asking for. I got mine for less than $ 14 at Best Buy. For this price it is worth the update. The soundtrack is still one of the best!

"b'I do not know what to say about this mess of a movie. First of all, I have not played the game, but I would probably win an academic prize before this movie did. What a loss of prestige for an excellent videogame. Yes, it started as if it was great, so people tried to act. What can I say, Michael Madsen ... It seems you never rehearsed and read the reference cards. He just does not fit into this role. He just seems to keep the role of gangster in any movie he gets, without ever adapting his affection.

"b'Toilet training is part of the parenting process and, although it usually begins in the young child\'s years, it can take more time with some children than with others. Potty Power tries to accelerate the process by presenting a DVD that encourages children to use the potty and leave their diapers or diapers forever. He achieves this through his talk, songs, sketches and optimistic attitude about the use of the potty. Jessica, the narrator of Potty Power, is encouraging and extremely cheerful. She talks about pee and poop, slang terms for bodily functions, and more, while managing to keep a smile on her face throughout. She really wants the children to learn to use the potty, and her enthusiasm, hopefully, will be passed on to the children watching the DVD. This DVD is certainly useful and I know many people who have had great success in showing them this training session. Small children. But it gets a little cheesy and many adults will roll their eyes while they listen to the dialogue and the songs. Songs like ""I\'m proud to wear my underwear, clean my ass"" and others are certainly attractive to young children, but even some young people will find the material too dumb to be true. One of my babies is already trained to go to the bathroom and she laughs out loud when she watches this DVD, due to her silly and often cheesy style. Leaving aside the important thing is the effectiveness of the DVD and, in my experience, Potty Power has made a difference. My youngest likes to repeat the lines he has heard from this DVD and he likes to sing along with the songs. She has been going alone, to the potty, so the DVD seems to have a positive effect, even if it sometimes becomes annoying. Potty Pot, despite its foolishness, is an effective means of weaning children. your diapers and pull-ups. If you manage to pass the foolishness of the whole experience, the excessive perplexity of the narrator and the parody at the end, Potty Power seems to have something in favor. Children will remember the melodies and the message, making this DVD a good complement to training for the bathroom.'",1

There\'s no doubt that this DVD was dominated by a vhs. How can I say ? When the audio tracks `` hi-fi \'\' of a vhs tape are wrong, it produces a very characteristic fluttering sound. This DVD is full of those kinds of mistakes. Then there is the overlap in the reel change where about 45 seconds of the show are repeated, followed immediately by a break and an ascending cut that omits about 95% of a scene. For a commercial release, this type of quality is totally unacceptable. There is a special place in the hereafter for the `` engineer \'\' who dominates this crap.

First of all, it is only in Standard that it is correct that the film has been cut from its original widescreen (which is how the laser disk was presented) to a format to suit its television mode. This is most noticeable when Mamora Fortuna's car passes by and half of the words are cut off from the image. Second, the digital transfer is horrible!

Leaving aside friendship, there is a lot of hard core detective work in this series. I enjoy the brainstorming sessions of Lynley and Havers and even their arguments, which can be scathing.

It can be directed by Uwe Boll, who is considered by many to be the worst director of all time, but if all of Boll\'s other films are like that, then Boll has been underestimated, because I\'ve seen many films that are much worse than this one ( for example, `` The Stepford Wives remake \'\'). The script is based on a video game, which gives `` video game \'\', moving from level to level, feel that you get with many movies of this type (like `` Resident Evil \'\' or `` Doom \'\'), but that did not discourage me so much as to want to go out and play the game. . Not being a player, this was my first encounter with `` Alone in the Dark \'\', and I found that the story was interesting enough to keep my interest in the length of the movie. The performance is unequal in quality. Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff (as another government agent) give decent shows, but Tara Reid is as unconvincing as she is a scientist who actually contributes to the entertainment value of the film. My main criticism is that some of the battle scenes are too long.

Here we have a movie of werewolves with adventures, black comedy, some meat [both pressed and torn like bloody pieces], laughter, ""oh-my-gods"" and even pathos. This is a great imaginative and inventive film with excellent special effects that you will never forget, since I have not seen it since I saw it in 81. It starts with a couple of young Americans who travel through the eerie European countryside at night. I love the scene where they enter a pub and are welcome like the plague. Both leave the place and are quickly attacked by a werewolf with a man who is killed and the other, the places where David Naughton [who plays David] survived only to become a murderous werewolf. All hell breaks loose later, while David falls in love during the day, kills at night and constantly runs into his backpack partner ""with his back to his death"", Jack, with torn and torn flesh. He shrugs with shame and laughs, because with each one of Jack\'s post-mortem appearances he is increasingly deteriorated until, in the end, he is nothing but a skull and a fascia. The scene in the theater when Jack presents David to each of his dead and devoured victims, complete with open holes and lost limbs, is a beauty. The scene of the transformation in which David becomes a werewolf in his living room is absolutely AMAZING and UNFORGETTABLE: this is a classic horror scene of all time. Greetings to the special effects and makeup professionals here. EXCELLENT filming by John Landis with refreshing originality and a wonderful and cunning variation of a stereotypical horror theme. I\'m sorry Naughton did not become the star he should have. If you have not seen this, DUE before the next full moon. Lon Chaney Jr would have been proud of these guys.'",1

"b""Michael J. Fox would not be Michael J. Fox without his starring role as Marty McFly in Back to the Future. This movie after 15 years still endures, since we can not wait to see the flying cars, or the time travel to when our parents were courting. This movie is a classic of all time. If you have not seen this movie, review it and part 2 and 3. A true trilogy, but each film is sustained. Great casting by Christopher Lloyd to play the senile and crazy Doc Brown who invents time travel. I memorized all the lines of this movie and told them to my friends all the time. & quot; Hi, McFly? & quot; & quot; What are you looking at in Butthead? & quot; & quot; Lorraine, I'm your density. I mean your destiny. & quot; Great movie, great cast (including BIFF) and a movie that I watch over and over and over again. I can not get enough.""",1
"b""We acquired this collection because we wanted to have the 1935 version of A Tale of Two Cities. We just saw it and had a wonderful experience. The film is very close to the plot, the performances are excellent. The book of Charles Dickens will forever be a testimony of the struggle of humanity between those who have and do not have. The performance of Blanche Yurka, as Madame DeFarge is outstanding. The citizens of France, seeking to put an end to the tyranny they experience from the oppressive aristocracy, present the endless example that when rights are trampled, it always ends in revolution and change. The Marquis St. Evremonde, played by Basil Rathbone, offers a glimpse of the horror it represents for anyone to show that they do not care about those who suffer. Especially when it comes to children; because the horror committed against this family, causes the fire that leads to events that put an end to the ruling society. Manette's performance as the innocent man who was imprisoned in the Bastille for more than 18 years is excellent. His daughter, played by Elizabeth Allen, represents the person who inspires great love in two men, one Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton, superbly played by Ronald Colman. The character of Miss Pross, played by Edna May Oliver, is incredible. We went from disliking her, admiring her and then loving her for her sacrifice that saves Mrs. Manette's life. In the end, the sacrifice made by Sydney for Lucie's love is one of the most sensitive and moving love stories. He finds a purpose for his life, knowing very well that his actions will live forever in the hearts of those for whom he sacrifices himself. I highly recommend having this DVD. The other films will be reviewed as we see them.""",1
"b'It has been said many times, but it is worth another 2 cents: a mediocre story and wonderful acting. The casting and acting are impeccable, and the chemistry between the two talented potential clients is wonderful, but even so I found it empty and depressing.

I received the version with the white background with the red drawing of the sun and the color of Bronson, Mifune, Andres and Stamp on the cover. In packaging, Evergreen Entertainment is indicated as the DVD producer; Amazon's description refers to Evergreen as the Studio. It looks quatlity from the outside and says it has been remastered and that the format is letterbox. Is not true . It's a poor transfer of a video and it's clipped, not even close to the mailbox and the sound is badly mastered. Even the menu spells the words wrong. Amazon has really confused the critics who try to protect other buyers of DVDs and CDs by combining the reviews of all the copies of films and CDs. Good luck analyzing the offers now. I will get a good impression and a mailbox of this movie if I can find one with confidence, but I can not until now.""",0
"b""This fun and funny crime trick has a great cast and a lot of flavor from the south of the border that makes it entertaining 88 minutes at the movies. William A. Seiter's Borderline is a witty little movie that has more in common with The Big Steal than the often-announced black film. It is a mixture of humor, crime and fun that grows in you more and more until its fast end. It looks so much the L.A.P.D. and the United States Treasury Customs wants to stop a drug smuggling network bringing narcotics across the border from Mexico. Claire Trevor is the green police enthusiast L. Madeline Haley, former O.S.S. Agent who works his way up in the task of going south in an attempt to get information about the obnoxious middleman Pete Ritche, hoping he will take them to Mr. Big. Perry Mason of TV, Raymond Burr, is the heavy one in the white suit, Ritche, and plays the role with the threat. Macedline stumbles over Ritchie but before he can find anything, Johnny Mackland, an unknown player who works for the end of the connection, kidnaps Ritchie's gold so he can reach an agreement for the next shipment. He ends up taking Madeline with him after the weapons are ready and the chase is under way. The persecution through Mexico, while trying to avoid Ritchie and elude the police is very funny. Madeline and Johnny begin to tell stories to each other and to warm up along the way. When Johnny, Johnny's friend, is shot, they have a body in their hands to face, which complicates the persecution even more. Fred MacMurray is good as Johnny, the policeman who does not know that Madeline is a policeman, who does not know he is a policeman! A kind of funny pulp movie with more flavor than a habanero, Trevor gives a nice performance as he begins to love Johnny, he even gets a little jealous of the friendly and young daughter of a Mexican policeman not too smart. Without knowing it, it helps them to get a plane to Encinada for the big problem. While the two approach the border, each regrets having to deliver to the other because they have fallen in love with each other. Once they get ready just for whom they work, a gun battle with Ritchie and his gang comes to a climax. ending this very funny movie. A film that is understood as entertainment, is not taken too seriously, and you should not do it either. Fans of genre films like this will enjoy going south of the border with it.""",1
"b""I saw the film and felt that I was missing pieces, that the scenes were shorter, even that entire scenes were missing, but it had been so long since I saw it, that I thought I remembered that the film was better than it really was. Then I looked at the director's comment. It took at least 15 minutes of the movie. Most directors add to their film when given a chance, they do not take it away. The Son of the Director created a disconnected and fragmentary film very different from the original in the mood and the plot. After waiting years for the DVD release of Erik the Viking, I was extremely disappointed and a little angry at the way they treated one of my favorite movies. I hope to see the theatrical release available sometime in the near future, as I do not think I'll see the director's Son's Cut again, and I certainly will not share this version of the book. movie with friends and family as I had originally planned.""",0
"b'If you have not read the book yet, you are missing a lot of crucial information to understand what happens in the movie. On the other hand, it has more action and exciting twists non-stop than the movie, and the movie tends to be confusing without reading. I have some objections to the movie; first, of course, some very important facts explained in the book are explained, second, the script of the film has some differences with the original Dan Brown novel: - At the beginning of the film, Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) signs his book at an event in Paris, while in the novel the book was still published In relation to this scene, the French police picked him up at this event to go to the Louvre, while in the novel it was already very late and he was sleeping in the hotel . The whole sequence of escape from the Louvre was much more exciting. The book, and was oversimplified in the film. - The suspected conspiracy between the Vatican and Opus Dei has some twists in the book, and it was a total change in the film. The relationship between the Vatican and the Opus Dei group is described in more detail. There is a lot of missing information about Silas, the albino monk. Getting the Swiss bank safe was much more interesting in the book. it was an additional Criptek in the book. - There are other crucial differences towards the middle and the end of the film, but I do not want to mention it, because if you have not read the book or you do not look like the movie, it will ruin the suspense for you. Finally, read the book, watch the movie, do not listen to the critics, ... IMPORTANT IS WHAT YOU BELIEVE. Use your common sense and reasoning skills.4 stars for the movie, 50 stars for the book.'",1
"b'This movie is very funny and much smarter than some people will give you credit. Great comedic performances by Alan Cumming and Parker Posey, who chewed enough stage to create a sound studio. And the Pussycats are really fun, hot girls: it\'s not Rachel Leigh Cook who steals the show as Josie, but Tara Reid, whose ruddy blonde recalls an era of ""Laugh-In"" Goldie Hawn. Many fantastic jokes (get the PG-13 version), totally \'\' sleeveless \'\' costumes, some catchy songs ... and yes, all those product placements.

"b""Having played the two games `` BloodRayne '', I am a fan of the series. Then, when I heard that they were making a movie, I was somewhat interested. But deep down, I knew it would probably stink. It was more than good. Unless you are interested in a ghost that is so terrible that it makes you laugh, DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE! It is a total disaster! Movie Rayne is nothing like his video game counterpart. The fight scenes were slow, nothing at all like the fluidity of the game. And do not make me start with spilled blood ... I've seen better settings in a haunted house. Nothing was done realistically, and the ten-minute summary at the end of the movie (which was done for some reason that I'll never understand) just shows how sloppy it is. The acting was not great either, and the brief sex scene ... let's say I found myself laughing at most of this mess. Unnecessarily, the plot was also missing (and that's very simple). If you want a vampire movie, pick up the `` Underworld '' movies. If you are a fan of `` BloodRayne '' looking for something to satisfy your fandom, play the game again. You will get more satisfaction than you would with this horrible interpretation.""",0

"b""I've said it before, and I'll say it again: the studios really should stop allowing small amateur production companies to publish their films on DVD. This Laurel & Hardy DVD is an excellent example of why. The most obvious and exasperating problem is that the soundtrack is not synchronized with the action; It's about 2 seconds behind. Unless you enjoy `` the boys '' looking like a dubbed Japanese movie, this will drive you crazy. The quality of the image is also really poor; I have a VHS copy of `` Flying Deuces '' that looks better than this. The question and answer game was a good idea, but poorly executed; `` What color is Stan Laurel's hair? '' How would I know? All your movies are in BLACK AND WHITE! Oy I thought I was getting a good double feature for a good price, but I ended up getting what I paid for: cheap movies. Save your money""",0
"b'The performance in this movie sucks, laughably. Even Tara Reid can not save this movie. What, Reid is a scientist because she puts on glasses? She looks more like a gymnastics trainer. Is Christian Slater smarter? The address is almost as bad as some Ed Wood movies. The film may have had a sci-fi storyline, but the movie hardly explored any part of its plot. The film is not only bad, it is sometimes boring, it is only stimulated by the fun of the scripts that are carried out horribly and by the action without sense. For the most part, this film incriminates its director. I give this movie two stars out of five. This movie at least had some images. I did not hate his stupidity as much as that other film also based on a video game, ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"", which I considered the worst movie of his year.'",0

"b'I had read all the reviews and thought that the bad ones were people who had not made enough effort, but believe me, I have tried with all my might. I still can not master the first dance, and I tried it for more than two weeks. When Tracy dances to the full rhythm, it seems that it does not coincide with the movements that she had broken down for you to learn. They are only small differences and I am sure that someone with a better dance experience or more coordination could be able to do them. I think that if one could master the movements, it would be great and, therefore, I am really disappointed that I could not deal with that.

"b'First of all ; I enjoy Troma movies. I\'m not ashamed of that either. I like science fiction. I even thought that watching `` The Postman \'\' was a decent way to spend a Thursday night. But this ... Battlefield Earth created the strangest atmosphere in my room. The usual comments never arrived. People just looked at each other with an empty, sad look in their eyes. It is not even funny. The only funny part is that John Travolta has tried to make this movie for a decade ... I do not understand why they had a list of actors cast in the credits. You see, they do not even tell you what the majority of the names of the characters are. Not until they die anyway. And in the end, when they come together and say `` Carlo did it! `` You do not even know who Carlo was or what the poor guy really did. As for credibility, well, I mean it\'s science fiction. It\'s okay . You do not look at Sci-Fi for that. But I still have to quote this line from the movie: Caveman in a military flight simulator: ""You\'re right! It\'s like riding a horse!"" It\'s good that it\'s that easy, because otherwise the scene Air-to-air combat in the ID4 style that would take place a week later would have been impossible ...

"b""This is the first time I'm reviewing anything on the web, but I felt I needed to comment on this movie. Obviously, the movie that Homer Simpson would say is the most sucking that sucks. Virtually everything that Uwe Boll, alias `` Toilet Boll '' directs, has been absorbed by hell. To be able to see a film by this director would be to be drunk or stoned or both. Even then it might not be enough. The good news is to use your movies as a torture device for terrorists. Someone suggested that the only thing Boll should direct is a porn movie. I am sorry I disagree . I'm sure you'll find some way to ruin that too. He would probably focus on the man's member instead of the woman's. No, the only thing that Boll should address should be the end of his career. The incredibly entertaining thing about this movie are the comments on this site and the critics on rottentomatoes. While I read them, I burst out laughing several times for a few minutes. The comment of an earlier critic about how the prostitutes in the film were real Romanian prostitutes is a riot. I'm not even going to delve into the plot, since it's inconsequential, so for all those who have not yet seen the movie, do yourself a favor and just read the reviews. It is much more entertaining and will definitely make you laugh out loud.""",0
"b""A Faustian turnaround through the postwar New York and Louisiana, 'Angel Heart' tells a very old story from a surprisingly original and wonderfully chilling angle. The plot, which focuses on the case of an increasingly violent disappeared person, is reasonably simple, but the background story that triggers it is remarkably complex. When you reassemble the pieces at the end, it makes sense, but it's only fair. De Niro is excellent as Louis Cyphre, the 'businessman' with some collateral to raise, infusing the role with the right balance of sardonic humor and demonic threat. Mickey Rourke gives what will probably always be his best performance as Harry Angel, a shocked and disheveled war veteran P.I. The supporting cast is excellent, especially Charlotte Rampling as an occultist, and Lisa Bonet as a teenage voodoo witch. But the real star here is the writer / director Alan Parker. He has an extraordinary talent for the simple but powerfully disturbing image: a slow zoom on the outside wall of a New York hotel; a New Year's Eve crowd in Times Square; a descending elevator; a sweeping staircase; the rotating blades of a fan. These images are simple, cold, but positively filled with an infernal threat. The music of Trevor Jones is the perfect accompaniment, his saxophones waving wildly over the threatening rhythms and the ubiquitous beat of a throbbing heart. It is a completely disturbing marriage that will be afraid of surrounding you with the same grim certainty as the protagonist's destiny.""",1

"b""I bought this Amazon DVD, although it may not seem like it, because I recently changed my email address and received another account. Anyway, I almost never write more than 3 or 4 line reviews, but this is one of those rare exceptions. I saw this movie for the second time a few days ago, and interestingly, the impact was even greater than the first time. Keep playing in my head all day. Some details that had escaped I noticed now. Despite what some people may say, I can not think of anything more beautiful and pure than the love the boy obviously felt for his soldier. When reading some reviews, I tend to agree with many of them. They say they were extremely sad. One woman said that she wanted to put the child and tell her that her prince would return. Another man said he was wondering if the soldier really knew how much the boy loved him. Rudy Van Dantzig died in January of this year and someone said that now he would finally meet his soldier. Touching They say that the book is not so romantic. Well, I could not read it, but judging by the movie, it's hard to imagine someone who would not like to live a romance as intense as that, although brief, and without taking into account. The reason for the unfortunate ending will always remain a mystery, and that, in my opinion, adds to the magic. I will not repeat here what has been said about the actors. They are really good. However, a special observation about the child and the soldier: they are really convincing and sometimes you even get the impression that they are really enjoying it. The boy has the kind of unusual and fleeting beauty you see once in your life. His eyes look sad, even when he smiles. Of course, there will always be those who are ready to criticize it, but that is to be expected. Let's face it: some things are not for everyone. Technically speaking, my only complaint is that, unfortunately, the quality of the image is not good, but the film itself makes up for it. And I will see it again! ! !""",1
"b""It is difficult to find words to begin to describe this fantastic show. First, the writing is excellent. There are elements of this story that make the viewer jump online or go to the local library to get more information about what is presented. There is a richness in the narrative that is not often seen on television today. For all that we are told, there are about twenty things that do not tell us ... what really involves the viewer in the program. It encourages active visualization, speculation, debate and research, among other things. That does not mean that one could not simply look at the show and get a supreme level of enjoyment from it. The first season, I was an almost active spectator, and I still thought it was the best show I had seen in my life. The image that creates the dialogue is incredible. And, of course, what is a great script without great talent to deliver the lines? In the forefront, there are powerful actors such as Clancy Brown as the troubled Brother Justin, and Nick Stahl as the quiet but intriguing Ben Hawkins. Seeing the seemingly disconnected stories between these two characters evolving is an incredible event. The show also features Tim DeKay, Clea Duvall, Cynthia Ettinger, Amy Madigan, Michael J. Anderson, Toby Huss, Brian Turk, Adrienne Barbeau, John Savage and even Pa Walton himself, Ralph Waite. If one is a fan of any of these actors, their talents stand out in this series. Emotions are high throughout the first season, and these actors know exactly how to portray them. And what is an excellent writing and a beautiful performance without a spectacular fall for the action to take place? From the windy sandstorms of Dustbowl Oklahoma to the beautiful countryside of rural California, each set is perfect. The eyes receive beautiful images to absorb. Finally, and most importantly, the great participation of history alone. As I mentioned earlier, this program makes one an active spectator. If ever, for a moment, you believed in the era of wonder ... the magic of the past ... this series is definitely worth the money. The elements of our daily life are put into question and a completely new world is created before their eyes. I challenge every person who buys the DVDs of the first season to watch only one episode at a time. Look at one and wait a week before seeing another. I bet you can not. You will be anxious to see what happens next. If you do not think this is possible with a television program, remember ... it's not television ... it's HBO.""",1
"b'I have to admit with shame that before this movie, I did not know who Harvey Pekar was. But that did not limit my ability to enjoy this movie, which was one of the most interesting I\'ve seen in a long time. The theme of the film as a whole is brilliantly summarized in the first few seconds of the film. Several guys go to a house on Halloween, all dressed up as Superheroes except for one guy, who is dressed just like him: Harvey Pekar. The film as a whole is about Pekar\'s attempt to tell his own worldly, boring and disappointing life in a comic. Instead of a comic about superheroes, he imagined a comic about himself, a file clerk at Veterans Hospital in Cleveland. The film tells the story of Pekar\'s life in varying degrees of detail, highlighting his encounter with R. Crumb in the 1960s and Crumb that inspired him to start a comic, despite his inability to draw. Taking incidents of his own life, involving his friends and colleagues, designing frames for comics, and then hiring artists to illustrate their stories (many by Crumb himself), Pekar manages to create something unique, fun and, in itself, strange, triumphant and beautiful. The film implies that we can all be the heroes of our own history. Not much happens in the movie, but it manages to be fascinating despite this. The big events in the narrative are the meeting of Pekar, R. Crumb, his decision to write his own comic, meet his wife, a series of special appearances in the late 1980s on the Dave Letterman Show and his fight against cancer. Throughout this, there is no attempt to make Pekar look better than him. He is described as physically unattractive, a bit odd, a chronic low performer, more than a little neurotic, and extremely self-absorbed. But despite all this, there is an honesty in looking at your life and practically representing it as it is, warts and everything. The way he handles everything with an indefatigable sense of humor and his determination to do something to give his life a focus and purpose is heroic in a very real and concrete way, as opposed to the false and fictional heroism of Superman, Batman, or Green Lantern. It would be difficult to surpass Paul Giamatti in the role of Harvey Pekar or Hope Davis playing Joyce Brabner, the woman who marries Pekar. Both the real Pekar and the real Brabner also appear in the camera, as do most of the real life models of the Pekar characters. In fact, the way in which the narrative of the film flows smoothly between real-life individuals, actors, comic book representations is one of the film\'s strengths. In one scene, Paul Giamatti playing Pekar and Judah Friedlander playing Pekar\'s friend (and minor MTV celebrity) Toby Radloff are on screen while the real Harvey Pekar and Toby Radloff have a conversation. Elsewhere in the film, Hope Davis and Paul Giamatti are supposedly behind the scenes on the Dave Letterman show, but when Giamatti as Pekar comes out to take the stage with Letterman, he cuts images of the real Pekar interviewed by Letterman. I remembered the famous Margritte painting, where he has a painting of a pipe with the words ""This is not a pipe"" underneath. Going from the real Pekar to an actor who plays it, is a way of saying ""This is not Harvey Pekar"" when Giamatti appears on the screen. In addition, he suggests that Giamatti is the cinematic equivalent of the various Pekars drawn in the comics. It\'s a great movie, and I hope it gets the attention it deserves. It\'s very different from the CRUMB movie, but I imagine it will especially appeal to those who enjoyed that strange but fascinating documentary.'",1
"b'I\'m not going to destroy Hilary Duff as a previous critic, because in fact I think she was the best part of this movie, hence the only star. It\'s fun and feminine, but I could not enjoy it because of the constant stereotypes (ie, the blonde girl enters the business world and knows nothing apart from how to use color, as well as the consistent way in which female characters judge to men for their ""hot abs"" or ""tight ass""). It just seems a bit sexist in terms of the male and female characters and, although I know that most girl movies are like that to a certain extent, it has never been so big as to feel the need to disconnect. The English boy\'s accent is laughable. Why do not they just use the English to portray the English instead of people whose accents flip between Australians and Americans? The other characters besides Lane are pretty trash and wood, including his best friend and pretty much all the people he works with. The story, I suppose, is cheery and cheesy, but if you have an ounce of intellect and do not assume that all women are empty-headed whose object is specialized in layers and the value of men is evaluated by the narrowness of their buns, I suggest look elsewhere. I was also a little concerned about the sexual references (that is, painting the bodies of others with chocolate and then ""burning it"" after a date, talking about climax, etc.). Surely that is too much for a younger audience?'",0
"b""I believe that Waitress's excellence is independent, but my desire to please was undoubtedly intensified by the post-production tragedy of the murder of the writer and director Adrienne Shelly. I think that the co-star Cheryl Hines says it best in the film: Shelly's tragic and senseless death forces you to see the film from another perspective. I was surprised that Keri Russell was not nominated for any award for best actress. I thought she was outstanding. She is in every scene. His acting takes the movie. Actually, it's a series of interactions between her and her husband Earl (an incredibly nasty Jeremy Sisto), she and the client / owner Old Joe (a dyspeptic Andy Griffith) and she and the doctor / suitor Dr. Pomatter. In particular, the relationship between Russell's Jenna and Nathan Fillion's Pomatter is very well played, both by the actors themselves and by Shelly's strong writing and direction. She will be missed.""",1
"b""Beverly Hills Cop did not need a presentation. It was one of the best action comedies of 1984. It helped accommodate Eddie Murphy to the mainstream and reigned supreme in 1984. Beverly Hills Cop II was pretty good. A little exaggerated but fun. It combined the filming style of Tony Scott and captured the essence of the 80s. This monstrosity is instantly forgettable from beginning to end. A bust goes horribly wrong and Inspector Todd (Gilbert R Hill) is killed. Axel (Eddie Murphy) traces the killer known as Ellis De Wald (Timothy Carhart) to a cheesy Disney impersonation called Wonderworld, where Ellis De Wald is the supervisor. Where do I start first? Axel Foley does not even feel like Axel Foley (something like Big Top Pee Wee is different from Pee Wee from Big Adventure). Eddie spends the whole movie looking like he can not grasp what his character is supposed to be. It was the stubborn but stupid policeman who bothered his target. He is replaced by a guy who is so relaxed in his behavior that he becomes bored of seeing him after a while. The only characters that return are Inspector Todd (but they kill him at first) and Rosewood (Judge Reinhold). Taggart is gone and so is the sergeant. Bogomil. That was the clue that this movie was DOA. The first two BHC movies had pretty good villains considering the time period. Victor Maitland and The Alphabet Killer were good villains, but Ellis De Wald is horrible. Without disrespect towards Timothy Carhart, but he was quite hammy and his mater plan was weak and showed laziness on behalf of the writers. Do you use an amusement park to make counterfeit cash? How strange it is. The film is rarely funny and bringing Serge back (Bronson Pinochet) was a cheap attempt to remember the first interaction between Serge and Axel Foley in the first film. There is a redeeming moment in this movie: the parking sequence in the malfunction where Axel saves two children. This scene is the only reason I gave him two stars. Humor is for the most part forced and if you ever listen to that annoying Wonderworld song it will be too soon. Who thought it was a fun plot device anyway? In conclusion, this movie killed a promising series. It's a shame that the same wonderful director (John Landis) behind Animal House, Blues Brothers, Coming To America and some other of my favorite movies is behind this mess. John Landis is a great director, but not a great director for this type of films. Thumbs down.""",0

"b'In movies, as in most other forms of art, the larger works often come in smaller packages. Such is the case of `` The Five Senses \'\', an independent Canadian production that chooses for its subject nothing less profound than a meditation on what it means to be human. Writer / director Jeremy Podeswa has created a work of great poetic form and vision centered on a group of people who share the universal need to find true love and acceptance in a world where wounded and shattered relationships too often result in loneliness and magnified despair. Like all of us, each of these characters gropes for the dual goals of intimacy with others and the acceptance of oneself that are essential to human happiness. Some are successful, while others fail, just like in life, but none of the characters remain unchanged from experience. `` The Five Senses \'\', although it has a plot, is more an emotional piece than a narrative drama. Blessed with an excellent ensemble cast, Podeswa is able to draw us to the center of his world through the use of sensory images and a deliberate and methodical rhythm. In fact, one of the strongest themes that the film goes through is its examination of the part that our senses play in the definition of our world and character. Podeswa understands that we have become insensitive to our senses. As a result, use this movie to reconnect with that crucial element of our being. The quiet and silent tone, the dull autumn colors, the slowly moving camera, the disturbing music combine to create an atmosphere in which the public can become aware of every vision and sound that is presented to us. In our effort to establish meaningful intimacy with other human beings, we generally trust the sense of touch; however, this can serve, Podeswa shows us, both to trap us in a false intimacy and to lead us to one that is genuine. and durable Several of their characters use sex as a substitute for true closeness, while others establish a physical connection at a much deeper level. One of the most moving moments of the film occurs when a gay man, most likely an AIDS patient, breaks down to mourn during a massage session, with a broken heart because nobody has dared to touch him in a long time. This film recognizes the vital part that tender physical contact plays in the totality of a person\'s humanity. In a similar way, the film explores the beauty of sound, since one of the characters, ironically, an oculist, a man dedicated to preserve the organ of a sense, faces the prospect of imminent deafness and longs to create a mental catalog of all the exquisite sounds of everyday life that you will soon no longer be able to hear and that we so routinely take for granted. However, like all other characters, it is their spiritual emptiness and their inability to establish a meaningful connection with another human being that bring them their greatest obstacles to happiness. Podeswa also examines the smell that the part has when making that vital human connection, since one of the characters, a lonely gay man, revisits his former lovers to inhale his scent in an effort to discover if he can smell ""true love."" "" `` However, `` The Five Senses \'\' is not simply a movie based on an ingenious \'\' trick \'\'. ""On the contrary, breathes with the fullness of humanity because each of its many characters emerges as a fully developed and instantly recognizable human being."" There are adolescents alienated by their own inability to fit into the accepted norm of society and made to feel guilty There are mothers who are terrified of losing their children, in one case, literally, when their daughter goes away and disappears and, in another case, in a figurative sense, since her teenage daughter seems to slip into inexplicable ""strangeness"". ""There are adults who can not understand a life full of failed relationships that despairs for that last chance of happiness, often with the result that they end up farther than ever from that universally desired goal. One of the most daring aspects of `` The Five Senses \'\' is that it does not succumb to the temptation to provide a `` happy \'\' ending or even a conclusive ending for all its characters. The film recognizes that life is a messy and endless process of changing fortunes and personal growth and remains faithful to that theme until the end. This brave, disturbing and hypnotic film definitely stands as one of the real movie finds of recent years - a true work of art!'",1

"b'`` The Exorcist \'\', along with films like `` Rosemary\'s Baby \'\', `` The Shining \'\' and `` The Ring \'\' stand out to me as some of the best horror films of all time. Not only were they good movies in themselves, but they `` broke the rules \'\' and stepped on new ground. This DVD contains many deleted scenes and behind the scenes you can see the making of the film. I know I\'ve heard that after a screening of the film a few months before its release, some screen executives thought that the movie should not be released. It was too scary. When you really look at the movie for the first time, you will be really scared ... ... if you assimilate it enough. Some people remember him for the ""pea soup"" incident, but this movie did not use gore to show his point. Like the other films listed above, he used intelligent images, dialogues and symbols to express his points. Most people who read this review know that the story was based on a case in 1947 in which a 13-year-old boy was supposed to be possessed. . Obviously, some details of the movie were changed. I would like to see a film of the ""true"" story of 1947 made in which no name is revealed, but the facts of the case are given. The Exorcist really deserves the 5 stars. Perhaps more writers and filmmakers today should go back and look at it before trying to make another stupid teen movie that calls itself a horror movie.'",1
"b'You\'d better like the ham if you plan to pass this movie. The old millionaire Nutty John Carradine dies and puts a stipulation on the fulfillment of his estate on his four children and three servants through a tape recorded in which he expresses nothing but dislike for all and says strange things like `` this could to separate the rabbits from the stray cats \'\' and then he laughs maniacally. They have to spend a week at home or they can not get their share of the inheritance. Every person in the movie is totally obnoxious, and halfway I did not care how the movie ended, as long as it was over. After the children are installed in the house, everyone begins to die in a variety of strange ways that present themselves in an unconvincing manner: Johnny is killed in a convenient piranha tank, the head of another is under aluminum foil On a plate in the refrigerator, a couple is killed by electrocution in bed, one is shot in the head, etc. . There are additional features like Carradine making an adult costume like an organ grinder monkey, free ax action on the head (one of the worst special effects), voracious insects, whipping, a servant named Igor, and overacting the likes of which weird they see each other The film moves forward, and it is obvious how the conclusion will unfold in the middle of the film. A special mention goes to the last line of the film directed directly to the audience ""And I bet you thought it was the butler all the time."" Also the value of the extreme annoyance is the closing music, which borders on the impossible to hear . I gave this movie two stars (generously) for the minor, but hilariously hammy performance by John Carradine. Truly a horror master in his time, but an even greater teacher of overacting when his day had passed.'",0
"b""I enjoyed the special features as well as the episodes. Some of the guest stars that appeared in Bonanza gave comments about the episode in which they were. It was interesting how they explained where the episode was filmed and how the special effects did it. Everyone said that the Bonanza stars were a pleasure to work with and that everyone on the set was kind. David Dortort, the creator of Bonanza also gave interesting interviews. I especially liked his interview called `` Remembering Pernell Roberts ''. The photo gallery contains photos of the stars in their homes. The episodes are not cut with scenes never before seen on TV. I recommend this DVD to any Bonanza fan.""",1
"b""This movie is often forgotten when you make a full account of great American movies of any age. Artur Penn made a superb sociological portrait of the persecution and revenge desires of the crowd with interesting ideas and serious connotations. This movie threw the ring to Robert Redford and gave Brando another chance to play an unusual and magnificent role. And despite the many problems between Penn and the lighting supervisor according to Penn, he said in an interview with James Lipton in Inside the Actor's Studio, the film deserves a special place in the short list of gold of the great artistic triumphs of the United States. .""",1
"b'The Enterprise collects several envoys from several planets to deposit them in a planetoid called Babel. His plans are to discuss the acceptance of Coridan as a member of the Federation. Some members of the Federation are strongly opposed to accepting them. Reasons range from bloody enmities to criminals\' desire to steal valuable Dylithium crystals from the planet. The protection of the Federation would put an end to such criminal adventures of other members of the Federation. Among the delegates there are Vulcans, Andorians and an alien delegation with pig faces. They look like crosses between Bassett Hounds and the Ugnaughts of `` Return of the Jedi \'\' with eerily empty eyes and a bad temper. The makeup of the Andorians was remarkably well done during the period of time. When the ambassador of Vulcan Sarek and his wife Amanda board the Enterprise, there is an obvious tension and Sarek asks that someone other than Spock be his ""tour guide"" on the ship. It is then revealed that Sarek and Amanda are Spock\'s parents. Jane Wyatt is the wife and the loving mother who has subjected many of her emotions to accommodate Sarek, but still lets them sprout from time to time. Mark Lenard begins his life-long career as Sarek, whom we continue to watch until his death in one of the last seasons of `` Star Trek: The Next Generation. `` Sarek has not spoken to Spock in 4 years. Angry that his son refused to study the same subjects that he and his father had studied, there are angry silences, but muted between them. Amanda must run from one place to another to placate the two in her gentle way. One of the pig-faced aliens, a tough guy named Gaz, confronts Sarek in the room and threatens him when Sarek declares his intention to vote for the acceptance of the Coridans. Shortly after, Gaz is found, murdered. An autopsy reveals that his neck was broken at a point that would cause instant death. Spock recognizes this as a form of death penalty used in Vulcan centuries before, preferred for its speed and painless delivery. A method called Tal-Shaya, well known to his father. An interesting fact is that the Romulan equivalent of the KGB is called Tal-Shayar in the Next Gen episodes: the Romulans are distant cousins \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bof the Vulcans and their languages \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bundoubtedly have common roots ... perhaps the English translation of Tal- Shayar be `` the neck killers \'\'? Anyway, it is believed that Sarek is suspect, but is removed when it is obvious that a defective heart valve has kept him out of service. A risky operation requires Spock, the only Vulcan on board with the same rare type of T-negative blood, to provide almost half of its blood during a transfusion. I do not know why they could not take a pint a day. Spock prepares to be the source of blood for his father when Kirk is attacked by an Andorian. The Andorian clearly stabs Kirk in the lower back, near his kidneys in the attack just before Kirk returns him and knocks him unconscious. Kirk leans to one side and raises a bloody hand and uses the wall-mounted intercom to call for help just before he loses consciousness. In the infirmary, we see Kirk with a bandage around his bare chest. Now they tell us that his lung was perforated and the Andorian barely missed his heart. Considering he was using a small knife that could not have come from his ass to his heart, I think they should have re-shot the scene of the fight, but that\'s the way I am. It is as if the lung injury was a reflection on the battle scene and perhaps the writers thought that the audience would not ""suffer"" a kidney injury in the same way that they would understand how a lung injury would take their breath away. Eh, whatever. Bad continuity in those scenes, in any way. Spock suddenly refuses to help in his father\'s surgery. Instead, he must command the Enterprise because there has been a murder aboard the Enterprise, an assassination attempt, discussions among the delegates and there an unidentified alien ship has been chasing them, just out of reach of their sensors and weapons. Like a pain, disoriented Kirk wakes up in Sick Bay, tells him the news and must find a way to get Spock to the operating table without violating Federation regulations and Vulcan\'s stubborn oath to duty and logic. A subsequent interrogation and the search for the Andorian who attacked Kirk results in some interesting finds that will make it on the edge of his seat.Despite some cheese here and there, this is one of the most exciting episodes of the ancient series. An excellent show'",1
"b'Stephen King is best known for his books of the macabre, but what some people do not know is that he is also a master of comedy, as is the case of `` The Langoliers \'\'. The book was very complex and hilarious study of the human mind. The film goes even deeper, showing how funny people can be when faced with eminent destruction. Both the film and the book ask the question: ""What would you do if you fell asleep on a plane, but everyone who was awake died? , and that one of the people on your plane is a psychopath, and another is a blind child who can feel bad, something like Haley Joel Osment in `` The Sixth Sense \'\', then you seek refuge in an airport, but all the carbonated drinks are flat and the food spoils, then you discover that these Pac-Man creatures (`` the Langoliers \'\') literally consume the past? `` Well, what would you do? It is a difficult question, and to be honest, I do not know what I would do. But I can say one thing, Bronson Pinchot (in a performance that is quite different from his beloved character Balki Bartokomous on the popular television show ""Perfect Strangers"") does not know how to answer the question either. Man, he goes crazy, and I\'m not talking about Riggs in ""Lethal Weapon"", ""crazy"", I mean he really goes crazy. It can be said that Pinchot really adopted this role for what it was and took the method of acting at a completely new level. Still not convinced? After all the laughs and slapstick routines (the scene in which Dean Stockwell drinks beer at the airport is absolutely great!), You are offered a fantastic suspense scene in which the Langoliers chase the fast plane by the fugitive . Just when the plane is preparing to take off the sharp teeth of Langoliers ... I\'m sorry, but you\'re going to have to watch the movie to find out how it ends.

"b""This biopic, based on Take Me Home, An Autobiography by John Denver, will be enjoyed by hardcore fans (like me) but it is still horrible in many ways. The story begins in the early 60's when John (Chad Lowe) begins his career as a folk singer. Meet Annie (Kristin Davis) at a concert and fall in love on the spot. They get married and move to Aspen, but as John's career takes off, tension builds up in the marriage. They divorce, have a brief second marriage, and discover their love of flying, something that finally wins the respect of their stern father (Gerald McRaney). This movie is a summary of Cliffs Notes of John's life; It is badly written and amateur and lacks depth or emotion. Lowe (who puts on a disgusting clown wig that makes her look like Dana Carvey in `` Waynes World '') attacks without shame on all sides, playing an innocent lascivious who never seems to grow up. (In fact, although the film covers thirty years, nobody ages). Davis is very pretty, but the horrible script does not give her many opportunities to develop. McRaney plays the only character that seems real, and he is the villain of the piece. The story is superficial and Lowe's Denver is not particularly nice. His hair is so laughable and annoying that the movie has no chance. Although we hear Denver sing many of his songs, Lowe is terrible at lip syncing.

"b'Wish You Were Here was the follow-up album of Pink Floyds\' fucking commercial album, Dark Side Of The Moon that, among other great songs, contained perhaps its characteristic song, `` Money \'\'. Launched in September of 1975, Wish You Were Here is the favorite album of many of the members of the band and fanatics. When it hit the streets, it went directly to number one on the album charts in both the United Kingdom and the United States in 1975. From the first four notes, the basis of the song, invokes sadness, which was the story of Syd Barrett . Recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London during numerous sessions. Although some of these sessions were problematic, it was Roger Waters\' idea to split the central song ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"" in half and join each half with three new compositions. `` Shine On \'\' was a tribute to Barrett, who, coincidentally, made an impromptu visit to the studio while it was being recorded. Wish You Were Here is the second conceptual album of Pink Floyd written in its entirety by Waters. It reflects his feeling that the friendship that united the band was, at that time, largely absent. Deep on issues of absence, the greed of the music business and Barrett. The album begins with a long instrumental preamble and continues with the lyrics of ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"", a tribute to Syd Barrett, whose mental crisis forced him to leave the band several years before. Barrett is fondly remembered with phrases like ""Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun"" and ""You took the secret too early, you cried for the moon"". This simultaneous release on Blu-Ray and DVD is the authorized history of the album and was made with the full participation of the members of the band. The film is full of new interviews with Roger Waters, David Gilmour and Nick Mason and archival interviews with Richard Wright. Also included is manga designer Storm Thorgerson, guest vocalist Roy Harper and front man Ronnie Rondell and other staff involved in the making of the album. The members of the band discuss the initial difficulties of the first recording sessions and how the decision to divide `` Shine On \'\' became the catalyst. Other interesting information revealed through the interviews is the fact that before Barrett left the band, he had given up or abandoned the music `` beaten \'\'. he did not want to make music for ""Top Of The Pops"" and, ironically, band members blame the greed of the music business on themselves as the main impetuous for wanting to make music more commercially acceptable, if not exactly songs ""pop"". The film is also full of extracts from concerts and performances, as well as fragments of the band that work the parts. Pink Floyd: The story of Wish You Were Here is a fascinating documentary and worthy tribute to the band in the creation of the album of the masterpiece. For casual fans and collectors and musicologists, this is one you\'ll want to add to your collection. If you are an aspiring musician, then you will play again and again just to take a look at the creative concept. Syd Barrett was active in music for only about seven years, recording four singles, Pink Floyd\'s debut album The Piper in The Gates of Dawn (and contributed to the second), as well as several unreleased songs with Pink Floyd. In 1969, Barrett released a single, ""Octopus"", which presaged his first solo album (of two), The Madcap Laughs (1970), which was recorded over the course of a year (1968-1969) with 4 different producers as David Gilmour and Roger Waters. Almost two months after Madcaps was released, Barrett began working on his second album, Barrett, produced by Gilmour and Richard Wright, to be released in the late 1970s, before entering a self-imposed imprisonment that lasted more than thirty years. Barrett\'s innovative guitar work and the exploration of experimental techniques such as the use of dissonance, distortion and feedback had an enormous legacy not only in establishing the direction Floyd would take without him, but also musicians from David Bowie to Brian Eno and Jimmy Page and more influence of the drawing. After suffering from diabetes for several years, Barrett died at his home in Cambridge on July 7, 2006. He was 60 years old. The cause of death was pancreatic cancer. The occupation on his death certificate was given as `` retired musician. `` According to local newspapers, Barrett left approximately 1.7 million to his two brothers and two sisters. This sum apparently was largely acquired from royalties from Pink Floyd compilations and live recordings with songs he had written while he was with the band. The Dirty Lowdown'",1
"b""You can tell the editors of this movie that they want to get out of this fucking movie as quickly as possible.

"b""It seemed that this movie was aimed at that age group (13-16 years old) or the director / filmmaker was so old when they made this garbage. The director's comments changed my point of view about the first movie, so I thought that the director's comments would change my opinion about it. No, there is not so much luck. The performance was so bad that it made me laugh out loud. The complete madness of the `` general '' who mocked himself and said such stupid and silly things made me say `` wow '' aloud several times. The premise of the first film was to conclude that in the war all governments eventually become fascist governments. When I say `` turn into '' I do not mean that literally. Only that they behave and produce those results. This came directly from the director's mouth during his comment and that is what he was trying to convey. Upon hearing this comment (there are two, one from the director and the other from the director / cast) I did not really get a clear idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bwhat they were trying to say. Of course, there was an end in which the director said that the state will use religion for their benefit. If it interferes with them, they will try to eliminate it, if they believe they can use it as an advantage, they will do it. Regardless of these `` messages '' that they were trying to convey, it was done amateurishly and carelessly. I give science fiction a BIG margin for maneuver when it comes to suspending beliefs, however, I do have limits. There was something that occurred to me and could happen to you too. The way these people behaved made me believe that a very advanced technological society could be extremely careless and inefficient. Anyone who has been in our own army (as I did) would have thought of a million better ways to protect the base and fight against these insects. Even with our modern-day weapons, our own army could smother a volume of fire that would annihilate these insects. For a society that has been at war with these insects for the past 10 years, any government would dismiss the contractor or advanced weapons division that continues to use those ineffective firearms they use, despite the Marauders. The level of insubordination in these troops is surprising given the extreme threat and in some cases carries out punishments. But I guess that's part of the point; that a totalitarian society could produce armies with methods and leadership that are highly dysfunctional. These are some of the things that come to mind, although you can get it from the first movie without wasting your time on this bad one. I thought SST 2 was bad and I still think that one is worse than this, but not by much.""",0

The problem with the movie was the end. It was too abrupt and so confusing that one wonders if it is not complete.

It shows how a player was gradually caught in something he never planned. His motives might even have been considered somewhat admirable since he had in mind the interest of his girlfriend and little brother in deciding, reluctantly, to get involved. The subtle nature of temptation is transmitted because you are not asked to lose any game, just play badly enough to be close. Marshall Thompson plays the lead role of Johnny Long. Sports journalist Pete Ferreday is played by John Ireland. The script is written in such a way that the nuances of the characters appear. Felix Feist made a good noir-ish movie. Everything comes together in a way to keep your attention until the end.'",1
"b'Lacombe by Louis Malle, Lucien still impresses, although he tends to wander in the third act just when he is expected to squeeze more. But it remains a casually powerful reminder of the less heroic side of France under the Vichy government (the Nazis are barely seen in the film) since their not too bright farboyy simply moves almost accidentally in collaboration with the German Police completely composed of their compatriots after being rejected by the resistance. The film\'s greatest achievement is to show, like fascism in general, the appeal that collaboration had for the distrustful and marginalized in the community (only one of the ""police"" is a true fan) and the attraction of the unearned and unearned power as Lucien finds the power he has over people (particularly the tacit threat of surrendering his Jewish ""bride"" - perhaps somewhat symbolically called ""France"" - to the Germans) is much more intoxicating than killing animals . Throughout, as with the masterpiece of Melville\'s resistance, L\'Armee des Ombres, there is a mundane sense of reality that enhances the drama. Located in the kind of quaint little town that foreigners find idyllic, but which is a tedious hell to live for the locals, it shows how discomfort and opportunity is much more a driving force than malice. Certainly, it is far from glamorous, its collaborators roam in a local hotel getting drunk and lamenting their luck as war news gets worse (as noted, you have to listen to both German and British radio reports `` and divide the difference \'\' to discover the truth) and little by little the locals go crazy. The only extra on the Criterion album is the imaginative theatrical trailer, so it\'s worth picking up on the Criterion set that also includes Au Revoir Les Enfants, Murmur of the Heart and an exclusive extras album focused mainly on Louis Malle in place of the films themselves.'",1

Basically, the film becomes a long joke about a ""child"" in the adult world, but also tends to other problems: the loss of innocence and superficial honesty that prevails in childhood and then disappears in adulthood. Hanks, of course, is a hit in the toy company (how old would he be 13 years old?). But he falls in love with a co-worker, which makes the decision to go back to 13 at the end more heartbreaking.

Being an artist, you really do not know what will happen to our protagonist, Hitman at the end. I throw the original word in this paper for a couple of reasons. The main character, `` John Anderson \'\' played by Duvall (although as the same character we\'ve seen him play before) is a hit man with a difference, not too macho is used to create this vulnerable, aging and somewhat repentant professional. He does not regret the ""works"" he did, but as he approaches the twilight of his life he has not established real roots. However, now she has a girlfriend with a ten-year-old daughter, and her love and devotion for this child shines, as does Duvall\'s love for Tango, interpreted so beautifully many times by the captivating camera of very attractive Argentines. Both young and old. The plot of the murder is behind the Tango for a good part of the film, and when Duvall returns us to his purpose of being in Argentina, we feel as much as he does for having to leave this wonderful dance. There are one or two moments in which the scenes of Duvall could have been stricter, but I never felt that they were big negatives. In general, I would recommend this film to lovers of independent film, dance and fans of Robert Duvall.'",1

His portrait as the great artist is unimaginable and shows a tender side. In addition, Rex Harrison as Pope Julius II is also extraordinary. The two men create a good chemistry of the rebellious artist and a severe but sensible pontiff who entrusts Buonarroti with the great task of the Sistine.

The inconstant public certainly aroused their interest when, not long after the emission without surveillance, a simple maneuver to clean the house (removing the oxygen tanks) exposed a fatal flaw that led to a tremendous explosion. That explosion sent Apollo 13 flying out of control, ended with any hope of landing on the Moon, and the fate of the three astronauts (Major Jim Lovell, LM pilot Fred Haise and Command Module pilot Jack Swigert) is in doubt. The heroic efforts made by the members of the Control of the Mission, as well as by the astronauts themselves, to bring the Apollo 13 safely to Earth is one of the best stories that have been told. The acclaimed director, Ron Howard, saw this and, inspired by Lovell \'The personal story of that mission created one of the truly great historical films that once came to the screen. `` Apollo 13 \'\' is a true cinematic achievement. Restarts the imagination and marvels that the space program was held in the 1960s and early 1970s. Using cutting-edge special effects in the service of history (instead of in place of it), Howard can give it to the public a close view of the entire Apollo mission. Using archival images to create the special effects scenes, the director can make the shot look realistic, as if the viewer were standing at the top of the tower watching the rocket about to take off. The scenes in space are well elaborated and are extraordinarily realistic. When the astronauts are forced to close most of the lunar module, and the entire command module, to conserve power, the audience feels the coldness and resentment that these men had to endure. The true mark of the greatness of this film lies in the fact that, although we know from the story that the men of Apollo 13 survived, the final moments during the reentry, as shown in the film, are incredibly exciting and time consuming. Then, the emotional release that comes with knowing they did it is so overwhelming that even the most cynical and hard-hearted viewer will be choked with emotion. The narration and the effects of `` Apollo 13 \'\' are great, but the film would probably have still falls short if it were not for the tremendous cast hired to perform these roles. Tom Hanks is solid, since the imperturbable Jim Lovell, Bill Paxton (who seems to find a way to get into every blockbuster) is good as Fred Haise, the reliable but untested rookie, and Kevin Bacon offers an accurate description of the ultimate replacement. minute Jack Swigert. Gary Sinise plays Ken Mattingly, the astronaut Swigert replaced by fear of a measles infection, with the right melancholy. Ed Harris, who plays the mindless rock of a flight director, Gene Kranz, delivers the other truly outstanding performance. Harris really deserved his Oscar nomination for this performance and no doubt there is a strong argument for him to have won the award for the eventual winner of the supporting actor, Kevin Spacey. `` Apollo 13 \'\', in itself, was a strong contender for the Best Movie honors, only losing to the worthy `` Braveheart \'\'. The only disconcerting question is why Ron Howard was omitted from the Best Director nominations (he would have to wait 7 more years before receiving his deserved by ""A Beautiful Mind""). `` Apollo 13 \'\' is not just a great thriller; It is also a revealing history lesson. It allows us to remember those wonderful days of the search to reach the Moon, as well as the drama of that endangered flight. These days, it\'s disheartening to realize how the space program has stalled since those intoxicating days. `` Apollo 13 \'\' demonstrates, without a doubt, that we still have men with the will, the knowledge and the courage to take this space exploration to places beyond the imagination.'",1
"b""Zatoichi Vol. Four is as good as the first three volumes. Like some of the other episodes, they tend to be similar to some of the movies. Despite this, the series is excellent. You forget that you are watching a television program and you are immersed in the continuous story of ichi. I'm so happy that they finally come out on DVD, little by little, but being the big Ichi fan that I am, I could not get enough with all 25 of the 26 movies available. Where is # 14? ? ? ? My only complaint is that the media blasters would launch the series by seasons and not volumes. The 4th vol. It's still season 1.

"b""In Barbra Walter's interview with Al Pacino, several years ago, she said that this was Pacino's favorite role. But this film stands on its own despite this proclamation. This is the story of rags to the richness of the underworld with one of the biggest endings of a movie! Pacino plays a Cuban refugee thug, Tony Montana, who spider and drag (taking some lives along the way) to the top of the cocaine world in Miami with the help of his right hand Manny Ray (Steven Bauer). Pacino plays this part with such passion and energy that absolutely fuels this film from beginning to end. You can not take your eyes off the man. He adds humanistic dimensions to Tony Montana. It shows the humor, the machismo, the intelligence, the leadership, the guts and the shortcomings of Montana. It even shows the sensitive side of Montana (the scene with Michelle Pfeiffer next to the pool). Pacino really makes you like a character that is basically a safety ball. Now that's acting! There are memorable moments throughout this movie and some are very graphic, but what is probably the highlight of this movie is the great shoot 'em up scene at the end; Sosa's hit men infiltrated the Montana property to kill him because Montana made a big blow for Sosa. When Montana, full of cocaine, finally turns his attention back to the hit men, he fights again by challenging them with a machine gun / grenade launcher. & quot; Say hello to my little friend ! & quot; Now it's one of those famous movie lines in the history of cinema. He destroys them like dominoes, resisting the incredible shots caused by the cocaine in his system. This is a true & quot; boy is & quot; scene. It is an action driven by high octane adrenaline and Pacino plays it incredibly. His performance is so elastic that he wants to grab a machine gun and fight with him. Pacino ES Scarface! The DVD comes with great advantages such as theatrical trailers, production notes, biographies of actors and filmmakers, the realization of SCARFACE (with Pacino) and 10 shots of the film. The movie is in a mailbox format, but it is not digitally enhanced. It would have been nice to see the movie improved, but it does not affect the experience of watching this movie. In fact, I really do not care. It's SCARFACE!""",1
"b""When Bruce Lee died in 1973, 2 films were combined in an attempt to capitalize on Bruce Lee's madness by splicing some of Lee's best moments from the Green Hornet series, and doing 2 90 min. `` Bruce Lee films '' to the joy of those who were eager to get more footage of Bruce Lee. The first was titled `` Green Hornet '', the second was titled, curiously, `` Fury of the Dragon. `` What we have here is the official continuation of the first 90-minute Green Hornet show. An identical approach in that the production is composed of several scenes from the television series Green Hornet ... and the result? Despite some good moments and good memories of seeing Bruce Lee as a superhero and listening to his REAL voice, we are left with 90 minutes of uncomfortable mixes of stories that do not mix. I even remember seeing some fight scenes from the first movie. If you ask me, what we have here is a shadow of what would come in 1978 ... 20th Century Fox is killing Bruce Lee's Game of Death. The only difference was that they spliced \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bthe footage only instead of throwing a double unconvincing with 10 minutes of actual footage. Either way, this is a guardian for Bruce Lee fans, one that will be worth it in the near future.

"b'In my short list of must-see movie titles for 2011, Jose Padilha ""Elite Squad: The Enemy Within"" was certainly at the top of the list. I first learned about Padilha with the 2002 documentary `` Bus 174 \'\', an unforgettable real-life story of a bus hijacking that was publicly played in the Brazilian media. It was a heartbreaking image that had as much to say about contemporary journalism, rampant crime, local corruption, political maneuvering and the state of the police as it did about the actual event he portrayed. I think it\'s fair to say that some of these same themes have remained constant in all the future film efforts of the writer / director. That said, I want to point out that `` Elite Squad: The Enemy Within \'\' is actually a continuation of the 2007 project titled (you guessed it) `` Elite Squad. ""Although the two films are certainly better served as companion pieces, it has an independent story that can be enjoyed on its own merits."" If you choose to see this without having seen the first image, you may miss part of the background story The film focuses on the character that returns from Captain Nascimento, actually played by Wagner Moura, Moura is in charge of a special unit of crime and when a prison riot fails, the squad\'s tactics and decisions are questioned by human rights activists (dramatically guided by his ex-wife\'s new husband). Public opinion, however, is allied with the Moura for quick and uncompromising action and pushes it to a position of even more power, making it a mission to eliminate the rampant drug crisis in Rio, points to the lower class slums where the roblema has its strongest point. But by eliminating the obvious enemy, it can give way to a more unexpected nemesis. While corrupt policemen and unscrupulous politicians fight for a new power, Moura begins to realize that she has cut off the head of a monster to see another (more infamous) take her place. Unable to trust those in power, he sees new allies in the media and activists who were once critical of Moura\'s methods. The change is convincing, credible and undeniably terrifying. The film is shot in an aggressive documentary style that makes the unpleasantness even more tangible. While perhaps the narration depends too much on voice-over analysis, it does keep Moura\'s perspective in perspective, since the big story leaves it out of much of the action. In essence, it is a work of morality disguised as a saga of ruthless crimes, but in that sense it is surprisingly underestimated. The character changes are subtle and the action is relentlessly real. It is difficult to imagine that the film can have a happy or satisfactory conclusion, but what we have left certainly seems appropriate, even if it does not end all in a small bow. In the end, the characters distinguish this piece (Moura is fantastic) that has universal relevance in its corruption issues and those that would fight it. `` Elite Squad: The Enemy Within \'\' is a rare image that will make you think while entertaining. Around 4 1/2 stars. KGHarris, 2/12.'",1

These sheep end with a hunger for human flesh, and those that bite become monstrous sheep (yes, they were sheep), and before you know it, they are going crazy. Yes, Black Sheep sounds absolutely ridiculous, and of course it is, but the movie is so nice that you can not help but admire it.

"b'The Bunny Works REALLY has come a LONG way since the last animated film and a very medicore, & quot; King and me & quot; . Now, this dazzling new movie finally presents wonderful and well-developed characters, very professional animation, a lot of fast-paced action that no eye can follow, simply MAGNIFICENT art graphics and a very harsh message regarding xenophobia and the need to respect life. It takes place in the late 1950s, when the United States was still trapped in its fears of a cold war, a young child is left alone at home watching cheesy sci-fi movies while his pretty young mother works late into the night of the night at the local restaurant. Then he hears some strange noises, so he goes to investigate and, therefore, collides with the most unlikely friend he could ever do: a huge robot that could gobble up cars and flatten entire forest areas.

"b'+++++ This movie is based on the musical `` Cabaret \'\' (also called `` Goodbye Berlin \'\'). The music and lyrics are by the great John Kander and Fred Ebb respectively. It was run by, and the dance and music numbers were assembled by the late and great Bob Fosse. Personally, I\'m not too much for musicals, but this movie is much more than an excellent musical. I do not understand the idea that they only sing and dance. There is also a good story that delves into the corruption, decadence and false dreams of Berlin in the early 1930s when Hitler was coming to power. The story follows the life of Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) during this turbulent time. She is the so-called star of the nightclub Kit Kat who has a naughty master of ceremonies (Joel Gray). The writer Brian Roberts (Michael York) intrudes into Sally\'s world, hoping to take the vacant room in front of hers. He soon learns that it is a ball of fire and energy. Sally tells us her dream: ""I\'m going to be a great movie star"". That is, if alcohol and sex do not catch me first. `` The film alternates between real life and difficult outside of the Kit Kat nightclub and the carefree life inside, where those who attend can forget their problems and difficult times. The singing and dancing routines within the Kit Kat Klub provide a sharp counterpoint to the drama of real life abroad. Five songs from the original Broadway production did not come to the film as ""interpreted"" songs, but appear as background music. The music, the costumes, the choreography and the performance are exquisite. Especially impressive is Minnelli\'s performance, impressive on stage and equally compelling. It coincides with the fascinating performance of Gray as the Master of Ceremonies that injects humor and pathos, as well as effervescence and solidity in the procedures. The last scene of the song and dance performed by Minnelli is historical and unforgettable! This film won eight Academy Awards, including the best actress (Minnelli), best supporting actor (gray) and best director (Fosse). Finally, the DVD itself (released in 2003) is perfect in image and sound quality. It has a long list of interesting extras. In conclusion, I would recommend that you go to this cabaret (old friend). You will never want to leave! ! (1972, 2 hours, wide screen, 32 scenes) +++++'",1

"b""Have you ever said & quot; Everyone here is crazy, but I & quot; ? Then you'll love this terrifying, minimalist, low budget, and very claustrophobic 1948 thriller. Detective Richard Carlson enters an insane asylum in an attempt to find a corrupt judge who hides from justice. But before he can catch the judge, his identity is revealed and he becomes a prisoner of his own plan. And the only person who can rescue him is the double woman who sent him there! A hard-edged thriller by director Budd Boetticher (& quot; The Killer is Loose & quot; & quot; Comanche Station & quot; Bullfighter & The Lady & quot;) who would later become famous for a number of existential Westerners (The Tall T, & quot; & quot; Ride Lonesome & quot; Who are men from now & quot; etc) featuring the solitary and moral Randolph Scott adrift in an ambiguous amoral environment. Personal note: in the 70s I met the late Budd Boetticher as a friend. We went on horseback through Griffith Park in his Andalusians and made several trips to Mexico where he still practiced his dangerous and beloved art of dealing with bulls on horseback. In life and in movies, he seemed obsessed with playing the role of male antagonist in constant battle with his surroundings. Boetticher preceded the director Sam Peckinpah on issues that made the latter famous. Boetticher was real. It's great to see this early gem available on DVD.

"b""I love this movie, but the biggest problem I have is with the aspect ratio. I recently bought the movie, without noticing that it had been cut at 1.33: 1 from 1.85: 1, and finally I feel that if I'm paying for a movie, I should be the owner of everything. Too bad of me for not having reviewed the aspect ratio before the purchase, but beyond that, it is a great movie minus Coppola's dribbling in between.""",0
"b""He is a clear teacher, and the exercises are presented at the right pace. He takes his time to explain the basics of the practice, which seems a good idea for those who learn exclusively through DVD. The two songs you learn here, a classic, a bossa nova, are nice pieces, and their teaching rhythm here is a little faster. In short, it provides a lot of information beyond what one might suppose would be here. My problems with the DVD are two. On the one hand, as with other DVDs of this publisher, he is paying almost thirty dollars for sixty minutes of DVD. Traum is a good teacher too, but it seems too expensive. There are other better offers, and similar information for free on the web, so I'm not entirely happy with that. The second problem is that finger style exercises are pretty basic. I use patterns in the daily game that are more intricate than the ones he gives, and to me these seemed simple (I will certainly do them, though) and had worked harder for me. The only exercise that seemed intermediate was the arpeggios, in third and second position, which are more on the left hand than on the technique of the right hand. The two songs, however, are beyond the beginner, more intermediate. It seems to me that most of the buyers will be disappointed one or the other half of this 60-minute DVD, either boring as it was with the basic level of the exercises or intimidated by the complexity of the songs. What I would have preferred are 60 minutes of exercises, increasingly complex. I guess the average buyer would find it too boring (teach me songs!), But I'm very interested in improving and I know, by learning other instruments, that repetitive exercises are the way to do it. I wanted a DVD guide for them, instead of a printed book of them, and this is not exactly what I expected. As you point out, you could also use a selection with these exercises to work with your right hand. accuracy .""",1
"b'Armand Assante is one of my favorites. I loved all his movies. I was very surprised to see it on a doo-wap paper, but it was fantastic as always. His emotional performance of a man who lost his wife to cancer and is now dealing with the possible loss of his daughter from the same disease is heartbreaking. Her relationship with her two children also brings reality to the love of parents for their children and the torment of their previous career as a singer. He and his group of singers of the 50s were very successful, but they were soon eliminated from the main scene. For the next 30 years, he works as a bartender and his group plays for weddings. If you love doo-wap and Assante, you will love this movie. Nostalgia at its best. I recommend getting the audio CD and playing it before watching the movie, then you will really enjoy it.'",1
"b""For the great admirers of Manhunter, I would advise you to stay away from this DVD if you plan to have ... What has been announced as the & quot; Theatrical & quot; the version is in fact a poorly spliced \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bversion that awkwardly edits two scenes that had appeared at the theatrical premiere, including one of the most crucial scenes, and still has within it the most banal footage restored from the floor of the cutting room . These cuts are badly made and do not make sense to them, since they do not represent the theatrical presentation and destroy the impulse of what had been a finely edited film. I do not know if it was ignorance or arrogance, but this is the worst hacking work I've seen trying to pass itself off as a product. Whoever was in charge of this in Anchor Bay was an idiot and if I were Michael Mann, I would be calling my lawyers. & Quot; Director's Cut & quot; it is even worse in the sense that it includes the & quot; Not theatrical & quot; launch And the so-called & quot; Director's Cut & quot; - a compilation of some interesting and not so interesting shots. As a companion to a true theatrical premiere, this would have been a fascinating addition; BUT here once again, Anchor Bay finds a way to ruin what a good product should be. All the film that has not been processed in video, is stained and blurred, as if it had been transferred from a VHS tape, and a very worn one. - It is incredible that someone can have the audacity to offer this kind of cheap for the hard earned money. I saw this movie when it first came out in the theater and I considered it one of the best of that year; and I rushed to buy the LaserDisc version when it came out. When Anchor Bay released the Director's Cut DVD this year, I was on the waiting list, ready to receive the enhanced THX version with wide screen. Being intimately aware of the movie, imagine my disappointment. Do not waste your time. Wait for a better version to come out. As for those people who wish to compare the Silence of the Innocents with Manhunter, they usually prefer one above the other and their minds are practically invented at this time. I'm in Manhunter's camp. For me, I enjoyed the Silence, but I could never take it seriously, since I found the reader's notebook so caricatur- ally superhuman and, therefore, unrealistic and not very instructive. However, the Manhunter Reader is a chilling but more realistic description that impresses me every time I see it in how an evil genius manages to manipulate events outside his cell through the simple device of a telephone. This Reader is safe behind closed bars, and still manages to be a powerful presence to consider. I hope every fan and future fan of Manhunter sees it the way it came out, a fine piece of art that was slim and stylish, but that flowed with style. Siskel and Ebert rated it as one of the best films of all time, years after its release. But for now, I'm going to have my LaserDisc.""",0
"b'It\'s my fault that I had higher expectations of this movie, but I guess this movie was not made exactly for guys like me anyway. The acting is fine, the character of Matthew McConaughey Ben and Kate Hudson\'s Andie really just have to act and react. The dialogue does not matter. The character of Kate Hudson always has the top, which is fine for a while, but after an hour it becomes exhausting. She completely invades every aspect of Ben\'s life; We never see Andie\'s world, apart from her two friends and place of work. So, while both characters have a similar agenda, there is a complete imbalance of superiority, and this is the biggest deficiency of the movie for me. He endures all his attempts to ""lose"" him, but all this only produces frustration in Andie and drives her to do more crazy things. As a spectator, you\'re dying to see her fall on her face only once. But that is an illusion. Ben\'s resistance to Andie\'s antics barely entertains me, and Andie\'s total lack of shame does not make her his. Of course both look great, and Hudson smiles positively when he smiles, but man, 112 minutes is a long time to endure this game. I can imagine some people thinking that this movie is great. Girl Power and everything. I do not know . But I think we can agree that the film was conceived as a vehicle for Kate Hudson\'s rise to stardom. This film reminds me a bit of WHAT WOMEN WANT (with Mel Gibson) for a variety of reasons, especially because it was written and produced by women, that in the film world dominated by men is a much needed perspective, but Nancy Myers (the producer / director of What Women Want) is definitely much smarter than the \'brains\' behind How to lose a man in 10 days. You just have to look at the DVD extras to see evidence of this. We met two of the producers, who obviously had facelifts. I\'m serious . It is creepy . They talk about the material as if it were Shakespeare. Then there is the director Donald Petrie, who completely lacks charisma. DOING WITH HIM is so cheap that it\'s probably more fun to watch than most of the movie. While he sits there chatting, a television monitor behind him shoots still images of the film, and an office worker (with her back to the camera) stares at a static PC screen biting her nails and shaking her head. She does this for the duration of the interviews with Petrie. Oh, and did I mention the background music that accompanies the extras? It\'s music from the department store. Or elevator music. Anyone who hate more. I did not bother with the comment. Donald is boring. There are no discarded songs, which is unusual for a comedy. The deleted scenes are really good, Andie shows some honest emotions and we have some quieter private moments between the two protagonists. Look, it started well. It felt like a spongy and harmless romantic comedy, but the romance lasted about 10 minutes. I can summarize my criticism with this observation of director Petrie\'s reason why he was interested in directing the film. He says it was because he discovered that Kate Hudson was attached to that. Aha. So, basically, if the movie works well at the box office, then it will launch And its career in Hudson. I\'m sorry, Petrie, but that\'s not good enough for me.'",0
"b""As a fan of the Hellsing series, honestly, I can not say that it's worth watching this series. There is no real reason to look at this series when Hellsing Ultimate is clearly superior work. While Alucard is rude if you look at the Lower Hell OVAs and compare them to the manga in the series, you'll see that the Hellsing Ultimate OVA is a perfectly animated version of the manga. So do not waste your money on the series of impure souls since one has nothing to do with the manga and two are not even finished. Hellsing Ultimate is the only true way to enjoy Hellsing animated.""",0
"b""McLintock is a great comedy / western; the casting is perfect and the script smart and witty. However, Good Times Video treated this excellent movie with tremendous disrespect and deceived the buyers of this DVD. The ancient Greek saying of & quot; caveat emptor & quot; or & quot; let the buyer be careful & quot; It fits well here. Every time you see that the DVD comes from Good Times Video, I recommend that you spend the purchase of that article. Hopefully a REAL version of McLintock will be released soon by John Wayne's estate. This movie was not one of John Wayne's favorites and was released late for being a good movie. Hopefully, this has nothing to do with Mr. Wayne's inheritance when publishing a clear version (and with a mailbox).""",0
"b""This is the romantic comedy by which all other romantic comedies are now judged. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan have undeniable chemistry and a first class rhythm. And surprisingly so do Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher, who really have great moments that add fun to the movie. This film knows that no one knows how to present Manhattan better than Woody Allen and takes much of its traditions. Including the choice of romantic pop standards. As in Annie Hall, & quot; It had to be you & quot; it is the musical centerpiece for an inevitable coupling. The dialogue is fast and rhythmic with an ear for the sensibility of New York. And he also knows how to show favorite New York hangouts at their best. Even Billy Crystal is a bit nebbish. This film is still original and its style has been imitated innumerable times by other films with the hope of capturing a bit of its magic. Still none surpasses this. The icing on the cake was the wonderful choice to interrupt Harry's past seasons and Sally's relationship with the elderly couple who tell stories of their first encounter. The way they speak and take over the stories of others is charming and authentic and forces us to smile of recognition. When Harry met Sally it is a cheerful and very funny movie that never tires, no matter how many times you see it. It's a classic The DVD contains about 7 minutes of additional deleted footage. In this case, it is quite evident why it was eliminated. Observe it at your own risk. Rob Reiner's audio commentary seems to have been delivered at gunpoint. Do not look for many happy anecdotes or ideas about where you came up with all these great ideas. The comment track is quite slow and dry. & Quot; Making of & quot; the documentary is much more fun and insightful, so the extras are not a total wash. The sound and quality of the image are bright and exuberant, so the most important part of the album, the movie, is as pleasant as possible. When Harry met Sally he has a lot of fun with men and women trying to understand each other and makes us laugh a lot and even cry a little in the process.""",1
"b""I do not understand what constitutes a comedy these days. Here is another `` comedy '' that is not fun and focuses too much on the same tired jokes, mostly sexually related, without trying to develop any kind of argument. The performance is nothing special, the script is below average and the direction seems uninspired. What a winner! Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy play newlyweds who at the beginning of the film are coming back from what was clearly not a great honeymoon. They act like children, running between them on the walls and throwing gum into each other's hair. We return to their meeting (Kutcher hitting her in the face with a soccer ball) and the subsequent romance. He is a cemetery turn traffic reporter for a radio station, while she has had all the education possible and is an avid art lover. The honeymoon is in Europe. You should immediately realize what some of the jokes will be. How about we try to connect something from the United States to the wall when the outputs do not fit and the power is twice as strong? ... LOL . Then there are the jokes about European hygiene, with huge errors that creep on our heroes when they are in the next hotel. Driving in Europe? Then you have to buy one of those European cars with suitcases that can not be worse yellow. Oh, and there are no extra points to guess that an old Murphy flame will appear and try to steal it. In general, this movie is bad. It's not the worst I've seen, and that's why it has two stars instead of one. But this is a completely brainless narrative, we've seen it before. In general, we have seen it better.""",0

"b'Reviewers who watched the Region 2 DVD version insist that the additional 10 minutes in that version make the difference. This version loses the brand. How could I fail with Ben Elton writing and directing and Hugh Laurie and Joely Richardson in the lead roles? Answer: skip the process that the couple needs to reach an agreement with their situation. One scene ""everything is lost"" and ""presto chango"" in the next one is all solved. This leaves the main characters as cardboard cutouts for a comic plot. It is still worth watching the elegant BBC submissions, the modern London and some very funny scenes. Richardson is dazzlingly charming and Laurie is charming and wonderful. The sperm song of Laurie is a guardian. Just do not wait for that poignant moment that makes everything work: someone, somewhere, forgot to write, record or include it in this version. But, oh, I\'d love to see the Region 2 version!

"b'Like a movie, the Count of Monte Cristo is entertaining by itself, but compared to the book it is horrible. There are several cases in which Hollywood came up with the plot. The revelation about who is the real father of Albert is the worst. This did not happen in the book. The movie lacks the style of the book. The Count was much more subtle and tortuous in the book and never stooped to get his own hands. Nor do I remember any sword fighting in the book (although they were decent, but nothing spectacular).

Robert DeNiro gives his best performance as a completely depraved and tormenting slave merchant who truly repents. This is a beautiful story of grace, since DeNiro tries to pay the ransom of his guilt and begins to discover the mercy and unconditional love of God. At the same time, questions arise about the reasons for missionary work. They should be inspired by the love of God, but other aspirations have been the impetus for many throughout history. As in the Crusades, there were some very good Christians with intentions, but there were also many who killed and conquered in the name of a loving God.

I've had years of ballet training, I'm in good shape and I respect Gwenyth's lifestyle choices, so I bought the DVD. The method may be effective, but you must be able to learn the routines. It would have helped the presentation and it would have been more professional to have presented the steps by name (either French, for example, glisade, jete or English, for example, slide, change). Then, after allowing the students to break it down with their backs to them [what TA does], it would have been fun and effective if each routine had adjusted to the music as the students' `performed '' the speed. Instead, the 8 routines are presented first, each one seen from the front, from the back, slowly, quickly and without music.

Focusing on Ally (Flockhart), perpetually single, slender and crazy, the audience is attracted by her hallucinations (brilliantly done through an impressive computer animation), her loves, her losses and her work in a law firm that seems embrace the strange. What made this show great was that it was very different, with the crisp writing of David E. Kelley bringing a mix of well-placed observations on modern relationships and absolutely hilarious characters. Who could forget John Cage (McNicol), the diminutive lawyer with a pet frog and a crush on Barry White? Add to this Richard Fish, who seems to wallow in his own male chauvanism, 'Subzero' Nelle (diRossi) and the deliciously nasty Ling (Liu) and you have a hot cast that is very nice whatever it is you are doing. Although the last episodes have been criticized for not being funny enough, this might seem unfair, although there is always a tendency to feel nostalgic for the older episodes offered here.

"b""Down Argentine Way is a type of light and delicious food from the early 1940s that should delight anyone who loves this type of film. We have excellent performances of great stars like Betty Grable, Don Ameche, Carmen Miranda and the incredible dance of Nicholas Brothers! The plot is advancing at a good pace and the performance was quite convincing. The action begins when horse lover Glenda Crawford (Betty Grable) and her mother Binnie Crawford (Charlotte Greenwood) are on the racetrack once again. It seems that the Crawford family has always loved horses and they also compete with them. Glenda sees a good racehorse and wants to buy the horse; however, the problem is that the horse belongs to the bad-tempered Don Diego Quintana (Henry Stephenson), who has a long and somewhat stupid personal resentment against Willis Crawford, the patriarch of the Crawford family. Anyway, Glenda and Binnie go to Argentina after their first attempt to buy horses from Quintana does not work very well. It is not long before Glenda falls in love with Quintana's son, Ricardo Quintana (Don Ameche), who is equally delighted with Glenda. The young couple tries to pass Glenda Crawford to Don Quintana as Glenda Cunningham in the hope that she will like it and then does not care if she is a Crawford; but that also has its complications. Meanwhile, there is a horse bred to compete: Don Quintana will let the horse race take place? It's a weak subplot, but the few horse races we see in this movie improve the action; And that's fine by me! Look for some excellent numbers of songs and dances, remember, these plots were practically excuses for the studio to record fabulous numbers of songs and dances. Rumor has it that after the audience first saw The Nicholas Brothers dancing, they applauded so much that the projectionist had to rewind the film to show his scene again! Charlotte Greenwood also scores big with her almost incredible ability to kick with her legs while dancing happily in another number. Betty Grable also dances very well. In addition, this film marks the cinematographic debut of Carmen Miranda; She sings a couple of songs during the movie, as well as a short song at the beginning of the movie. Carmen shines even when they were not performing as much as they did in later films! The DVD comes with a superlative extra about the life and times of Betty Grable. She really looked like an especially sweet girl who did not really want too much of life and enjoyed her private family life as best she could. The quality of the photographs in the Betty Grable extra is excellent. There is also a commentary in progress but optional for people who want to know what happened behind the scenes while filming this movie. Excellent ! In general, Down Argentine Way is a musical that is worth seeing. I usually reserve five stars for an MGM musical; But this time Fox really did it right! Fans of movie musical classics can not miss this one!""",1

The previous review, the review of Amazon I was struck by stating that the fight scene was stupid because the fight was stimulated by a puppy. And if I had not seen the movie, I probably would have agreed that fighting for a puppy is a pretty stupid story, however, if you look at the scene, it's actually quite moving, hear that the dogs die and then present a view of an innocent puppy going to a cold-blooded killer and stirring something inside the cleric. I could continue longer, however, I will not, I will conclude this review by saying that this is a very high quality magic movie. Action scenes to have fun, a story that will make you feel grateful for the emotions and an ending that will make you smile from ear to ear. If you want to spend your money well, it will be wise to spend it on a film of this caliber.""",1
"b""I was disappointed with this DVD. I have dance experience and I was able to pick up all the routines fairly quickly. Those who do not have background baggage are ready for a big challenge (but it is feasible if you are diligent and patient with yourself). Make sure you have a large space to do this: you will not actually work to live in a condominium if you have neighbors under you and are jumping up and down. My other criticism is that during the cardio warm up, Tracy changes what she is doing and does not verbalize enough what she is doing. For example, you stretch your hamstring muscles with your head hanging down (so you can not watch TV), you are in that pose for a while, then you look up and Tracy is doing something else ... What? he ? ? ? She did not even say that she was moving. I feel that she is not very good with the details. I also noticed this on his DVD Mat (very frustrating on that DVD). Also, I do not think she is very motivating or enthusiastic. She is quite introverted to make these DVDs. I was thinking that she could be like Jillian from The Biggest Loser ... Maybe I'll watch the next video of Jiffian's Shred. I last sold my Tracy Anderson DVDs on eBay and recovered the full price.""",0

"b""It seems that no other Broadway musical was transferred so intact to the screen with every facet of its brilliant and gloriously theatrical production in its staging. River City, Iowa, of course, does not look more realistic than the Land of Oz, but that's how it should be. It's a satire, and fortunately director Morton DaCosta keeps everything in perfect condition, preserved to play exactly as he did on stage, even with respect to the opening number aboard a train where all the vendors sing about a certain scoundrel posing as a music teacher. The music of Jeremy Willson never sounded so good and was given singing and dancing by ROBERT PRESTON, SHIRLEY JONES, PAUL FORD and HERMIONE GINGOLD on the tracks, all of which are helped and stimulated by some of the best. singing and dancing you could ask in a musical of this type. Gingold is outrageously funny and Paul Ford, like her husband, the mayor of River City, is equally boisterous in a comedic role. But it's Preston's show from start to finish with her co-star Shirley Jones in good vocal form as the skeptical librarian. One of the best prepared numbers is the number `` Marian, The Librarian '' which takes place in the city's library where poles and sliding balconies become part of the intricately organized dance routine. All the musical numbers are interpreted with professional charm by a talented group of actors / singers / dancers who are part of the citizenship of River City. Little Ron Howard, the child with lisp, who later went on to fame as a director, is a standout as Jones' little brother.

"b'In the late 70\'s, I was stuck in the Moonie cult for a while in Northern California.

Yay pow"". (Yes, they really used that!) Enforced conformity, The famous game of dodging balls with songs.

"b'To be honest, I saw the movie because of the talent behind it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with virtually every aspect of this movie. There are times when the action bounces back and forth between two sets of characters and situations (the Fifth Element) but there is little or no connection between the two situations, which leaves me dizzy and confused instead of entertained or stimulated. There is a development of extreme character, like the many times we see Peggy (Laura Dern) gliding to take a bite of her flask or pour herself a drink. The idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bher alocholism is hit in my conscience to the point of annoying me, and then I discovered that the fact that she has a problem of substance abuse has nothing to do with the plot, the interaction of the character or anything else. Why did Robert Altman make a big part of that then? Filling? The obsession with the Kennedy family by Connie (the character of Tara Reid) is another case in which a great deal of time is spent trying to show us this side of the character and is never followed for any tangible purpose later in the film. . Oddly enough, she is probably one of the most ""normal"" women in the picture. All this would have led to a mediocre movie, but the ending really killed me. I have no idea what the end is supposed to mean. In fact, it reinforces the idea that the whole plot was derived by the writers who completed several pages of Mad Libs and then edited them in a script. There really is no other explanation for why so many aspects of the film seem to be so random (or chaotic at best).'",0

"b""I am a fan of any movie or work that is historical, and this definitely fits the time when women had few rights. Sometimes we have to look back in history to see how we have progressed since those times. Women have come a long way for their independence and the right to live their lives in their own way. I would suggest to parents to let their children know how lucky they are to be able to choose the man they would like to marry, not what is good for the family. Marriages were organized and most marriages were considered only biblical roommates. Men have always had their lover to turn to when their wife is not available (pregnant) and if they have been expelled from their wives' beds and considered to be in the dog house. The film really portrayed how little control women had over their future. Now about the movie ... it's the real story about this duchess and her life. I thank you because someone put a real historical piece like the Duchess. I would recommend that everyone watch this movie and know how blessed we are today to make our own decisions in life, whether good or bad.""",1

The movie was not satisfactory anyway; It left me with an incomplete feeling. The only thing that was up to the task, in my opinion, was the performance.

"b'The Golden Army: an army made to keep humanity under control because humanity has a problem with consuming everything that surrounds it. Of elven thought and design of goblins, it has the power to do things that only the desperate, or a madman, would like. The elven figure that comes out, divides his toy and lets the army rust. Unfortunately for humanity, rust is an arbitrary word and the Golden Army is something that never stopped being a threat. And when the powerplay begins to emerge, the BPRDs are the only ones that have the skills to stop it. When I heard what was the source material of the film, I knew that the director / Migola knew what they were doing, but it scared me a little. I say this because Hellboy II was creatively based on a novelization between Christopher Golden and Mike Mignola and does not really reflect Hellboy. I had a good idea and some good creature characteristics but, in the end, the book was a mild disappointment. Fast-forward to the book and see what a good director could do with something that needs a golden touch (sorry for the play on words). The toothfairies, Wink, the elemental, the goblin, the angel (if you want to understand that little beast and what it says more, take a look at the background story of Anung A Rama and the way the beast was created. it takes place in a short story and highlights some lovely little things that a person must see so they really understand everything) and all the intermediate characters. Fortunately, the casting has always been good, the direction is fabulous, and Hellboy is portrayed in the same way that Hellboy is portrayed. This means that he thinks with his fist, has a gun the size of a small man, and is not really filled with a small thing called respect. As for what the movie offers, let me say that I had a bit of everything. The action was pretty good, the human elements (and I use it vaguely) of the story were fantastic, and the film explored a little more than the BRPD is. They allowed viewers to take snapshots of each person, their tastes and desires, and added a new character that translated strangely from book to video, but translated well as a character. Ron is a perfect Hellboy, too, and let this shine in this new installment. In the part with the elemental you can see how much it is affected, and in the fights with specific beings you can say that you do not want to hurt them. He wants to be loved by all and understands the difficult situation of the things that ""threaten"" humanity. Del Toro adding that in incredible because that\'s one of the Hellboy things in the books, enough for him and BPRD to really have some major problems. If you like Hellboy and you want a movie about it, this is good. job . I know there have been many complaints here and there about certain aspects of the film, but Hellboy is a solid follow-up and the fans of the novels / the first movie will have fun. If you pay special attention to the details involved, you will find all sorts of good things hidden in the background, allowing you to take a look at what Anung A Rama is fighting like a human made by demons for their own choices. You can also see the potential elements that could have ramifications for the world and for all who inhabit it. I liked that too. Combine that with MUCH more (we even get a comic that moves to keep the ADD watchers in us satiated), and you have a second aid that explores what the first movie could only build. Very dear'",1
"b""I thought I had found a gem ... A DVD that covered the performances of one of the metal pioneers ... the first years of one of the best bands of all time. Mmm no .

The few performances you get in any of these dogs. It has a terrible A / V quality. My expectations were never high regarding the A / V according to the time they were recorded.

The price of this release is a joke for the junk content you get. This shit is not worth a dime in my opinion for the little interesting information elements of Deep Purple that you get during the whole set. Deep Purple fans are not fooled.

"b""First I have to say this. If you expect a story or a hero like Spider-Man, a shock awaits you. The cut of the directors of Daredevil is one of the best cuts of directors that I have seen in my life. The plot not only has more content with the addition of deleted scenes, but also ties the gaps of the plot. There was also a complete subplot about blind lawyer Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) and Foggy Nelson (Jon Faverou) defending what appears to be a guilty client, played by rapper Coolio 90. In this cut, you'll see Matt Murdock more, and you In fact, I see why Mark Steven Johnson chose Affleck to act as a blind watchman. When I first saw the original version, I thought Affleck was fine. But after this, I can say that Affleck was the perfect choice for Daredevil / Matt Murdock. But I still have to say that Collin Farrell as Bullseye steals the show. Not only did he invite him to tea, he also made Bullseye a more interesting character than he is in the comic series. The cut of the R rated director also has a stronger and darker edge for the film, compared to the PG 13 rating that the original version has. Expect more scenes of graphic fights, and many more oaths by the characters. In general, I must say that this court definitely does justice to comic book fans. If you do not have this in your collection, get it. This DVD also has a good mini documentary about how the directors' cut was made.""",1

"b'Every time a film shoots for ""realism,"" it generally opens the door to a predictable set of signifiers: handheld cameras, real locations, a naturalistic lighting scheme, street dialogue and tortured theatrical methodology. In only two functions, Funny Ha Ha and the new Mutual Appreciation, the writer and director Andrew Bujalski has reconfigured the language to something much closer to the real one. His dialogue of aesthetic DIY and semi-improvisation has earned him a frequent comparison with John Cassavetes, but he does not care so much about acute emotion; the characters in his films are clumsy and inexpressive to the point where they can not say what they feel, at least not without first having found out. Mutual Appreciation is not much more than a refinement of Funny Ha Ha, following a similar group of idle twenty-somethings while struggling with relationship problems and trying to give some life to their lives. And yet, it\'s equally strange to see, because Bujalski\'s stylized dialogue type sounds genuinely fly-on-the-wall style. The carelessly charismatic Justin Rice plays a musician who moves to New York right after his band breaks up, which puts him in a strange place, as he will play later in the week. Once in town, Rice reconnects with her friend Bujalski, a good-natured graduate student, and Bujalski\'s girlfriend, Rachel Clift, whom Rice begins to develop a tacit (and, by the way, mutual) attraction. Meanwhile, Rice finds a champion and more in the attractive college radio DJ Seung-min Lee, but gets into trouble when he brings Lee\'s brother as his drummer and tries to get away from her romantically. All this intrigue creates a romantic atmosphere. encounter between Rice and Clift, and a serious rupture in its relation with Bujalski, but nothing in Mutual Appreciation goes in agreement with the habitual script. The scene in which Rice and Clift finally vocalize their feelings for each other is the perfect example of what Bujalski does so well: any other romantic melodrama would make them fizzle with passion, but these characters are painfully hesitant and credible, given that They both betray someone they care about. What ends up happening between them is completely unexpected, but totally true for who they are and how the most affectionate people would act. But such things seldom happen on screen, and Bujalski\'s willingness to move on makes him a unique talent.'",1

"b'God, this movie really stirred my stomach for its entire duration. Like atmospheric films, this is undoubtedly a masterpiece. It is quite a cooler and depends on the mood and a spooky atmosphere instead of frights and violence. The film is set in an old Jersey house shortly after World War II. Nicole Kidman plays the owner of the house, who lives there with her two children all the time waiting for her husband to return home after the war. At the beginning of the war. Three servants of the film arrive to help. They are still the only characters that really care about the movie. Nicole Kidman is excellent on paper, as are the two small children. Children suffer from a rare condition in which they can not be exposed to any strong light. This causes the dark scenes where the film is almost completely set in the candlelight. To prevent children from being exposed to any light, all doors in each room must be locked and unlocked when entering. the film is spent with the opening and loss of these rooms, as there is a strange presence in the house. In many ways, some of these scenes recall scenes from The Sixth Sense. As the story reveals the background of these char servants, it also begins to unfold. It gives the movie an incredibly intriguing feeling that made me feel constantly on edge during its duration. He never seems to be sure where this whole story leads, so the sense of mystery is quite unique. When they leave the house, the outside is covered by this almost surrealistic fog, which recreates a beautiful atmosphere. It reminded me of those Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes movies that used to give me chills as a child. the sun would rise only to temporarily raise the atmosphere to give the spectator a break from all this tension. The rhythm really accumulates when the film reaches a very, very dramatic conclusion. Beautifully filmed, really Gothic, brilliantly acted and worth seeing.'",1

Andie MacDowell was probably best known for her modeling career in 1993, that as an actress ... she does a simply wonderful job as `` Rita \'\', the television producer. Chris Elliot does a good job in a less annoying role than he used to as ""Larry"" the cameraman (it has come a long way since it was ""The Man Under The Stairs"" in David Letterman). The other actor that really impresses is the man with the recognizable face, but what\'s his name (Stephen Tobolowsky as life insurance salesman Ned `` Bing \'\' Ryerson). Oh, and Scooter the marmot. As for the story, Bill Murray is stuck on the same cold day (which happens to be Groundhog Day) in Punxsutawney, PA that covers the now famous celebrations. He keeps reliving the same day, again and again. Every day he sees the same things. Every day he meets the same people ... the man in the hallway early in the morning, Doris the waitress, the mayor of the city, etc. He decides to get the best out of the situation and do what he wants ... only because he knows that he will wake up the next day and will be the same day one more time. While he tires of reliving the same day over and over again, Connors changes his focus to Rita. First, trying to impress her. So, trying to really take care of her. When it finally reaches her, the spell breaks and appears the next day. I classify some of Bill Murray\'s movies as classic ... that is. `` Caddyshack \'\', `` Stripes \'\', `` Scrooged \'\', `` What About Bob \'\', etc ... but I put `` Groundhog Day \'\' at the top of the list. An easy choice for my favorite movie Bill Murray # 1. It\'s also an easy choice for one of my best 4-5 comedies of all time. *****'",1

"b'One of the most delicious movies of recent years, `` Calendar Girls \'\', a far-away version of `` The Full Monty \'\', is the true story of a group of middle-aged English women who became international celebrities when They designed and posed for a nude fundraising calendar that sold millions of copies worldwide. Julie Walters and Helen Mirren head a wonderful cast, with Walters as a woman whose husband dies of leukemia and Mirren as her best friend, who comes up with the idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bthe calendar as a way to honor her memory and raise money for the local hospital. . The risk of any ""feel good"" comedy is that it will become cloying, shy or corny. Fortunately, `` Calendar Girls \'\' has an enormously ingenious script and top-level performances by its highly talented cast. Each one of the `` girls \'\' is given its own unique personality so that we see them not only as a group, united in this inspiring effort, but also as people who work through their own personal demons to complete the project . Women face expected roadblocks in the form of ""disapproved"" and disapproved voices in the community, but their belief in the wisdom of their cause rules out all those problems. This charming film offers laughs more genuine and direct than any other comedy of recent times. `` Calendar Girls \'\' is comforting, touching and inspiring, and what more could you want from a \'\' feel good \'\' movie than that?'",1

"b'Let me first say that in terms of the quality of the image on this DVD, I would rate it with 4 stars. However, the content of this DVD compensates for the quality of the image. It\'s not that the image is bad, I just feel that during the remastering some of the clips could have been much clearer. With that aside, let me tell you that this is a super DVD to have in your collection. From now on, it\'s the only place where you can find something from & quot; I love Lucy & quot; available on DVD, and this is the only place where the clips from & quot; Here is Lucy & quot; It can be found . If you want to relive many of Lucy\'s favorite moments from the past, this is the place to go. Here you can find some of the classics such as the famous Vitameatavegamin, or the candy factory, or even the moment when Lucy and Vivian (in ""The Lucy Show"") installed the shower and were trapped while filling up with more and more water The good thing about this DVD is that it helps remind the viewer why Lucille Ball was / is as important as it has been, and probably will be, for the world of television and entertainment. I hope that the folks at Paul Brownstein Productions will start releasing more rare Lucille Ball shows, like their 1977 special. ""Lucy calls the president & quot; that brought her together with many of her co-stars like Gale Gordon and Vivian Vance. , as fanatics, we must let the companies that hold the rights to these programs know that there is a demand for them, and transmit the simple message that it is ""Time to open the vaults! & quot;'",1

"b""Seeing `` The smell of green papaya? it's like listening to a harmonious song. There is not much dialogue in this movie, but you will not feel bored. I enjoy the calm, elegant and elegant humor of the film. It uses many simple melodies and close-ups in the film to reflect the mood of the characters. The visual and auditory beauty provides comfort when looking at it. The first part of the film takes place in 1951, when the French authority almost came to an end. French has occupied Vietnam for more than 30 years before 1954. During the French administration, people in Vietnam had been influenced by the French. In the first half of the film, Mui lived in a traditional family as a servant. The grandmother lost her husband when she was still a teenager and she insisted on praying for her husband every morning and staying faithful to him. The father left home with another woman and took all the money a few times, but the mother never blamed him. Instead, the grandmother blamed her for not knowing how to please her own husband. In the second half of the film, Mui moved to a musician's house as a servant as well. The musician, who is also his teacher, called Khuyen, has been influenced by the French and knows how to play the piano. His house was decorated in French style, colorful and bright. Unlike the previous family, simple, old and all in wood. Khuyen was engaged, but then discovered that Mui was very attractive after getting dressed. He fell in love with her and then broke up with her boyfriend? and he married Mui. This film shows the difference between a traditional Vietnamese family and a modern Western family. Not only the environment of life has a great difference, but also the perception of relationships.""",1

"b'Comment: I did not expect to like this movie ... I just wanted to see the technical aspects such as ""stop motion"" and 3D qualities. This movie was so well done, paying special attention to the details that I was impressed (in a good way). After seeing the ""extras"", I was again impressed with the tremendous amount of work involved in doing one of these final action movies ... it\'s amazing. The story and the situations became spooky ... (button eyes) and can be a bit intense for younger children. For the ""mature"" viewers ... whether you look at the 3D version or the ""normal"" version, I think a pleasant surprise awaits you. 3D performance: 3D was ""stellar"" on this album. As good or better than in the theater. Most 3D Blu-ray discs have a problem with `` convergence \'\' that is best explained as `` ghost stereo effect \'\' to objects in the background. It can be as little as 2% up to about 20%. This movie was absolutely perfect. This is the disc that I now use for my `` golden master \'\' of 3D perfection. Now I am asking: `` If you can do such a perfect job in this movie ... why not all the 3D movies \'\'? Disk performance: this disk was perfectly executed.

"b""With better direction and acting, I think * Foxy Brown * could have been an incredible movie. As it is, it's almost a decent plot full of distractions caused by a parade of the terrible and scandalous performance of the 70s (the last of which, however, is really an almost enough reason to watch the movie) .Pam Grier , in spite of his great daring attitude and confidence in the screen, he seems plagued by terrible delivery of his lines. (There is no success, but there are several attempts to deliver some decent ones). Fortunately, however, Grier's lack of flexibility is overshadowed by the horrible performance of Katheryn Loder, who could have given one of the worst performances I've ever had. I've ever seen an actress. None of the actors, however, seems particularly talented, being the best Juanita Brown, the singer Claudia and Antonio Fargas, the perfectly inept, Foxy's bully brother, Link. It's still a decent movie, although it may not be one you want to put too high on your `` must see '' list. If fashion does not appeal to you, it's worth looking at Grier's great action scenes and the amount of laughable and seemingly endless random sexual situations found here. If you are a fan of the '70s chic, Pam Grier or Blaxploitation movies, it is an absolute necessity. Otherwise, rent it if you like violence and can not find any Tarantino movies.""",0

I knew from the commercials of the film that I was going to be different (that is, Becky & co being American, set in New York, etc.), but boy, I had no idea how different the movie would be. I feel that the differences really ruined the movie too. In the film, Luke is a total schlub, works for a magazine, and it's all about the fashion magazine. None of that happens in books, nor Suzy and Tarkie get married until later. It was a total train disaster. Do yourself a favor and read the books instead!""",0

"b'Welcome to The Rileys attracted me more and more as the movie progressed; At first I thought it was a bit slow, but when the pace soared against the backdrop of New Orleans, I was quite impressed by what I had to say. The casting could not have been better; Melissa Leo offers an excellent performance as a guilty housewife punishing herself for a car accident a long time ago that took the life of her daughter; and James Gandolfini presents a masterful performance as her husband Doug, who seems unable to overcome his pain and his personal demons. Choreography and cinematography improve the film and the musical score also does a great job in making the film even better. Lois Riley (Melissa Leo) and her husband Doug (James Gandolfini) are still very unhappy despite the fact that eight years have passed. years since the death of his daughter in a car accident. Lois has not left the house since the car accident; in fact, Lois has been so depressed that she already has tombstones for herself and Doug by the grave of her dead daughter, a fact that gives Doug chills. Doug also has a long relationship with a waitress named Vivian (Eisa Davis). However, when Vivian suddenly dies of a heart attack, Doug is very upset and still sad; and he suffers in silence because he does not know that Lois already knew about him and Vivian for quite some time. Doug goes to a business convention in New Orleans; and still annoyed by the death of Vivian (who had wanted to take her there for his birthday) and also feeling out of place in a city very different from where he lives with his wife, Doug leaves the convention early one day and goes into a fringe where he meets a minor prostitute who has several different names, including Mallory (Kristen Stewart of the fame of `` Twilight \'\'). Doug and Mallory start an unconventional relationship; She reminds Doug of her daughter. So, what does Doug do? Call Lois to tell her that she will stay in New Orleans indefinitely without giving Lois any reason; he moves in with Mallory paying her $ 100 per day to stay with her in her badly damaged apartment in a house that was abandoned after Hurricane Katrina and Doug desperately tries to get Mallory to grow up with a combination of love and confrontation that Mallory needs. Meanwhile, Lois finally decides to leave home after nearly eight years of staying indoors: she is determined to go to New Orleans and find Doug there by calling him on his cell phone. Of course, the rest of what happens gives us a very solid story and good entertainment. I could tell you more; but there will not be spoilers here, although it may seem like I already told you too much! Suffice it to say that the rest of the plot should keep their attention very well. Also, look for very good performances by Tiffany Coty as Tara and Lance E. Nichols in a brief presentation as Hamilton ""Ham"" Watkins, another entrepreneur at the convention. The DVD also includes an extra on the making of the film. I recommend this movie for anyone interested in family drama or drama in general; and, of course, the fanatics of the actors in this movie would do well to add this to their collections.'",1
"b""One Body Too Many a black and white film from 1944 is not an especially good movie. BUT, it's a funny movie. It is a silly horror movie / comedy type B that became the meat and potatoes of so many early studies. I love him . Jack Haley is Albert Tuttle a nose for the stone insurance man who has a date with an old rich inmate. He arrives at his mansion and is seen by the butler (Bela Lugosi). He shows up at his client's office and immediately begins his speech towards the back of a chair and the smoke that comes out of a lit cigar. However, without Tuttle knowing, the client is dead and in his coffin in the office. Tuttle places his briefcase on the closed casket before realizing what is in the room. When you try to leave, you can not open the door, etc. This movie is full of all imaginable clich\xc3\xa9s. But that's fun. A huge, dark creepy house, a desire to read, a suspicious looking butler and cook, a beautiful damsel in distress, a naive detective, a house full of greedy members of the family of the deceased, murders, trap doors, screams and night noises, etc. Of course, a very nervous and reluctant hero. This kind of movie would be nothing without Lyle Talbot and he is here as the family member who thinks that the shy Jack Haley has something to hide. I've had this movie for years and from time to time I dust it off to see it again because sometimes you need some harmless fun. (~. ~)""",0

"b'Was JK embarrassed by this error? Egad this was really a disappointment, and the illusion that it was a good movie, or five stars, is in line with having Potter as a label.

A badly executed script, the CGI was a teenager, in a world now dominated by mass-traded processors and the like, you think they would have called Stan Wintson in a bit of fun, this was really a first year in the kind of work the New York Film Academy. The plot was acerebral. Rupert Grint is made of wood, plastic and insignificant. There was absolutely no jumpstreet character development, nor did it suspense. We are united in believing that because it is Harry Potter, it is going to be good. I am a great admirer of the series of books, and, naturally, the books are usually better than the movies, but [this] compared to the book, it was a real failure. Personally, I consider that Branagh is an excellent actor of methods, he played a good Hamlet and his films are very ingenious and distinctive, however, the error here is evident, since he was immovable and common. In conclusion, the whole package seemed hasty, irrelevant, unlike the world feeling of Rowling\'s epics? , and as ""Running With Scissors"" by Augusten, definitely adhere to the book.

"b""This is two episodes of the Storybook theater series of Shirley Temple. IMDB lists the episode of Babes in Toyland from 1960. It stars Angela Cartwright, Jonathan Winters, Joe Besser, Jerry Colonna and, of course, Shirley Temple. Compared to the Disney version of '61 or '62, this is a much weaker show. Nor is it as good as the version of Laurel and Hardy (also known as March of the Wooden Soldiers) of the 30s. The main value of this DVD is as an example of a simpler time, when television could get away with it (think high school production values) establishes, writes and acts minimally, and calls it entertainment. The story bears little resemblance to any version of Babes in Toyland that I have seen. The dancers seem rehearsed, and the actors assail blatantly. The children actors have to contain the laughter before the antics of the adults and the failures of the accessories. The segment of Winnie the Pooh is a bit better, made with puppets by Bill and Cora Baird, who made the sequence `` Lonely Cabrera '' in Sound of Music. . It would be good for children to look.""",0

Everyone else seemed to appear to win an easy salary check by donning costumes and playing with blood geysers during the so-called action sequences. The only saving grace was the fact that it was so bad that he could not help but laugh and wonder: Was Michael Madsen really drunk during the whole shooting of the movie? If it is really true, it would be very useful to explain how badly his performance was, and if that is the case, maybe the rest of the cast joined him in silence. Anyway, I've never played video games, so I can not compare it with that, all I can say is that, as an independent film, it was a waste of money.""",0

Documentaries are made to provoke emotion, be it happiness or pain. , hate, love or whatever, documentaries are made for that reason. This succeeded completely, however, not in the way I imagined it. I could not help thinking how dishonorable this family is for D Ray White and West Virginia. They openly boast of shooting people, killing people, selling drugs, prescription drug scams and inhaling pills in front of their newborn baby (which CPS removes, thank God). It disgusted me, but that is what this documentary was intended to do. I loved it, I'm a big fan of Jesco White and I thought it was as good as The Dancing Outlaw. I feel that Dickhouse Pictures exploited this dysfunctional family in the name of 'Legacy', which I think is legitimate ... but not great. I definitely recommend it totally, however, it plays as part of the 'Intervention' episode, part COPS and part Gummo. Sometimes it seemed a bit fake, however, the fact that it was really a kind of shock for a second. If that makes sense. It's basically like a car accident.

"b'CHARLOTTE SOMETIMES is a night of a movie, a story that gently meanders through the lives of four people and with very few words says a lot about human relationships, about the cocoons that we turn on ourselves for security, for protection against fear, to wait for the chrysalis to metamorphose into a butterfly or moth. Eric Byler is praiseworthy for having the courage to keep this story simple: a story of four personality ""upsets"" and how they find the means to exist in this strange world. Michael Idemoto is perhaps the most lonely on the outside, but the four characters seem to crave the connection and simply can not stick. Eugenia Yuan is the idiosyncratic girl, Jacquelyn Kim is the mystery woman who with Matt Westmore interprets more a catalytic agent than a character. The four actors are beautiful, sensitive and convincing. The lighting and the configuration are well chosen. In general, this small independent film is a silent distraction, which deals more with what is not said than with just a script.'",1

"b""I think that in the next few decades, when film school students study the history of American animation, Iron Giant will be perhaps the last great example of traditional hand-drawn animated films, before the switch to computerized animation to search of Nemo. The saddest thing What happens with this film is that when it was originally released in cinemas, its promotion was so little financed and simply bad, that it was not very successful. Fortunately, he has received devout followers on VHS and DVD. This movie is an example of what animated films usually achieve in Japan, but they rarely do it here in the United States. It is well written, it is visually impressive and it works for all ages, not only for children. Keep in mind that it may not be suitable for very young children. The climactic battle sequence presents a potentially terrifying transformation of the Iron Giant. Do not get me wrong, this movie is suitable for everyone, but younger viewers and most very young children can probably handle it well. But some children are more sensitive and prone to nightmares than others, so if you have children under 6, I suggest you watch the movie before you allow them to watch it. Some films are better rented, others are better bought. This is in the last category: it is a guardian! If you are an adult who has canceled animated films like `` children's things '' because they tend to be trivial and formulaic, you owe it to yourself to watch this movie.

"b'I have been watching this animated program for the last 10 years, now I am 20 years old. Honestly, I can say that I still can not find anything wrong with Gargoyles. With a captivating story, an adorable cast and wonderful music, I give this show a 2-thumbed look. I am happy that, after 10 long years, I can finally have the gargoyles in my house. BRAVO Disney!'",1
"b""After spying this series on the shelves of my local library and seeing that it was an aspiring chef established in 1900-1910 in London, I collected all the volumes. This series really surprised me: it has a strong writing and attention to the environment. . Louisa Trotter is an open cockney cook who makes her way in her profession and in British society with a lot of coda, an understanding of human nature and some luck. Gemma Jones is great because Louisa Trotter and the supporting cast are also very solid. At first I was not sure if this series was a miniseries or a television series (It's TV), but it is rather Dickensian since each episode is based on the previous one. And I can pay a series without a higher complement than saying that conflict resolutions are not trivial or superficial. Many allusions to historically precise facts, politics and contemporary culture are woven into the stories. I feel that I learned more about the English classicism and the social customs of the `` Duchess '' and the Bentinck Hotel than about my semester abroad in London. If you like vintage drama (and comedy) and strong and nuanced heroines with many battles to fight, then you'll like `` The Duchess of Duke Street. '' This series stands the test of time. My only complaint is that I did not learn much about the culinary arts, but the writing is so above standard that my complaint becomes inconsequential. Although this series began filming in 1976, production values \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bmake it difficult to locate. The Duchess of Duke Street is comparable in quality to the Pride and Prejudice of the 1979 BBC.""",1
"b'While this is an excellent adaptation of the first 24 chapters more or less than J.K. Rowling\'s book, the initial releases of Harry Potter\'s home videos continue to disappoint with its astonishingly scarce bonus materials and lack of documentaries. It is obvious that this film, including its current special features, will finally be released as: 1. An `` Ultimate Edition \'\' with new special features, 2. In a `` Complete movie collection \'\' with all other movies, and 3. Possibly as an ""Extended Edition"" combined with Part 2. So, why in the world would it be foolish to pay $ 15-25 for this now? If you are an unconditional fan who simply can not wait to have this, I guess I understand, but you just have to rent it and save your money for later. Otherwise, this is a blatant attempt by Warner Bros. to continually get people out of their money. And that\'s not great with me.'",0

"b""After having seen this movie several times, I definitely have to rate Gigi as one of the most charming musicals ever made. The delightful score, by Lerner & Loewe, includes songs like `` I Remember It Well '', `` The Night They Invented Champagne '', '' Thank Heaven For Little Girls '', and the song that gives title to the album, `` Gigi '', sung with surprising candor and seriousness by Louis Jourdan. The three directors, Leslie Caron, Louis Jourdan and Maurice Chevalier, along with the Paris locals help maintain a distinctive French flavor, especially in the way the characters relate and interact. For all those who have commented on the political impropriety of the story, a closer look will reveal the true feminist perspective of Colette's work, which was a pioneer at the time: 1) the story is a commentary on limited social and economic options for women out of wedlock (or prostitution for that matter) during the turn of the century, 2) Although Gigi (Caron) never fully masters her lessons and preparation, she is able to capture the heart of Gaston (Jourdan) precisely because of her imperfections, and 3) most importantly, it is Gaston instead of Gigi who is forced to truly transform and challenge the social conventions of the time to bring history to its resolution. Compare this with My Fair Lady, which offers similar social commentary, but is resolved in a more standard way; Although Professor Higgins finally realizes his love for Eliza in the end, it is Eliza who is forced to submit his will to make a reconciliation that does nothing to resolve any of the issues raised in the scenes prior to that point. Definitely go to Gigi and judge for yourself. (Make sure you see only the widescreen version!) The full-screen version is awful, with full characters cut out from some scenes, like Hermione Gingold in most of the `'I Remember It Well '' sequence.""",1

"b'The Limey is probably the best work of Soderbergh, beats Traffic and Erin Brockovich with ease, only Out of Sight and Sex, Lies and Videotape are close. The Limey is one of the only movies I\'ve seen where the stylistic possibilities of the film make the film not only a piece of indulgent art to be debated in film classes, but a moving film that resonates and stays with you. Terence Stamp plays the main character Wilson as a tough and sad English criminal trying to find out what happened to his daughter. Your search has gender fundamentals, but this movie rises above any gender label. It takes a lot of credit for the Lem Dobbs script, which dodges the clich\xc3\xa9 and injects a good comedy into the mix. But the editing style of this movie is what I love, it works on waves like ""memorys"", it\'s the only movie I\'ve seen that shows precisely how your mind can change from one thing to another. Right now, I\'m sounding like an art student with chins dominated by his own personal importance. But watch the movie and you\'ll see what I mean. The best part of this movie is that it\'s sad, the ending is not a big spin or a copy, it\'s just sad, and there are not many movies that evoke that feeling in me today. I\'ve finished .'",1
"b""This old television special consists of 10 cartoons, using only about 3 minutes of that caricature. I would have got 5 stars if the cartoons were complete. For some inexplicable reason, the Easter Bunny calls the grandmother to tell her that she is sick and that she can not distribute the Easter eggs. Granny believes that Bugs Bunny would be a good substitute, so he goes to the Warner Brothers Studio where Bugs is filming 3-minute segments to complete his cartoons. Here you must sit through the various recordings and projections of Looney Tunes Cartoon segments to try to talk with Bugs.The new animation is quite poor and Mel's vocal work is weak (well, it's older). It's hard to tell that this poor material was produced and directed by veterans Looney Toonists FRIZ FRELENG & BOB McKIMSON.Oh, and since this was for the children, all of Elmer Fudd's shots have been removed from the television special.

Used cartoon clips from: 1) Knighty Knight Bugs2) Hillbilly Hare3) Bully for Bugs4) Tweety's Circus (Tweety & Sylvester) 5) Birds Anonymous (Tweety & Sylvester) 6) For Scent- Reason Imental (Pepe Le Pew) 7) Rabbit Of Seville8) Foghorn Leghorn cartoon9) Robin Hood Daffy (Daffy & Porky) * almost complete, only the end has been removed to segway back to the new animation. * 10) Sahara Hare. COMPLETE COMPLETE CARTOON: YOUR STORY THAT WILL RAISE THE HARE - basically a cartoon in which Bugs tells his nephew about his various adventures in 8 minutes, this means very short clips.

Bugs Bunny: Hare Extraordinaire (Looney Tunes Super Stars) Lucas Duck: Frustrated Fowl (Looney Tunes Super Stars) On a positive note: June Foray gets credit on screen for expressing Granny, something that is usually overlooked in voice credits (but we knew it was her).""",0
"b'It is not very challenging! I bought this video when I started training but I never did. Later I started doing many videos of Denise Austin, including her yoga workouts.

"b'For those of you who have read the wonderful novel on which this film was based, the only advice I can give you is to not see it. I could not even force myself to watch the whole movie, I turned it off in the middle of the session. The acting is not really up to scratch, the ""bad boy"" seems as threatening as a wet kitten, and the worst of all is that the only thing the movie shares in common with the book are the names of the characters, and that that\'s it. Hollywood massacred the novel in every way in form and form. I have not been so disappointed with a book turned into a movie since the Eragon movie came out. For those of you who have not read the book, this could be a decent movie, although seriously corny (do you work in a chocolate shop?

"b""Jerry Lewis is Jerome Littlefield, an assistant in a mental institution who acts crazier than patients. Since Frank Tashlin directed this film, Jerry is free to concentrate solely on his performance, which he does perfectly. Once again, Jerry is the lovable loser, who was expelled from medical school because he felt the symptoms of every patient he diagnosed. This film presents a lot of excellent visual gags. Jerry arranges a television in the room of a patient who has a bad reception, also known as snow. When you pull out the front of the TV, the snow blows off the stage and soon fills the room! A patient has a full-body cast from head to toe, which looks like a cast mummy. Jerry accidentally hits him, the patient rolls down a hill and hits a tree. There are pieces of broken plaster everywhere, but there is no body! Jerry declares, & quot; I lost a patient! & quot; The film concludes with one of the craziest chase scenes in film history, when a stretcher with wheels and an injured man leaves the back of an ambulance and continues rolling down the hills, while the first and then two ambulances they're chasing him. This movie features more LPM (laughs per minute) than most modern comedies, and is one of Jerry's funniest movies.""",1

Unfortunately, this version is designed for television, and twenty-five minutes shorter than my original VHS version.

"b""Synopsis: John Ritter plays Roy Knable, a real couch potato whose life and marriage disintegrate around his ears as he watches television escape everything. The same night that his wife Helen (Pam Dawber) tries to leave him, a mysterious salesman named Spike (Jeffrey Jones) seems to sell Roy a new television set, complete with a gigantic satellite dish that will transmit 666 channels to Roy's living room . However, something goes wrong when Roy and his wife are absorbed by the satellite dish and enter the infernal world of Satan TV. From there, it's a frantic hurry to survive before time runs out. About the movie: Stay Tuned is probably one of my favorite comedy movies. The first time I saw it was in the early 90's and when I saw it had been released on DVD, I took the opportunity to get it. Stay Tuned is full of slapstick humor, a large number of very twisted comedies about classic television clich\xc3\xa9s and eacute; s and TV programs. Among them are Saturday Night Live, Star Trek, The Next Generation, Three's Company, WWF and classic cartoons. The cartoon is presented in a wonderfully charming animated sequence that was actually supervised in production by the legendary animator Chuck Jones (who did many of the cartoons of Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck). This is really the top of the movies starring John Ritter. Ritter's comic time helps make this movie. While this film never received much attention, it is undoubtedly an excellent example of why John Ritter's comedy career spanned more than 2 decades. It was very good as it did. Veteran comedian Eugene Levy (`` SCTV '' and `` American Pie '') also plays an important role in this film as Crowley, a Hell TV Exec that helps the Knables on their journey. He manages to play the adorable slimeball quite entertaining. Jeffrey Jones plays the bad guy, the Hell TV CEO, Spike. He is a great actor for the bad guy in a comedy, and he manages to be convincingly evil and funny at the same time without making the role look stupid, as the bad guys often do in slapstick comedies these days. With John Ritter's comic timing and Pam Dawber playing the heterosexual man as they fall from the insane channel to the insane channel, this movie is great for a lot of laughs. About the DVD: Stay Tuned comes in a cardboard DVD case, marking it as a cheap rate. It is presented in widescreen format with Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. Both the image and the sound are quite good. I did not notice any problems with either of them. The DVD has been translated into French (why not in Spanish?) And has subtitles in English, French and Spanish. For special features, the DVD comes with an extended theatrical trailer, information about the cast and a behind-the-scenes look of the film. The cast information is simply a list of actors in the film. They do not even provide biographies, so this is a clear case of increasing the content with minimal effort. The featurette is the kind they used to show on television right before the movie came out, with interviews with the cast that are completely enlightening if you've seen the movie. It's only slightly interesting. The downside is that the music played behind the commentator is downright annoying during the first quarter. This DVD release is a fairly simple standard release. In general, a great movie in a little exciting DVD release. 4 stars""",1

"b'If I have not said this before I\'ll say it again, I\'m a huge fan of George A. Romero\'s Night Of The Living Dead and its sequels that he\'s done over the past forty years. Thanks to him, we know the horrible world of Zombies and the Undead in great detail and we know in what terrifying place you can be trapped, be it an old farm, a suburban shopping center, an underground bunker or any place that leaves you open an attack of the heaters of the living. Of course, once you create such a popular character in Horror, you get an imitation scam trying to capitalize on your original creation. Oddly enough, most of these types of films have had varying degrees of success, especially the Italian Zombie filmmakers of the eighties. Unfortunately, the one that started it all, the 1968 NOTLD, due to a copyright attack, never got that precious right and it soon became clear to everyone that anyone could release it, own it and / or do any version with that. plot and title in any way they choose. But first, a bit of history: in 1998 Anchor Bay and John A. Russo (one of the men to help create the original 68 with Romero) decided to launch a 30th Anniversary version of the classic, but instead of simply returning to publish the same old print as any other DVD company, I film and add new footage with the previous one, creating a new subplot that not only damages the original movie, but betrays the social commentary that was established in The First Place. A real mistake and the fans were not happy. However, when it came to completing remakes, at least someone understood it even before this. In 1990, with the personal guidance of Romero and FX genius Tom Savini at the helm, they made a movie of Night Of The Living Dead that stayed close to the original screenplay, giving the 90\'s audience an update that did not they could only be proud, but better in some aspects of the bloody and production values. So, after a well done remake and a learning error in what should not be done to a classic, could it ever happen again? Apparently not . In 2006, with director Jeff `` Corman Wanna-Be \'\' Broadstreet in the chair, they decided to give it a try again, of course, without the necessary consent of Romero, but this time with a twist: Let\'s try to do in 3D ! 3D? For real ? It sounds like a curious idea, but it really stays flat here. Being frank NOTLD3D is a parody. Filmed with a nonexistent budget, this has to be the worst ""reinvention"" of a movie since 2001 Planet Of The Apes. Sure, most of your favorite characters are here, but this time mixed and played by actors who are so rigid, it\'s hard to distinguish them from real zombies. And the story is so slow and boring that it seems like a 3 o\'clock viewing of something you\'d expect to see on Sci-Fi Channel. In addition, although the gore factor in the original 68 was minimal at best, 36 years later still not much is seen, or nothing, but not for reasons of MPAA but financial, and in fact, halfway I I asked why was this \'\' R \'\' qualified in the first place? The new twists of the plot were unconvincing, the boring sets, and the cameo of the newly crowned Horror icon Sid Haig (which in my opinion is not that big in the first place) is completely unnecessary and only helps in establishing that this was what last in cash -ins of movies. So your main attraction has to be your 3D, right? Incorrect . Instead of using the latest stereoscopic 3D technology (which has the ""shades of gray""), they used the old-fashioned anaglyphic type (red / blue) which in turn turns the whole film into a mess of purple tones. And do not expect anything to ""jump"" you. When it works, and it\'s weird, it only provides depth of background, which means that it makes the image look deeper, not closer. It should also be borne in mind that, apart from the behind-the-scenes features, this whole album is in 3D, which means that without the glasses, it is impossible to see. There is no 2D version on the disc included as it should have been (that version is released separately), so once those glasses go, it\'s the best roller coaster. In short, bad movie, bad 3D, bad idea. It was remade in 1990, and eight years later it received a trick that did not work either. Even as a movie alone, a scam like Day Of The Dead 2: Contagium is a better movie. Difficult to suggest, even if you are a completista like me, NOTLD3D is a dead movie that should have been buried.

"b'First, I recommend the review below, by the guy called `` Patillas. ""I think it captures the factual basis and spirit of this film, I can understand how some who are` `Australia-philes \'\' may want to see a purely Australian product, and that\'s not all. \'\' It\'s not` `Smash Palace \'\' or Many other Australian fine films of that genre, what this film is, can be described in one word: WEIRD, that\'s a good thing, the genius of Eric Roberts used to be (and may be again) his ability to seemingly get lost in his roles, and doing so while lacking in self-awareness about how you are in. Watching this movie and then seeing other excellent (and strange) films, such as `` The Pope of Greenwich Village \'\' and `` Runaway Train \'\', is to see an arch of career that was quite surprising, seemed to get into serious movies with great talent around him, and then be able to carry out demanding roles (although, some similar, sure), with energy and command.Well, in this film. nothing, let\'s be honest, est a is not a deep movie. It should not be . It\'s almost like an independent version of a Farrely brothers movie, at least the first ones, where they do not mind taking risks and also having fun. There is also a nice romantic subtext that they had (`` Kingpin \'\' - believe it or not, `` Me, Myself & Irene \'\') where, in a ridiculous way, they reflect what a good majority of people looking for love or simply they look for something in themselves, and find it reflected or, in the case of the main characters of Farrely\'s films, and definitely in ""Coca Cola Kid"", booed by others. I\'m not saying that Woody Harrelson or Jim Carrey could have been the Coca Cola Kid, but what they all have in common, in the specific roles they played in these films, is to make us ask if anyone could find something remotely. interesting about them in a romantic way. They are completely unlinked, it seems almost cartoonish, and then you just think of a lot of people we all know, and it\'s not that amazing. The music in the movie is just fantastic. The Coca Cola jingle The commissions of the characters of Robert are incredible, and are marked by this aborigine guy who is playing with his device, a guy that Roberts finds outside the local offices of Coca Cola and that immediately enters into service. It\'s really fun to see how The Kid\'s mind works: the marketing wheels begin to think and employ their strategies. Everyone on both sides are equally mocked, and that makes for a really fine movie, mostly without prejudice (rare these days, huh?). There are other nice touches on the soundtrack and, besides, I would be remiss, not to mention NUTS, if I avoided the very nice scene of Greta Scaatchi where she is cooling ... well, go see the movie! It is peculiar, it is revealing and very funny. It also does a great job of discussing cultural clashes, where, when all are harmless, you can see how progress arises from a certain dissension, and yet we wonder if we are losing something in translation.

"b""It would be difficult to formulate a coherent film composed of the disparate elements that the director and others obviously felt compelled to include within this scenario, but a worthy attempt is made, which collapses after the first half. A pre-Columbian ceremonial disc, gold and jeweled, has been divided, and while half is displayed in a permanent collection of the museum of the city of New York, the other segment has become the subject of a search expedition to an Andean region , under the aegis of American archaeologist Brooks Willings (David Keith), who is obsessed with achieving his recovery. His wife and daughter remained in New York, but when young Diana (Camilla Belle) became a disciplinary problem at their school, they join Brooks in the Andean town where his expedition is, hoping his wife will correct the anguish of Diana's behavior. , just to be overwhelmed by additional problems that originate in your new situation. Continuity fails at this point when Diana becomes entangled in the mystic rites of the town, Brooks and his wife (skillfully played by Nancy Allen) fall into serious marital discord, a Catholic priest, portrayed with humor by John Rhys-Davies is tormented by the local cultists, the expedition has developed a shortage of personnel and funding, and others, too many threads to interweave in a consummate plot. To solve its great self-imposed conundra, the work becomes a silly fantasy, including silly special effects, as an easy resolution. Keith is wooden, manifestly uninspired by his role, but Belle is effective and the Rhys-Davies moment is worthy of study, while the laurels act for the magnificent oriental Indian Roshan Seth, who easily dominates each of his scenes in the part of a shaman with extraordinary wisdom and magical powers. Filmed in the picturesque province of Salta, in northern Argentina, the image benefits from both M\xc3\xa1ximo Munzi's cinematography and Luis Bacalov's faithfully ethnic score; if only one way had been seen to strengthen the stuttering scenario.""",0

""I could see that the bulb went on over his head and he went straight out and saw it again, it goes without saying that he loved the movie, as I did, it is not often that a big star has the guts to make fun of himself just to make your fans laugh, so if you have this movie languishing in your collection somewhere, you need to see it with this in mind, it\'s a parody, satire, comedy, look at it and have fun.'",1

"b""One would think that a movie with a starred cast would have some redeeming qualities but not this one. The characters are flat and do not provide any reason for the audience to feel emotionally attached. The egocentric protagonist of Zeta-Jones is terrible and monotonous, John Cusacks depressed and the lonely character is incredible and impossible to stick to, the press agent of Billy Crystal who tries to please everyone, the character is not funny and the character of Julia Robert seems only to be present because he has a big smile. The highlight, if you can call it that, is the foreign lover character of Hank Azaria. His character is horribly stereotypical, but at least he acts a little when speaking with an accent (even if the accent is exaggerated). Even Christopher Walken, who is good at almost anything, gets lost in this movie. His small role as a movie maker does not even make sense, there is nothing in the movie that gives clues about the ending in which Walken's character plays an important role. The main point of the film is Zeta. The character of Jone and the character of John Cusack are back together. - It is completely lost because they simply do not have amount of chemistry together on the screen. His performance is completely flat. This movie is disappointing even when compared to all the other bad romantic comedies there are. One last note: Doberman's joke could be fun and appropriate for the third grade if it were not for the fact that Crystal's character seems to enjoy being licked in the groin by a dog. He even tells the dog where to lick. That's not funny, it's just disturbing.""",0

"b'After buying all available copies of this film in the market, please take my advice: DO NOT OVERLOAD! Obviously there is not a decent impression of this movie currently available. Being that it was originally produced by Samuel Goldwyn and released through United Artists, one could assume that MGM / UA Home Video could contain the original negatives (since they seem to have rights to other Goldwyn movies currently). The truth is that there is no better version of this film, and it would be a shame given its historical importance and the place it occupied in Soviet / American relations at the time it was made. But until MGM Home Video launches this title (IF they ever do it), save your dollars and download it for free from the Internet. The quality can not be worse.'",0

We are entering more and more into the morass of immorality among some inhabitants of the city: Jean does not seem like a very nice girl, but someone has to appear in court for her death, even if it means that the persecution leads to the top. of the Williamsburg Bridge itself.

"b""We should all congratulate Uwe Boll. It's like a kind of cinematic cockroach. No matter how little talent he has, and no matter how bad these films are, he manages to keep doing it. I know, he funds them all through some kind of strange German background, but even so, his ability to continue making films despite total and absolute failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe. It would not be so bad except that video game developers continue to give their best properties to this guy. I really enjoyed the Alone in the Dark series of games. Even the last one, the New Nightmare, was good for a few hours of play. There was a good movie to make of the adventures of Edward Carnby, but this is not all. Now Uwe Boll has in his hands Bloodrayne and Hunter: the Reckoning. What's next, Silent Hill? Doom? I can only imagine the range that this guy is going to cut through game-to-movie adaptations if he does not stop. Someone has to take away your line of credit, or these video game publishers must realize and realize that when they make a bad movie of a game that kills the franchise, no one is interested in that title anymore. Think about it. , is House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark a viable game title? No way . A new game of House of the Dead goes out for XBox and nobody cares about it. The title is dead, and all for Uwe Boll. So, if one of you works for a game editor, or knows a game editor, or has access to a game editor ... please let them know. This movie in itself does not even deserve to be reviewed. I can not separate what I did not like from this pile of manure from the rest. Literally, everything about that sucks. Writing, acting, music, CG effects, editing. I thought that if I waited until it came out on DVD and then I rented it with few expectations, I would not be disappointed. Even the $ 5 you will spend on this DVD if you buy it used at one of the Amazon sellers is too much. You will regret it . This movie is just a bunch of Boll.""",0

"b""Iggy's performance is great, highlighted by 5 Foot One, but what is really cool is listening to her interview with Tom Snyder. His front tooth is rotten and he's a little puzzled after doing Dogfood, but it's a great interview. Hilarious, insightful and intelligent. Igy's interview is a welcome gift after seeing the painful interview with John Lydon, who is the typical John Lydon. Standoffish, horrible yellow teeth rotten, sullen, laconic and difficult. However, there is no PIL music, just an interview. The Plasmatics offered an entertaining show. In a moment, the guitarist crosses the audience and falls completely over a high-ranking gentleman who probably did not realize for what show he had obtained the tickets. Another old woman has her fingers in her ears. Plasmatic flying a car. Wendy O is very sweet and somewhat shy during her interview with Snyder, the antithesis of her character on stage and Reform School Girls (****). The ramon are always good. However, they are not interviewed by Snyder. I was on vacation that week. The 77th Punk Roundtable with Joan Jett, Paul Weller, Graham, etc. It is interesting to listen and see where the music went from there. Kim Fowley (the producer, manager, etc.) seems a complete jacka $, but adds considerable entertainment to the whole discussion. In general, the sound quality on this DVD is not spectacular. The bass is thin, and the vox often eclipses the instruments, but the performances far outweigh this. It is a journey of total nostalgia to see the episodes in their entirity and is often hilarious. It's funny how some of the same issues in today's media (violence in sports, economics, Ricky Schroeder) were the same stories they talked about in the early 80's.""",1
"b""Harvey Pekar's comic, American Splendor pioneered a new genre: the autobiographical comic. At first glance, the day-to-day events of a Cleveland file clerk hardly seem like the material for an interesting movie. Fortunately, filmmakers Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman are able to understand the fun, heartbreaking and fascinating life of Pekar and adapt successfully from the panels of the page to the big screen. Like Ghost World, American Splendor defends outsiders who do not fit with society in general. In a nice touch, comes a mini comic book with the DVD that briefly recounts the experience of Pekar with the adaptation of his comic in a movie. The album features an interesting audio commentary with the real Harvey Pekar, his wife Joyce, his daughter Danielle, his friend Toby Radloff, the filmmakers Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman, and actor Paul Giamatti. Everyone has a lot of fun on this track while they joke and remember the movie and their experiences. `` Road to Splendor '' is a brief update of what Harvey has been doing since the film was made. The song, `` American Splendor '', by Eytan Mirsky, which appeared in the film can be heard in its entirety. His voice sounds mysteriously like Evan Dando of the Lemonheads. Finally, there is a theatrical trailer for the movie. American Splendor has the same ironic sense of humor and melancholy as Ghost World, another excellent film adaptation of an independent comic. American Splendor remains true to the vision of Pekar: refuses to sentimentalize his life, even in the emotional conclusion of the film, which is really moving. It is one of the best adaptations of comics that have been filmed, as it remains faithful to its original material and with wisdom it involves its creator in the process of transferring its story from the page to the screen.""",1
"b'The film is a strange animal, it\'s fine, a work without gender, and sometimes Gordon seems to have surpassed himself, looking for effects that he is not able to achieve. The different styles, moods and genres give the film a somewhat garish, amateurish look, but in the end (perhaps consciously on Gordon\'s part) this clumsiness works in favor of the film. The Singing Detective is a remarkably naive, fresh and daring play, almost childish in its lack of pretension, and easily one of the most original American films of the last twenty years. Above all, it shows the pulp writer afflicted and bitter about the disease of Robert Downey Jr., within whose head the whole film takes place (more or less), and Downey offers an inventive and powerful performance, which may be the apotheosis of his enormous talent Despite praise for Downey, in his release, Gordon\'s film was met with a wall of critical resistance, a true consensus of contempt. This may be due in part (at least in the United Kingdom) to the fondness for the original Potter television series; but perhaps it was more due to the basic incompatibility of Potter\'s idiosyncratic and scathing vision with the main tastes (critics). Whatever the case may be, the movie once again failed tragically to find its audience. As in his previous adaptations, Gordon respected the original material without rebelling, and as a director, has a rare gift: the ability to fuse his own sensitivity and talent. with its theme at a fundamental level. In the case of The Singing Detective, it was a somewhat less perfect fusion; Potter\'s vision (his strange mixture of musical fantasy with somber psychological realism) was so surprisingly original that it required another sensitivity at least as strong and eccentric to merge. Gordon still does not possess (yet) the surrealistic gifts to make Potter\'s vision his own, or take it to the next level (David Lynch could be the only director capable of that). He is a competent director in every way, and seems to be blessed with a natural relationship with the actors (maybe why so many good guys want to work with him). However, Gordon is not a visionary director, and this was a visionary script. Fortunately, he had a visionary actor in his professional heyday to take over, and Downey takes the day. The Singing Detective is not a masterpiece; it is defective and fractured and sometimes thin, even easy and occasionally redundant (especially in pseudo-noir sequences). But it is an imaginative and intrepid piece of cinema, an admirably eccentric work that manages to do something like justice in brilliant writing. Filled with witty delights and touches of heart, it leaves most of the recent movies of Americans in the dust. However, it failed a lot, both in the United Kingdom and in the USA. UU., And it was revised so little that many people (myself included) missed him, suspicious of the stench of failure. It so happened that the bad smells did not come from the film but from critics who were too corrupt and jaded to recognize a work of art when they saw it.

"b'Watching this musical on a stage in New York is a difficult experience to overcome and I went and saw it four times. But seeing it on film is a totally flat experience. It just does not work on the screen for me. Although you have a cast of great talent, the incredible energy and electricity that is screwed on stage are not here. The musical is a primordial story based around the village, full of people living on the edge. As I lived in New York for 30 years, I instantly felt at home with this hidden world that the average person can not imagine. But spending two hours in a movie theater, seeing this story wet and depressing, is a dark experience. The musical numbers seem all forced. The people are not very nice. They are too dramatic and intense for the comfort zone and the reason why the movie broke out, is that Central America probably could not understand why the people in this movie simply did not pay the cursed rent, and they avoided all the drama and problems! This movie went very well in the big cities where there were people who could identify with this story of tragedy and AIDS. But even for someone like me, who is very familiar with this world, which takes place in the Village, where I lived, it is a depressing and depressing experience with very little to feel optimistic. I can not sympathize with junkies and prosthetics or any of the musical numbers were electrified. They should have obtained a new and fresh cast for the film version and opened it more from the dark, always damp world that surrounds this cinematic treatment.'",0
"b'The ""Exorcist"" by William Friedkin is a milestone. The cultural psyche has still faltered since its arrival on the scene more than thirty years ago. It is a masterpiece that will continue to endure long after many horror films of today are forgotten. Actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) seeks the help of Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) after her daughter Regan (Linda Blair) begins to behave strangely. Realizing that something is terribly wrong with the girl, Father Lankester Merrin (Max von Sydow) is summoned to carry out an exorcism with her. Then there is a terrible battle between the forces of good and evil that pushes all involved to their physical and spiritual breakpoints. Words can not convey the power of ""The exorcist."" ""This is a film that relentlessly attacks the senses and does not apologize for doing so. The gender entries that followed him had no choice but to follow his example because without help he redefined what the audience understood as cinematic horror. While Linda Blair deserves a lot of attention for her excellent work, the equally powerful performance of Jason Miller as Father Karras should not be overlooked. It gives the film an important human component that holds it firmly. Without the Karras bow, `` The Exorcist \'\' is just another screaming movie trying to make money by resorting to cheap emotions. Truly innovative, `` The exorcist \'\' is an impressive work that dared to test the limits of cinema. No serious discussion about the great cinema is complete without mentioning it.'",1

"b'This 90-minute DVD of PBS is somewhat misnamed, but it\'s still an entertaining and fine show. The WCTE WCTE station in Cookeville, TN recorded a series of concerts at the `` Hall of the Volcano \'\' at Cumberland Caverns, 333 feet below ground level. The DVD includes fragments of the performances of 10 musicians or bands that are better called ""Americana"". Some are what can best be described as `` bluegrass \'\', including the well-known Ricky Skaggs and the Cherryholmes family group. Singer and songwriter Darrell Scott and Steve Earle\'s son, Justin Townes Earle (both of whom I love) are better classified as ""American"". The young band 18 South mixes country and bluegrass, while Will Hoge is closer to rock than anything else. Based on the age of both their appearance and the song they play, I suppose that, although this DVD is dated in 2011, the JT Earle clip was recorded about four years ago. I could not identify the others. The performances were recorded with a live audience and it is somewhat ordered to see the rocks of the Caverns in the background, but since the musicians are so well reproduced, I\'m not sure what makes the sound better or different. There are no real introductions; the performer is identified by a title on the screen. So there is no padding here. I enjoyed seeing artists that I know and love (if you have not seen the whitest Black Gospel singer in history, Mike Farris, this is your chance!) But I also discovered some new ones.

"b'First of all, I want to inform you that I am a great recreational fan. So this comes from the perspective of a fanatic. Do you really want to know what this is? This is like the DVD ""Miracle On Third Street"", where the real stories are kept together. There are 4 real stories (3 episodes of TV already seen) and only one new episode of 13 minutes. It begins when TJ and his gang return to the old abandoned yard at the back of the playground and are captured by the kindergarten children. They are held as ""hostages"" by the new boss called Chief Stinky and the gang tries to tell them stories about their experiences with the kindergarteners and then Gus tells them when the gang were kindergarten children (the new episode). The three episodes already seen are `` The Legend of Big Kid \'\', `` Wild Child \'\', and `` The Kindergarten Derby. \'\' Bonus DVD episodes titled \'\' Fans\' 3 Favorite Episodes\' \'are: The Challenge, The Story of Whomps, and One Stayed Clean. * I doubt they are the most favorite because I know that `` The Experiment \'\' is very popular among fans because it is when TJ and Spinelli kiss for the first time. Also if you wonder why Gus is on the cover when he allegedly entered Third Street in 4th grade. Well, on the DVD, Gus went to Third Street during Kindergarten but only for a couple of weeks and only he remembers kindergarten while the rest of the gang does not remember anything about that year which explains why Gus is on the cover. I\'ll notice that the voices of TJ and Mikey are different (not too different or annoying, but it\'s notorious) because the original voices of the voice actors had become too deep. Anyway, when I bought this DVD, I thought it would be an hour-long adventure when TJ and the gang were kindergarteners ... but unfortunately that was not the case. It was really pathetic for Disney to do that and give a sloppy patch of episodes `` already seen on TV. \'\' I gave him only 2 stars for the new episode. If you bought `` Miracle on Third Street \'\' and you were disappointed, I do not think you want this. If you are a new fan and you have not seen all the episodes ... then this is a great DVD for you to catch up! If you are a parent and consider this as a simple whimsical entertainment for your child, I would HIGHLY suggest it, but more so because the DVD and the episodes are hilarious, but they can also have good and affectionate messages of friendship and belief in oneself, and so on I know that most children like this because my younger cousins \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b(between 8 and 12 years old) also like caricature and can relate to the characters when they are in school.

"b""The stories of Dumas have been filmed so often, however, it is still a pleasure to watch them. This new version of the Count of Monte Cristo is no exception. It has serious flaws and errors, too numerous to list. For example: modern language lines, totally incredible interpretations (as other critics mentioned), very amateur characterizations (the Count twirls his locks and his old love recognizes him by the gesture instead of by its almost unaltered appearance). None of these things really upset me. I sat and enjoyed. The opening scene created a mood and photography in general showed fine adjustments. The ending was incredibly cheesy, but since I just saw a wonderful fight / fencing scene with a lush green environment, I did not care too much. A strong complaint that I have about most new movies: the voices are almost inaudible compared to the background of music and noise. I hope you read the book, if you have not done it yet. No film has made the story of Dumas telling the power to justice. The film version of The Three Musketeers with Michael York as D'Artagnan was close. If you are willing to entertain yourself, this movie can adapt to your mood. I already saw it three times.""",1

"b""Robocop 2 is probably the most underestimated and most harshly criticized sequel in history (tying with Predator 2, which came out the same year).

Do not get confused. of a good movie though. Robocop 2 still has the same wild sense of humor, cynical social commentary and pathos character of the first film. It is a hyperrealistic vision of an America populated by gun-loving psychopaths, a democracy owned by big business and addicted to poverty addicted to drugs offered by street vendors who believe they are the second coming of Christ. be the typical way to describe it.

I read Miller's original script when I was in high school and it's quite different and, dare I say, you can not film. Robocop 2 himself was not Nuke Lord Caine, the psychotic hippie with Godhood delusions. His name was Kong, a psychotic policeman who practically killed everyone he crossed. Sgt. Reed and the old man died and there was not much humor. The screenwriter Walon Green was hired to brown the script and much of what appears on the screen is actually his work. The original ideas of Frank Miller were left practically as the framework for the whole film and part of its history was recycled in Robocop 3 (do not blame him for that either). Miller obviously was upset with this, but it was still a good enough sport to appear in the movie (watch him playing Doctor Frank), although he swore never to work in Hollywood again for fear of being taken advantage of. Until Robert Rodriguez promised to fulfill his graphic novel of Sin City. It is possible that Irhoven is gone, but Irvin Kershner strives to offer the same mixture of joy and magic, and actually does it well. The melancholic score of Basil Poledouris is also gone (he returns in Robocop 3) but the new composer Leonard Rosenman creates a wonderfully heroic and optimistic theme that adapts more to the film than the temperamental and tormented Poledouris score to the first. Filmed once again in Texas, Houston this time, you really have to feel for Peter Weller walking in that Robosuit. It must have weighed a ton and it would be sweating inside loads of cubes. There is a particular scene in the movie where Murphy is tortured to death / destruction which is very hard to see. But that leads him to get a completely new makeover and those crazy new directives got in his head. The part where he teaches the children of the Little League and scolds young people who play by the fire hydrant with leaks (after citing some very suspicious philosophy) is funny. Robocop 2 is a great movie. Despite the problems with the script and the history and some slightly outdated stop-motion effects, it's a brilliant sequel that lives up to expectations. Listen to those who do not say. I do not know what kind of movie they expected. And thanks for not smoking! The DVD is wide screen anamorphic 1.85: 1 with dazzling colors (look at the chrome of the armor of Robo) and Dolby 5.1 sound. I'm a little sad that there are no extras, like a comment, because I really would have liked to hear what Kershner has to say about the movie. And there are deleted scenes that I know make Murphy visit his grave and some more details about why Caine is so weird. All right. One can only hope for that in the future ...""",1
b'Do not be seduced by the first two reviews that Amazon has published on this page. This DVD is the authorized release and the quality is fantastic.',1
"b'This 30th anniversary edition features the original movie Night of the Living Dead and offers a new soundtrack and new scenes. As far as I\'m concerned, the original film was perfect and it was not necessary, however, I decided to have an open mind and give this edition a try, considering that the new material was written by John Russo (who co-wrote the original film), and has a photograph (and performance) of Hinzman (who also helped create the original). I was completely disappointed. The new scenes include a new presentation, miscellaneous scenes of zombies marching and being killed by southern peasants, and a new epilogue. The miscellaneous scenes sometimes interfere with the flow of the film, the makeup is less effective and some of the new extras are terrible. They do a decent job of editing in the new scenes, but they are still noticeable (for example, fashions are not entirely correct). The new introduction and the epilogue are ridiculous. The introduction simply states that the main zombie (played by Hinzman) was a criminal when he was alive. This moves away from one of the most effective elements of the film: that the zombies could be their neighbor next door or a friend or close relative, but they will try to kill him without thinking. Hinzman is obviously older in the frontal shots (the profiles are fine). When he starts attacking two gravediggers, one of the ""actors"" begins to flee, then realizes that Hinzman was supposed to grab him first, so he actually goes back to the coffin and bends so that Hinzman can grab him! ! ! The fact that they did not take a second shot shows a lack of attention. The epilogue is a ""one year later"" interview with an insane preacher of the fire of hell and brimstone who survived the carnage. It is stuck in the middle (spoiler warning) of the scene of the death of Duane Jones and the final credits that show the rednecks that get rid of their body. ! Talk about interfering with a very effective ending! You have the option to see the original cut (in an excellent impression), but you can only see it with the new soundtrack! The old soundtrack was composed of music from the library, but it worked excellently. In the best of cases, the new soundtrack is mediocre. Sometimes it does not even adjust to the atmosphere of the scene, for example, being frantic when the action is more calm and depressing. The booklet contains interviews mostly consisting of actors who talk about how ""no flaws"" the new scenes were added and how many fans will love the new version (bad). There is a funny comment track, but you get the same people (plus others, including Romero) giving the same information on the comment tracks in the very superior Elite Millennium Edition.'",0
"b""I so badly wanted to enjoy this movie. I hoped that somehow I would 'pick up' and stand up. Unfortunately he never did, and in fact only gave way to a strange nothing somewhere in the middle. Basically, it's a cynical paranormal writer who stays in a hotel room where all kinds of bad things happened over the years. And really? That is all. However, there was a lot to work on in the story. It could have been deeper, the plot more involved. The characters could have been much more than they were. This movie is a jumble of nebulous loose ends that are never tied. It moves at a snail's pace and you wait for something that never happens. The ending is incredible and artificial. However, the special effects are very good.""",0
"b""This movie is a TOTAL JOKE! When looking at the poster, I would think that it is full of action and dazzling like `` Underworld '' or `` Resident Evil ''. DO NOT! ! The actors were super slow with the fight scenes (as if they were practicing) and the dialogues were stupid. Waste of talent for Ben Kingsley (who is always good as we all know). You can not tell if the configuration is in England or the USA. UU Because the actors can not decide with their accents. Loss of my money and time ..""",0

"b'I was very disappointed with how far this film deviates from the real story! He is ""approximately"" Prince Caspian, but he lacks many important elements. Number one, they left Aslan almost in its entirety until the end. Those who are familiar with the book will remember that Aslan is the most important part of the strength and development of the story. It was he who called the children to Narnia for his purpose a plan. Half of the book is about Aslan and the children, so the fact that they have left their importance outside of the movie really ruins the story. Not Aslan, not Narnia! There are a number of other aspects that do not fit the book, but some of these could be more easily overlooked if they had not deviated from the true ""Heart"" of the story. The other big disappointment for me was how he altered the character of Peter. His whole attitude changed. You never have the chance to warm up to him and, in the end, he\'s almost glad he does not return to Narnia. (The same can be said of Susan.) The storyline seemed very weak, and the relationship that Caspian and Susan tried to create was totally unnecessary and I felt it helped a lot to ruin the movie as well. But if you are not interested in the fidelity of the story, the ""Prince Caspian"" by Andrew Adamson is an action-packed adventure with many wonderful visual and special effects. However, I recommend that you read the story. The book has much more wealth and purpose. I wish they had stayed true to this story, just as they had the `` The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. \'\' I hope you do better in `` The Voyage of the Dawn Treader \'\'. We will see ... ! These are just some of my thoughts. Needless to say, I feel that they could have made this movie so much better.'",0
"b""First I saw Stallone's version of this movie. I must say that I did not hate him and I liked the music and the girl who played his breath. But then I searched and found the original with Michael Caine. This movie is far superior to the movie that 'Rocky' did. This has become my personal favorite and I think one of the best performances of Michael Caines. It definitely stays even today. He's violent, he does not apologize and it's just a damn revenge movie.""",1
"b'Great movie . . . good actors. . . I love the European atmosphere of the film and Matt Damon seems really sexy.

They are too different.'",1
"b'I will not even go into the story or the roles of the actors. I want ... I have to tell everyone about the transfer to the DVD of this classic movie. The image looks like a bad VHS copy made by an amatuer! The sound ... My God, the sound is absolutely horrible! I saw it on my 36-inch Sony TV and immediately cleaned my DVD player thinking there was something wrong with that. I adjusted the sound on my Sony ES (Professional Grade) Reciever several times and in various modes, from Mono to Theater EX and basic stereo, and nothing would improve it. MGM is ashamed! !

"b'This documentary is complete BS. The facts and opinions are totally incorrect. I doubt whoever is responsible for this has even read a single book in Gettysburg. Heth\'s troops opened the battle, not Early. Little Roundtop was the most important battle feature on the second day, not on Culp Hill. Custer did not `` Save the Union. \'\' In fact, Grant\'s victory at Vicksburg did more to end the Civil War than the Battle of Gettysburg. If Meade had lost there, he would have retreated to Washington\'s impenetrable defenses and waited for Grant\'s army to move Lee away from the district. I have read in many books about Gettysburg that Lincoln was furious that Meade did not follow the battle. chasing Lee. His statements about a ""discovery"" of a handwritten telegram about this and subsequent opinions was absurd. In fact, these four ""facts"" are only the beginning. Even the material related to the direction was silly. Avoid this garbage.'",0
"b""This is one of those rare movies that completely captures teenagers in a fun and honest way. Enid and Rebecca are two misfits who have just graduated from high school. While Rebecca gets a job trying to get her own apartment and move into adulthood, Enid is still struggling to try to find her place in a new world. This is obvious from his reluctance to get a job and move on. After making a joke to an older and lonely man, somehow ends up becoming his friend while separating from Rebecca. Enid is a character with whom sometimes you get angry, but at the same time you understand that you are having trouble moving forward in life and feeling empathy for. He is very talented but has no idea what exactly he wants to do. So he resorts to the marginalized, like the crazy old man waiting for a bus that never arrives and old Seymour. This movie is often sad but also fun. You always wonder where this movie will take you. Even the end is the perfect touch, although some do not like it. It's a great movie that is really real and honest. These are not characters from cardboard cutouts, these are real girls. In conclusion, all the rumor deserves. You will like this if you enjoy intelligent and independent films that are not invented and that actually have some real meaning. Sparkly!""",1

I even had my boyfriend to try one day and he was sweating like crazy and said that his abs had never been so painful. I love this DVD! I have not had the opportunity to watch the 3-mile DVD that goes with it, but I'm sure it's just as cool. Sometimes Leslie gets a little excited talking and interacting with Jimmy.

Very soon, maybe we all use numbers so the government can track it! !

Tom Cruise is a good actor and the others were good too, but moral questioning is the movie. I like it .'",1

"b'Interview with a vampire was an excellent movie, made wonderfully based on an incredible idea. Queen Of The Damned illustrates, though nothing else, that Anne Rice is a wonderfully creative writer, but I discovered that this film version of one of her books was very boring with many fine characters like wafers. The vampire Lestat (wonderfully played by Stuart Townsend) decides to leave retirement, which in fact is a dream of several hundred years. He gives a great idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bthe world of vampires; you know that he hates light, garlic and all the holy things; loves the darkness, attractive blood, young lady necks and eerrr `` Nu-Metal! ""But what bothers him most is that he is immortal."" I mean he does not age at all, he seems to have unlimited financial resources, however, he is so bored with life. It sounds like a kind of spoiled, spoiled vampire to me! So he realizes that if he can provoke all the other vampires, maybe they will be so enraged that they will get him out of this eternal misery, and who better for the job than the `` Queen of the Damned \'\' - or Aaliyah for us . How do you provoke them and her? Well, he becomes the lead singer of the biggest and most controversial Nu-Metal band in the world. Hi, I would definitely be with all the other vampires. There are interesting aspects to this movie: how he became a vampire and how he dealt with this is quite fascinating. In addition, it is all fused with typical Gothic colors and images. The monologue of his thoughts is full of comical irony and is presented in a wonderful form of \'dead story\'. Some of the subtle interactions between the characters are also hilarious. Aaliyah looks amazing in her role as the queen of all vampires; she really has a presence on the screen and what a tragedy that her career as an actress and musician was interrupted. The conflicts between vampires and vampires that go through the film are also quite original. Unfortunately, none of the effects is particularly spectacular. In general, although the idea is good, the development and the story are too weak for this to be a truly memorable film.'",0
"b'This is a horror movie from the 70s based on the successful book of the ""true"" story of a haunted house on Long Island. It was unmasked and proved to be a total farce, but the film resulted in a dozen sequels and even needed that the Lutz remake.The family buys their dream home only to find that it is frequented, and also kindly contains the passage to hell in the basement Yes, it is completely overwhelming to think that if that passage existed in something called Hell, it would be in Amityville, Long Island. James Brolin plays the husband, a tough guy with a lot of hair. Margot Kidder is the wife, who reacts with large, open eyes every time she witnesses a ghost, hallucination, atrocity, etc. Most scares are doors that open or something, looking at something, and then the music gets very loud, and then we see people\'s eyes, closer, and then, da-da! A special cheesy effect. Good for the value of nostalgia. The appearance of Rod Steiger as a crazed priest is a great advantage. Like a cheap exorcist. If these kinds of movies scare you, it may be worth it in a slow night. Good for some involuntary laughter, too.'",0

"b""The war against humanity is at its highest point. The planet Roku San is at its hardest point. With military support dwindling, soldiers dying daily and with new insects constantly being revealed to the world, how will humanity survive, if it were not you? The Federation is currently looking for men and women to help fight this terror. How would you like to be a hero and how would you like to become a citizen while you do it? Would you like to know more ? STARSHOOP TROOPERS as a series has become famous, if only because the second movie did not contribute anything to the story of the first film. With little hope in mind, I started looking at STARSHOOP TROOPERS: MARAUDER with the hope that, somehow, it would be better than the second, and maybe as good as the first. Suddenly, disillusionment takes the reins and returns me one step with STARSHIP TROOPERS 3. Located on the planet Roku San and following our original hero, Johnny Rico, it soon shows that the movie has little hope when we know some of his characters. Johnny Rico, experienced in his newfound years in the military, has always been known not to follow orders, but in the case of death? Marshal of Heaven, one of the most famous men on Earth, is he a pop star? And soldiers who would not normally be impressed by the star are in love with the presence of a field marshal singer, often to the point of completely disobeying orders and ignoring the outside threat. What does the series have, too, if it's not a total cheese factor? Unfortunately, this does not go away soon. With a plot that follows mainly a carefree actress, called Angelina Jolie, called Jolene Blalock while leading a small group of people in the desert of Roku San, the film finally goes down as it becomes an exaggerated attempt of a science film fiction. PROS: - Some actors. Jolene Blalock played her character very well, as did Marnette Patterson as Holly Little. I also have to give credit to the man who played Johnny Rico for his contribution to this film. I do not know how much they paid him, but with the hope of justifying his time by playing in a very bad and very underdeveloped movie. The long list of cons: CONS: The CGI. Since the first film was made in 1997, it was incredibly disappointing that the CGI was so bad. Given the advancement in computer graphics technology, one would think that a movie would at least TRY to meet standards like its 1997 counterpart. No, it did not. There is no need to think more. The acting. Most of the action was full of poor actors and actresses. Over emphasized, without emphasis, without emphasis at all, I found very few actors worth watching. I could not help being ashamed of the way some of them played their characters, and the way several of them were portrayed. Military men and women do not follow what we, as individuals, would think they would do, marshals and officers order the troops in senseless and senseless patterns, and the soldiers throw themselves on explosive insects when they can simply retreat to the back of the room . Courage is not even a problem here, its stupidity takes the toll. The cheese. Yes, I specifically mentioned cheese, if only because it is very relevant in this film. Sky Marshals as pop stars, the soldiers tell them that they will shoot them if they ask for an autograph, then they try to ask for an autograph, high-ranking Federation officials do not bother to draw a gun when they are beaten mercilessly, and then they try to Arrest a soldier for having taken him out of the assailant, there is not a cheesy amount of action in this movie, since there is no shortage of stupidity that comes with the cheese factor. In general, I could not help it. I wonder what exactly happened with this movie. STARSHIP TROOPERS 2 was a disappointment in itself, but three? ... it is awful . It's better than 2, if only because it follows the history and world construction of the first best, but it still does not make it a movie worth seeing. The STARSHIP TROOPERS franchise should have died after the first one was made. . MARAUDER should quickly die a slow and horrible death, if only because it tarnishes the original to the point of disappointment. I was excited to see this, despite the warnings that several of my friends gave me. I definitely will not see a room in this movie. If I start trying, I'll remind myself how horrible two and three were, and then I'll insert the first movie in the DVD player, if only because the first will always be the only good STARSHIP TROOPERS movie.""",0
"b""This movie could have been much better, but they just had to ruin it, right? With the exception of the very good performances of Denzel Washington, Ed O'Neill and Queen Latifah, the rest of the movie just falls apart. The plot seems so ridiculous that I can not avoid looking the other way. Angelina Jolie's performance is below average, but she did everything possible. The final turn was not very disappointing, but it did come down due to his exaggerated (or lack of) suspense. I really did not like watching this thriller. There are better ones like Se7en and The Usual Suspects. Look at those two, and you'll see what a real thriller should look like. Grade: D +""",0
"b""I loved this movie when I was a kid, so I thought I would buy the DVD. I saw a criticism about the quality of the image being very bad but I went ahead and bought it anyway.

Basically it looks like they punctured this copy of a mutilated 16mm projector. The print has a bad cog effect that causes the image to shake on the screen. It seems that they used the bulb of an easy cooking oven to project this impression. Calling the muddy image would be a compliment. All life and color have been absorbed by this movie. I mentioned that the movie was not even focused. The sound was also pretty bad, but I'm not very audiophile to really talk about that. Do yourself a favor and look for the VHS version.

"b'Coleman Silk (Anthony Hopkins) is a highly respected dean and university professor. After an innocent comment is misinterpreted as a racist comment, he is forced to give up his work in disgrace. Coleman begins a strange adventure with a woman without direction (Nicole Kidman) of half her age, who has had a tragic past and is not ready to return his love. For me, this strange little film was doomed from the beginning, when the great finish is shown immediately. The rest of the story is shown in choppy and anticlimactic flashbacks (often out of order) that did not allow any buildup of tension or sympathy for the main character, Coleman. As a young man from New Jersey, he is played by Wentworth Miller, who is quite charismatic and pleasant, but he looked and looked nothing like the adult Welsh Coleman (who sometimes seemed to channel Hannibal Lector). Hopkins is so terribly wrong in this role that it is impossible to buy the racially charged plot. Kidman was also completely wrong in this movie; Her innate grace and elegance could not be hidden by a messy hairstyle and I never bought her as an illiterate custodian. His graphic love scenes with Hopkins were more spooky than romantic. There is so much personal tragedy among the main characters, including Gary Sinise who plays a writer with problems and Ed Harris as a Vietnam veteran, and yet the film fails completely and I did not feel anything connected with them or the whole premise of injustice. Afterwards, I kept shaking my head at this amazing disaster of a movie and I was amazed that so much talent could not save it.'",0
"b'& quot; Coffy & quot; (1973) made Pam Grier a star, & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; (1974) clearly shows why Grier became a star. & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; simply distills the star qualities of Grier and uses them to their full potential, and stellar qualities, I do not mean just his broad chest. In & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; Grier is a crazy mistreated and raped in search of revenge at all costs, not only chews the landscape, but erases it. But that\'s exactly why we love Grier. She is beautiful, sensual and can kick an ass completely! As far as I\'m concerned, she\'s the original action heroine on the screen and this vehicle best shows her talent as an action star. Unlike & quot; Coffy, & quot; & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; does not give Grier much opportunity to flex his acting muscles, but presents Grier down and dirty: Foxy loots apartments, hits hostile lesbians, hits eyes, burns living men, emasculates (literally and figuratively) and even pulls out guns of your perfectly groomed afro & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; It is creepy, tremendously sadistic, absolutely exaggerated and a classic cult movie for those same reasons. & quot; Coffy & quot; It may be the best movie, but & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; It\'s nicer. So, how? Foxy Brown & quot; rate on DVD? Well, the album is an absolute revelation. Since the theatrical debut of the movie it did not look so good. The previous full-frame transfer used for the video cassette and the laser disk was atrocious, with yellowish skin tones, excessively saturated colors, dark turbid interiors, ruined compositions and horribly oversized edges. The new anamorphically enhanced widescreen transfer is bright. The compositions are properly preserved with an aspect ratio of 1.85: 1, there is no more distracting free space and a bit of image information is added to the sides. The interiors now reveal wood panels, earth tone wallpaper and brown curtains, unlike the previous transfer that represents almost all black or dark brown. The skin tones are finally natural and the colors of the film are reduced to a level of saturation understandable, but do not worry, the fashions of the 70s are still a brilliant kaleidoscope of mud. The sharpness is pleasant; the edge enhancement never raises its ugly head and the skies of the film are finally blue. It was sunlight and yellow sunlight. The film grain is noticed in some dark scenes and there are some defects of origin. Considering that this is a low budget exploitation film made in 1974, the source element is almost pristine. The compression on the disk is not as pristine, however. Some dark, shadowy and dissolved areas are often subject to mosaic artifacts, but at a retail price of only $ 14.95, who can file a complaint? Supplements include the fun theatrical trailer (""Foxy has guts: there\'s nothing, ands or buts!"") And an illuminating comment track by director Jack Hill who repeatedly describes the work of working with AIP (American International Pictures) in this movie, which according to him was one of his worst cinematic experiences. The monaural sound on the disc is commendable; the dialogue is always intelligible and the bass level makes the Willie Hutch score sound as funky as it was 27 years ago. Jack Hill created Pam Grier his own subgenre with & quot; Coffy & quot; and & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; and when she left it after ""gloomy"" & quot; Friday Foster, & quot; nobody took his place ... no one could do it. & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; is the ultimate Pam Grier action vehicle, a blaxploitation classic and a great DVD!

"b""I've been a small-time follower of Smallville, and every year there are always fans (including myself) who mark the current year as `` Jumping the shark ''. If you explore my profile, you will find that my reviews of previous seasons begin with enthusiasm and become more critical as the years go by. While I will not comment on season 8 that is currently broadcasting, the trend seems to be true when comparing season 7 with the previous six: they are pure geniuses compared to this disaster. There are too many things at stake. this year. Smallville always has great comic book stories, but lacks development and internal logic within its own world. Writers jump from plot to plot without rhythm, so you get seemingly dramatic events that change lives and that are completely forgotten in the next episode. There is a surprising twist that involves the new Daily Planet Editor, which does not work well when it becomes interesting; the return of Clark's biological mother, Lara barely lasts one episode; Bizzaro appears and is quickly defeated - twice; Clark travels through time and space to save his baby in Krypton in five minutes. Sam Jones finally returns as Pete Ross and is wasted in a horrible product placement. Supergirl shows up and barely develops before she carries the clich\xc3\xa9 of amnesia and disappears for most of the season. Why not settle for 2 or 3 stories and develop them properly? And do not blame the writer's strike, which cuts this season in 2 episodes, the problems were obvious before the strike occurred. Speaking of external influences, a good number of characters leave the program this year. The sudden departure of Kristen Kreuk to film Street Fighter leaves her already weak character a somewhat anemic farewell, fortunately she will return briefly in season 8 to tie loose ends. Another character that I will not spoil dies a noble death, and will be missed. However, Rosenbaum's departure is the true kicker. Not only does Smallville's best actor not come back, but he was left with an ambiguous and unsatisfactory ending. Hardly 7 years of incredible work. There are some things that Smallville does well this year: the return of Brainiac and the story of 'Veritas' bring a sense of continuity that the program has been regrettably absent. But, in general, there is a lack of coherence that seasons 5 and 6 tried to have, and the program has no heart now that the Kent parents are gone. Whether you need this season or not depends on whether you bought the first six and absolutely want the entire collection.""",0
"b""I have waited eagerly for The Mahabharata by Peter Brooks on DVD, and today it arrived. How disappointed I was to find this version is a little more than half that shown on the BBC and PBS.

"b'This movie made me cry so much and it was so sad that it is really hard to understand how I could recommend it so strongly. The chemistry between Nicholson and Freeman was amazing and they played wonderfully. The humor was a welcome relief to the immense emotional issue. This movie really made me think about what is important in life. I found several of the key themes in the film something to think about and consider with respect to my own life. I loved the questions of the pyramids: 1. Have you found joy in your life? 2. Did you bring joy to the lives of others? It is likely that this movie is not the one you turn to when you feel like something cheerful and funny. However, if you want to regain some perspective on what is important in life, this movie does a good job of making you think about what you want to achieve in life, particularly without being prudent.'",1

"b'`\'Alias \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\'\' is one of my favorite shows, even at its weakest point it was excellent compared to almost any other program on open television. The fifth season, while reinventing the show again, is very entertaining, exciting and exciting, and I recommend that anyone see it. However, I have serious and serious problems with this DVD release. Actually, I do not own it, because I bought the very complete complete collection of Rambaldi boxes (the five seasons of Aliases in one). But I\'ve seen the release of season five and it\'s terrible. Of the five DVD releases, it\'s the ugliest box. The image of the promotion is horrible, the green cover does not go well with the other stations, and the big words ""FINAL SEASON"" are simply tacky. The box does not have the size of other versions, it is what seems to be less than half an inch thick. This has also been a major problem for me, with Alias: Buena Vista changes the packaging for each season. Is very annoying. Also, special features are nothing. Some interesting features, but in general the supplements are very weak for the final season. Everything feels rushed and sloppy, like no one worries that this is the last season of a beloved series. If you can afford it, I strongly urge you to invest in the entire collection. It is very well made and assembled (although it does have its flaws) and has an extra extra disk that is very informative and fun to watch. However, only 40,000 are being made for supplies to be limited.'",0

"b'`` L\'Affaire du Collier \'\' can be based on a true story, but it is also an exciting historical romance, `` The Queen\'s Necklace \'\', by Alexandre Dumas, who undoubtedly had more than `` The Three Musketeers \'\'. \'in the sleeve. Dumas tells the identical story of Joseph Balsamo (also known as Count Cagliostro), Jeanne de la Motte Valois, the lustful but charming Cardinal de Rohan and the great diamond scam, although the filmmakers do not give any credit to Dumas (I note that the book is available) on Amazon.com, and I recommend it!). The costume designer, Malena Canonero, deserves applause for the fringes of silks, satins and lace jabots that magnificently recreate the opulence of Louis XVI\'s 18th century court. The configuration is also splendid. However, I found that much of the music was discordant, as the composer insisted on giving it a modern rhythm at times, and also used a hodgepodge of Mozart\'s `` Requiem \'\', among other things. I find such cuts and rearrangements of a bar here; A bar there, to be lazy and a little deceiving. In the film, the director explained that he wanted the period to be ""accessible"" for modern audiences. Such ""accessibility"" not only insults the intelligence of the modern audience, but also weakens the film. Because the story is so strong, however, I enjoyed the movie. He was particularly impressed with the performances of Jonathan Pryce as the gentle cardinal, Adrien Brody as the irresponsible husband of Jeanne, and Simon Baker, who is especially interesting as his love interest. They are all believable and move well in their silks. Even though Hilary Swank is an excellent actress, I thought she was wrong in this role. She looks a little uncomfortable with her suit and moves more like a twenty-first-century woman instead of an eighteenth-century woman. Leaving aside these reservations, I will keep this film and I will definitely see it again.'",1

"b'In general, I do not use the space provided for product reviews to comment on the condition of a particular piece of merchandise, or draw attention to a buyer who is not reputable. In this case, however, I will make an exception. The DVD that I received today, sold through Amazon LLC, which appears as `` Passport to Pimlico \'\' (Remastered Edition), is obviously a work done at home. The outer label is a color photocopy, the one on the DVD is black and white, for God\'s sake. Turn the DVD over and you can clearly see the band that makes the home recording on a recordable DVD. The manufacturer, A2ZCDs, seems to be a professional team, with a significant catalog, a nice website, etc. But I\'m not sure why this sale was not included in the list as coming from an external provider. (At least it comes from Amazon and makes it easier to go back). But what is more important, is not DVD home production just, well, illegal? Is not that piracy? My guess when I read the word `` remastered \'\' is that the print is made of an existing negative, or was significantly cleaned; I certainly hope that the studio, the filmmakers or at least the film historians have something to do with the production of the album. Maybe the one that runs A2ZCDs has done such a job on the home computer, but this is no excuse to cheat the general public.It might be that I\'m out of place and that the copyright in `` Passport to Pimlico \'\' ran years ago Maybe nobody owns the film and we all have so much right to photocopy it and sell it as the next guy. If so, my (saved) apologies to A2ZCDs. However, I believe that buyers should be aware that they are not receiving merchandise that somehow reflects what most of us who collect movies have come to think of as ""remastered"" or even professionally produced. I have a Panasonic DVD recorder and I make my own movie DVDs that I recorded on TMC video. In my wildest dreams, however, it would never occur to me to sell them. Maybe that makes me an idiot. If so, at least I\'m honest.'",0
"b""Here is a riddle for all of you. What do you call ten gallons of ice cream and a spoonful of fertilizer? Ten gallons of manure. I do not care how much you dress with the DVD version of this movie, it will not change the fact that it is terrible. I'm just giving him this star, but I have about five or six Advil on hand. That should be enough to cover him for this. A couple of little things about this disaster: 1. It's made by Uwe Boll, director of two of the WORST movies I've seen in 'House of the Dead' and 'Alone in the Dark'. In what (to me) was an amazing moment of brutal honesty, Boll himself admitted that he did not release the film until TWO WEEKS before the filming began. What ended with a lot of `` names '' that had a hole in their agenda and were presented for a quick salary and a free trip to Romania. It is also noticeable, the whole movie feels as if they had completely skipped and nobody seems to be half interested in making an honest effort. Will Sanderson and Michael Madsen may have discovered the only way to survive a Boll movie. It was reported that they were completely drunk throughout the production.4. Ben Kingsley, who previously had to deal with Madsen in the movie 'Species', even refused to be on the same set with him.5. In the scene of the harem with Pan con carne, those are HONEST FOR GOD, ROMAN PROSTITUTES 100% OF COMPLETE BLOOD. I swear you can not invent this. Apparently, Boll could not afford real actresses (his union fees made them too expensive), so he decided he could reduce costs simply by ordering the actual product. This is a disaster from front to back. However, I give this to you, it's better than your last two movies. 'Bloodrayne', at least, is a bit involuntarily fun. Even having said that, I could never recommend that anyone see this. It will only encourage the man to move on. UU Boll, without a doubt in my mind, is the most talented filmmaker I have ever seen in my life. I'm absolutely amazed that this guy keeps looking for his way behind a camera ...""",0
"b'""These are the continuous trips of USS Enterprise"" in blu ray. Well, we all know what Star Trek is about, so I\'m not going to go through the argument. I will say that the stories are very interesting, well thought out, well written and well interpreted. I really like how Star Trek touches the \'Human emotion and `` Human element\' \'. I want to talk about the transfer of blu-ray, and it\'s exceptional. The image is crystal clear and sharp like a razor. Honestly, I was speechless to see him. I grew up with ST: TNG, and it was like I was seeing everything again. The colors are very sharp, and I could not believe what I was seeing. I was always surprised at how picturesque and vibrant the images are. When I was reading other reviews, there were many complaints about the sound. UPDATE: it seems that the more you get into the episodes, sometimes, the worse it gets. One of the episodes seems to have been recoded in a bathroom, echoed and muffled. Although it\'s not perfect, I\'m still happy to have it. *** UPDATE 10/6: if you have the initial set, you will have problems with the sound in some of the episodes. CBS / Paramount is having a disk exchange. Just send them an email to: phe.stng @ bydeluxe.com. They will request the code on the back of the disc inside right. It may be difficult to see, but it is there. It took them about a week to send me the blu rays replacements. *** Usually, I do not care about the extras when it comes to DVD, but this has many of them, and they are fantastic. Now, for the price. Yes, it\'s very expensive, but it\'s worth it. I went from buying the DVD and I waited for the blu ray, and friend, I\'m glad I did it. The wait was worth it. If you know someone who is a Star Trek fan, it is a must for them. They will not regret getting this, and neither did I when I bought it.

"b""This 1955 release is one of those smaller films by Akira Kurosawa that is overlooked in favor of his larger films like & quot; Rashomon & quot; and & quot; Seven samurai & quot; but it's still worth seeing. The great Toshiro Mifune plays an industrialist in post-World War II Japan, who is slowly going crazy with the idea that a nuclear war is looming and tries to convince his family (and his lovers) to flee from Japan with him. Mifune's obsessive image is a great tragedy, especially when he vainly begs his greedy family to leave and Takashi Shimura, the samurai leader on & quot; Seven samurai & quot; , is also effective as a counselor who tries to help straighten out the disaster. The film captures the Japanese fear of the atomic bomb, a theme that Kurosawa would also address in his masterpiece, & quot; Ikiru & quot; , very well and with the greedy family approaching a delirious patriarch, brings to mind & quot; King Lear & quot; , a story that the director would return years later in & quot; Ran & quot; . This is a small movie by one of the best directors in the world but very good.""",1
"b'I had been anxious to see this film version of H.G. Wells\' classic novel, as the producers claimed that they would remain true to the original location and period of late Victorian Britain. Initially, I had been delayed in purchasing this film since its original release in 2005 due to the initial and significant amount of complaints. of low production values, poor effects, below-average performance and ""endless walking scenes"". Suffice it to say that my passion for the novel and the courisity took hold of me and I had to watch this movie on my own. Basically I was aware of the shortcomings and had no high expectations of production, therefore, I can say in all honestly, I enjoyed the film despite the flaws that are too numerous to list here and that have already been addressed by reviewers a lot. more eloquent than me. The editing of scenes and events would confuse a viewer who has not read the original novel and would soon lose the plot when the film changes between the scenes of the narrator in Woking and his brother in London. At one particular moment, the brother is supposedly on a London street and suddenly witnesses the attack on the Elfinstone ladies on a country road and runs to his rescue. Mario\'s red grass appears right after the attack on Woking and Shepperton without explanation within the film at any time as to what it really is. Much has been said of the encounter between HMS Thunderchild and the Martians when the brother escapes from England in a `` steamboat \'\', suffice it to say that it is really horrible and it would have been better to have been omitted altogether. There is a much-anticipated scene in which the legs of a tripod move towards and over an artillery battery, which is probably the best effect within this film and shows what could have been. Act? There is a really horrible dialogue between the characters. I challenge anyone, for example, not to end up shrinking when they see the exchange between the Elfinstone ladies and the brother as they ""discuss"" how they are going to escape from England. He would also award the James Doohan Award for the worst Scottish accent seen in the film since Brigadoon when the narrator converses with a soldier on Horsell Common. In contrast, when he observes the interaction with the actors trapped in the ruined house, and also the meeting of the narrator of the dead woman in a street of ""London"", he regrettably recalls what could have been. I gave him this. 2 star movie that is generous and for the following reasons. The score of the music is fantastic. It is refreshing that the film is true to the events of the book and has strived, albeit wrongly, to establish the book in Victorian England and not yet another updated version in the United States. Unfortunately due to cost constraints, British-style buildings are digitized and configured Monty Python style within a field in the state of Washington to represent Woking, Shepperton or London. I liked the design of the combat machines, also the manipulators in the pit scenes. Especially My 17-year-old daughter who saw this movie was not impressed at all, but was intrigued with the location and location of the films. As a result, he has endeavored to read the novel and, to my surprise, read it from beginning to end. The irony is that H.G Wells has won another young admirer despite the very poor quality of this film and for this I am really grateful. However, would you recommend this movie to a friend? Unfortunately, not if I wanted them to remain friends.'",0
"b'Anyone who is reading these reviews will have seen the production of TV and will know it closely; therefore, I will limit my review to the quality of the DVD image, or rather, the lack of it. It is a pity that what used to be a beautiful and memorable television movie has become a battered and vanished shadow of his former self. It is painful to see that something that has a special place in your heart is treated with such misery. For years, the only version that millions of people had seen on television had a faded color and a contrast so low that it almost seemed shot in black and white. If that is what you are used to, & quot; restored & quot; The version of this DVD (and the one shown on TV for the last 3 or 4 years) looks marginally better, but is barely restored. You just have to look at a deleted song in the extras section to see how beautiful and bright the original production was: crisp, clear, pristine, with highly saturated colors. The time and money SHOULD have been spent to bring the rest of the film to this standard. It is morally wrong to put a defective product on the market, then have the courage to collect money for it. As many of our parents probably told us when we were young, & quot; Everything worthwhile is worth it! & quot;'",0
"b'THEY COME EARLY IN THE MORNING. Have you ever seen a movie and thought after \'\' that man is real \'\', but not as a documentary, but simply as a piece of cinema that seems taken out of real life? If you have ever felt this way, chances are you were seeing this right here. `\'Eat Early Morning \'\' is a wonderful little movie made wonderfully by Joey Lauren Adams from` `Chasing Amy \'\' and starring the great Ashley Judd and, of course, Jeffrey Donovan. Honestly, it seems that the cameras were installed throughout the city and this is what was captured, it feels real. The film follows Lucy Fowler {Judd} on her journey through her thirties waking up each morning with one useless guy after another. She is also dealing with a father with whom she is desperately trying to pass the time even if it seems that he does not care. The story says that she is a desperate and confused woman who only seeks love and acceptance. Of course, you could say that her problems with men are due to her estranged relationship with her father. Still, he ends up meeting at least one decent guy named Cal Percell (played excellently by Donovan) who seems to want a relationship with her despite her problem. This is the relationship here that is the driving force of the movie, although the time spent with his father and roommate also adds an interesting dynamic. The best of all this is how everything ends. Screenwriter / director Adams shows that all the time he spent with Kevin Smith was worth it because it\'s a wonderful debut movie. His address is excellent, but it is his writing that really makes this movie so good. Like I said, this has to be one of the most real movies I\'ve seen in a long time. I like the fact that it did not romanticize the main character and his problems, things do not end up as you want. This movie has an ending that is probably what will really happen, how good is that? Even those who have not grown up in a small town can relate to the things that happen in this movie. Ashley Judd is of course brilliant as the lost thirty-year-old trying to find her way. And you know that Jeffery Donovan is excellent as the boy that should have been for her. Laura Prepon of the fame of ""That\'s 70\'s Show"" is as good as Judd\'s roommate and best friend, she even finds love. Scott Wilson is also brilliant because she finds her father in the religion who seems to be as out of touch as she is. As a matter of fact, the entire cast is excellent and deserves all the credit in the world. Apart from that, the film was also filmed very well and for such a limited budget it seems that the film showed the whole city, although it was not like that. I would have to say that this is one of the best films that has come out in a while, and a wonderful debut for a filmmaker. For those who seem to have this, I say spread the word and review it now. And for those who have not yet seen, I recommend this as a purchase, but I guess you can try to rent it. This is a wonderful movie with a great cast with real problems that everyone should be able to relate to. I would love to go on this movie, but all you can imagine is to see it, if it\'s not your thing, it\'s fine, but for those who like this kind of movies you will enjoy this a lot.'",1

The Mini Coopers are the real stars in this movie!

"b""Down pathetic right. It is safe to say that this is the case and I will mark it as Stephen Dorff (Cecil B.

Slater is associated with former archaeologist Tara Reid (Van Wilder, Urban Legend, Cruel Intentions) and his old friend, for whom he used to work in the government's elite group ... played by Dorff. All cast the film we suffer from great throbbing headaches while watching a badly scripted and neglected movie with twists and turns in which we know who is going to die and live. Directed by the director of House Of The Dead, Uwe Boll, and I can tell you that this movie is Bolls ** t. He can not direct shit. What a waste of actors and what a waste of my time.

But while he takes them to chalk painting countryside and tea parties on the roof, his father is less happy. Can he be seen beyond the tip of his nose? Ok, then this movie is really little more than an excuse for the singing and dancing numbers. It\'s still great! The plot is very thin, and you lose your place in the middle of some of its fantastic scenes. Of course, part of that is because the film is based on a book that is nothing more than short stories. This movie is still more about fun than anything else. And he has that in spades. What child would not have fun imagining that they would do all the things that Jane and Michael do in this movie? It is said that Walt Disney poured everything he had learned to make this film, and it shows. Many of the special effects are remarkably well maintained today. There were some that I had not discovered until I saw this special edition. And music! Any Disney fan knows these songs by heart. And you can not help but find yourself humming ""A Spoonful of Sugar"", ""Jolly Holiday"", ""Let\'s fly a kite"" or ""Chim Chim Cher-ee"" for days after seeing it. Those who want to have a great DVD of this movie will not be disappointed in this two-disc game. Disc one presents the film in all its widescreen splendor. I can not see how it looks better. The soundtrack has many different options, but the Home Theater mix will leave you in awe. It\'s fantastic . There is also a comment track with Julie Andrews, Dick van Dyke, Karen Dubice (Jane) and Richard Sherman. The comments of others are sprayed, including Disney itself. Also included are some emerging facts to read along with while watching the movie. Disc two features a new documentary about the film, a deleted song and more about music with Julie, Dick and the composers. And make sure you watch the animated film ""The Cat that Looked at a King,"" a story adapted from one of the later books in the series. One thing that comes loud and clear in this set is the fun that everyone had. doing it and how much they respect Walt Disney. The fact that this film has lasted 40 years is testimony to his genius. With this set, it will be enjoyed by future generations.'",1
"b""I would not go as far as the previous critic by saying it is a kind of liberal conspiracy movie (and if it is, I'd hate to hear what people say about films like Ferngully and Once Upon A Forest). I doubt that the fact that most humans care little for our impact on the environment is a notorious news for anyone, not the fact that some of us kill other living creatures for a number of reasons ranging from fun to reality. Having said that, however, I can not give this movie a better rating. The CG animation is of a quality * much * inferior to the one made by the cover (more in line with a Saturday morning caricature than a real length film). I do not think I found a single funny joke in the whole movie, and more than a few scenes were so rude that I preferred to look the other way instead of seeing them. The images are often dark and untraining (the woman who tries to decapitate a cat with a chainsaw comes to mind), and the outdoor scenes look very easy. The animation has several parts that are notoriously poor compared to a good (or even decent) CG movie. In addition, humans are distorted almost beyond recognition. In summary, there are many good CG titles, but this certainly is not one of them.""",0

The script itself is entertaining with philosophies and suspense uninterrupted. I would recommend this movie very strongly as a training video for those people in professions where leadership is the key to success.

"b'I love the Murder She Write Series and I anticipated the launch of the program on DVD. I have both Season 1 and Season 2. I love watching the episodes, but I am very disappointed with the quality of the DVDs. I understand that it does not happen with every DVD set, but many of the sets (including mine) have DVDs that skip and stop. I have to skip entire chapters of the shows just to get to the next episode. The problem is using both sides of the DVD to store the episodes. If some research was done on the two-sided DVDs before presenting this wonderful show in the most economical two-sided format, then we would not have so many DVD sets skipping. I really wish they had gone for the best quality route and not for the cheapest route.'",0
"b'The Sons of Paradise by Marcel Carne is successful on so many levels that they deserve to be called one of the best films of all time. Carne filmed the film in parts during the Nazi occupation of Paris. His film was officially supported despite the occupation, since the Nazis wanted to show that they were friendly with the arts. This created the ironic situation in which Carne was taking money from the government to support a daytime film and channel aid to the French resistance at night. An actor was supposed to be a Nazi collaborator. He disappeared mysteriously during the filming and had to be replaced. Despite all these obstacles, Carne has managed to recreate magnificently Paris of the nineteenth century. In this way, the film itself is a triumph of the creative spirit. The title refers to the poor, who could only afford such high seats in the theater that they were almost in the beams ... and yet these were the real audiences. the actors showed up for. The story is a series of crossed lives that revolve in one way or another around the bohemian and tired Garance (played Mona Lisa style by Arletty). Beyond this, the film also revolves around the theater life of 1840 in Paris: the actors, the public and everyone in between. Garance is almost a courtesan: she conveniently moves between four men who love her, apparently unaffected by any of them ... in the end, she falls in love with the mime Baptiste (Jean-Louis Barrault) ... but Baptiste is married to another woman after losing her chance with Garance years before. Will they come together? In the end, we, the spectators are both the Sons of the Gods, or the Sons of Paradise, that the title refers to the theater audience in the film. In fact, both opening and closing credits are played against a theater curtain. We are the spectators in the Gods, and the actors are performing for us living their lives: loving, living, dying ... feeling pain and joy. The Meat movie lasts more than three hours, but it never gets delayed. The stories cross each other and can not be adequately described in a simple review like this ... Four men love Garance, and somehow all their lives intersect in and around the theater. The cinematography is incredible. There is a crowd scene at the end of the film that resists anything filmed: it is simply magnificent. Baptiste is lost (in many ways) in a moving mass of humanity. This single scene is reason enough to see the movie. I suspect that this is a movie that people love or hate. Long duration can discourage many people, but it is a pity. The movie is not for those who want instant gratification. Instead, it is something to enjoy and savor. If all this makes it seem too serious, rest assured that it is not. Children of Paradise is a tragedy in some aspects, but it is also a comedy in the sense of Shakespeare. This was a movie made for a company like Criterion, and they do it justice in their DVD edition. The two halves of the film are presented on individual discs, so the film never suffers compression failures or other problems. The restoration is perfect: you never know that this movie is almost sixty years old. The audio is cute but very clean, without whistling or static. Criterion has also included some supplements, interviews, filmographies, trailers, etc., but the real pleasure is the film itself. It is timeless'",1
"b'I want to start by saying that this is the best Blu Ray release that I have bought to date. The packaging is wonderful, with its hard cover ""souvenir"" aesthetic, and the additional bonus features alone make it worth the low price they ask for. See the actual footage of Linda Blair (with all the makeup no less) on the set is priceless and definitely outperforms the extras from previous releases. As for the important things ... THE MOVIE. I have to say that this has become my favorite movie of all time. I am not in any way a fan of terror. I have some favorites of the genre ... but I opt more for comedy and / or fantasy. I like to laugh or get away from reality completely. Questions: ""So why in EARTH would you consider The Exorcist as your favorite movie?"" ""Simple.It\'s a modern parable and it\'s one of those rare movies that really produces the desired effect in every frame."" `The Exorcist ""Like a horror movie, it\'s a bit short-sighted."" It\'s a spiritual drama, a psychological thriller, and a supernatural story ... all in one.37 years later, it\'s still valid and as relevant today as it was then. The difference here is that we now live in a society that is, as Blatty says in the documentary Fear Of God `` completely jaded and depraved. \'\' Nothing here seems to shock and 14-year-olds now see this movie as ""laughable."" It\'s a shame, because there\'s so much more than pea soup and rotating heads here, it\'s really about the terror of the unknown ... the fear and the restlessness that all metaphysical and spiritual things imply, it\'s about the mystery of faith and its capacity ad to ultimately triumph. The sights, the sounds and the history ... they all mix here. It is incredibly well written by Blatty. Friedkin\'s sense of documentary realism serves the plot well. The performance is first class by a cast that could not have been more perfect. The makeup of Dick Smith is innovative, not only with Linda Blair, but with Max Von Sydow, who was between 40 and 40 years old at that time. Also worthy of mention is Owen Roizman\'s use of various clear textures and, of course, his masterful and iconic image of Merrin\'s arrival. I was fortunate to see the screening of Fathom on September 30 and, seeing this movie on a big screen with digital sound was fantastic, I have yet to say that it works better and provides more disconcerting feelings when you look at home ... in the darkness. That\'s the really scary angle in this movie ... it reminds us that no matter how safe we \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bthink we are (even in our own home with all the lights on), there\'s nothing the real evil does not do and nowhere go to manifest.'",1
"b""Let me start by saying that I love & quot; Oh My Goddess & quot; and I was really looking forward to the DVD release of the series. It's very sweet, fun and easily one of the most charmingly romantic series I've seen. I am very happy to spend some time with Belldandy, Keichi, Skuld and Urd. Having said that, I am impressed and disappointed to discover that they divided the series into two DVDs, each one for sale separately. The episodes are very short, totaling a little over an hour per DVD (I think it's 82 minutes for Vol. 1, and 62 minutes for Vol. 2). There are no additional features included. Oh! That's a lot for two and a half hours of viewing. I find it hard to believe that Animego could not do more justice to this excellent series, or provide more value to its customers. The six parts & quot; Moldiver & quot; OAV managed to find its way on a DVD at a good price. How disappointing is that & quot; Oh My Goddess & quot; I could not do the same.

"b'Maduro is not an exploitative Lolita sex movie as super-saturated art might suggest. Instead, it is a challenging and unconventional exploration of female sexuality and maturity, imaginatively directed and well acted by its three clues. The script sometimes becomes rudimentary like many indie movies (too many bad words are a curse in independent scripts), but the film is visually stunning, and the accumulation of small moments is delicious, when Violet discovers adult magazines, for example , or when the abrupt man who takes the sisters has to explain the menstruation. And the final scene with the two sisters is devastating, a strange amalgam of suspense, family drama and psychosexual connotations. A wonderful musical score by Anton Sanko (ex-Suzanne Vega Band) increases this aesthetically excellent film, curiously moving and finally very dark. .'",1
"b'The Iron Giant is a loose adaptation of a wonderful book of the same title, by Ted Hughes (written in the late sixties). In the book, the origins of the giant are unknown, and he is initially buried under the ground before being attacked and, finally, befriended. The enemy in the book, which becomes a common enemy for both humans and the giant and the cause of their alliance, was a giant dragon-like creature (as big as Australia!) To which the giant ends for cheating. In the film, set during the Cold War, and presenting a wonderful portrait of the atmosphere of the 50s, the enemy is EE. UU and our tendency to fear what is strange, and shoot first and ask questions later. I think this is, in the end, deeper. Of course, the original author may have had some of those allegories in mind when he wrote the original book, since the dragon from outer space ends up destroying and enveloping a large part of the planet in darkness, almost like a world war. But in that case, is it supposed that its alliance with the giant means an alliance with military technology to prevent a world war? In the film, the robot is just a fantastic robot from outer space, which humans can choose to make friends or establish as enemies. In any case, this is easily one of the best animated films to leave the United States. States in the last decade (and one of the others is by the same director, Brad Bird).'",1
"b""I do not remember the last time I was so entertained with a movie that I saw it three times in 24 hours. STILL CRAZY took me out of my bleak and somewhat fertile middle-aged existence and transported me back to my college years in the seventies, when I was in a part-time ragtag band. Make no mistake: the film shows the chaotic, extravagant, self-centered, authoritarian and irresistibly dysfunctional behavior of rock musicians. The antics of the characters, even in middle age, when they try to revive their careers, brought a plethora of memories. I can also remember concerts that had gone wrong; members of the band shouting chords to each other during a song; the frequent & quot; artistic & quot; disagreements; improvised impromptu sessions in barns, garages, empty rooms of the high school band; and the excitement of connecting with an audience (usually a drunken audience). Buy this movie ... rent this movie ... watch this movie. It is more than just a comedy; There is a very real human component that transcends even the tumultuous world of the music industry. You will laugh, you will remove a tear from time to time and you will be entertained. The flame still burns. God bless rock 'n roll!""",1
"b'At the end of this film, the character of Janet Jackson takes her to be her ex-husband until her death and ends up smiling at the end of the film while contemplating her next sexual prospect. This movie ended up like a horror movie. It is a terrible example for any black woman who may be watching. That kind of sadistic and aggressive behavior is what you might read in the news, not in a romantic comedy or drama or whatever this melodrama was supposed to be. I hope that black women do not see this movie and think that the end of the movie was good because it was quite sinister. Black men also seem unusually weak, while black women seem to be dominant. No man really wants a dominant and noisy woman, no matter what Tyler Perry says. This movie gave me nightmares.'",0
"b""I have a VHS copy of ALICE IN ACIDLAND, purchased from Something Weird years ago. I'm a big fan of the 60's drug / exploitation movies and ALICE IN ACIDLAND has always been one of my favorites. Finally I upgraded to DVD and was completely disappointed. This ALICE DVD is a cut and censored version of the movie. Ten to fifteen second pieces have been raised from time to time, leaving jarring jump cuts in place. And near the end of the movie, a whole scene has been eliminated. The cut footage is all shots that contain full frontal nudity and / or the most brutal violence. The cuts are obvious; no attempt was made to make them flow with the movie ... the narration of the music and the voiceover cut clumsily with each instance of clipping footage. The runtime information in the box is even incorrect ... in the box, the original ALICE runtime appears in the list: 62 minutes. But the DVD version only has 53 minutes with all the cuts. I've been an admirer of Something Weird for years ... But now I'm disappointed with the company. They used to be a refuge for unfiltered exploitation, without PC, totally obscene, horrifying, psychedelic and just a completely strange cinema ... things that the masses would not care about. So, why CUT a movie to (supposedly) attract the masses? ? ? I hesitate before buying another DVD Something Weird. I give this DVD 2 stars instead of one because the other material on this DVD is pretty good. But I do not think this DVD is worth your money.""",0

"b'In a few words: style on substance. There are some excellent sequences, but that is all that this film seems to be, well planned and executed sequences, but with nothing consistent sticking the whole set. The `plane near the accident and the last minute of rescue \'is performed extremely impressive and the machine gun ammunition that hits Supe\'s chest followed by the bullet in the eye is magnificent. My jaw was dropping and I almost wanted to cheer up. That\'s what Superman is about: watching him defeat the bad guys in new, attractive and even fun ways. But that\'s where the fun ended. As what Superman is not about is to love children and ridiculous heroic shots with kryptonite. I find that both are so terribly implausible that both should be ridiculed. As Brodie (skilfully played by Jason Lee in Kevin Smith\'s Mallrats) points out, ""It\'s impossible! Lois Lane could never have Superman\'s baby."" Do you think the fallopian tubes could handle your sperm? sexual intercourse, he probably unloads a load like a shotgun blast ... through his back. ""So, other than Lois Lane being alive after intercourse, then it would be impossible for a human being to conceive and bring the child to term. of a foreigner. ""Do not forget that just because Clark Kent looks and apparently acts like a human, he is an alien, he is a completely different species, and completely different species can not mate, just think of the havoc it would cause in the animal kingdom if a lion falls in love and mates with a crocodile or a guinea fowl The other issue that makes me tremble with anger is the cretin concept that Superman is physically capable of to rocket a whole continent of kryptonite towards outer space. As the internet blogger dpogue21 expresses it so skillfully (much better than me, so thank you, digegue) in his immediate criticism, `` My next big complaint [is] that Superman raises a continent made of kryptonite into outer space. You do not have to be a Simpson-type comic to point out what\'s wrong with that. I do not know how many comics Bryan Singer has read, but when Superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite, he barely has the strength to stay on his feet. Whoever had the idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bblowing up a large island made out of its greatest weakness in space, has nothing to do with any project related to Superman. The concept is as ridiculous as making a Dracula movie where the title character has a stake in his heart and still manages to fly a spaceship made of garlic in the sun. Why does not it just cause Superman to eat kryptonite? He can eat it and then brush his teeth with it, and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajamas. That is no more absurd than taking it to a continent of kryptonite in space and then falling powerless through the atmosphere without burning in the reentry or splashing the entire central park when it falls to the ground. \'\' I need to say more? I do not think so. ** [...]'",0
"b'I was surprised that the editorial revisions of this film treated it like one more movie, which is definitely NOT. I would describe it in several ways: like the film that John Waters would give his left hand to make; as a shipment NEAR dramatic, intense, tear-filled dance films such as Red Shoes, which takes off its hat at the concept of `` camp \'\' without throwing away all the experience to maintain consistency with attitude; like a comedy that, if you understand the joke, will leave you speechless with laughter at times. There are times when I was not sure of the movie I was in, like the plot listed for Flashdance and then Cinderella. But this is the kind of movie that it is; it embraces operatic emotion and high melodrama, and while it recognizes the ordinary, it never is. And it communicates wonderfully the essential madness of all inclusive endogamic subcultures. (The constant exhortations of the old guard to the hero not to indulge in ""movements that please the crowd"") are hilariously absurd, and at the same time totally typical of such subcultures, where the most sensible question is always ""Who? the earth, these rules?! `) is a strange and intense film, which keeps you unconsciously out of balance, and asks you if you take it seriously or as an elaborate dream of filmed comedy (think of Rocky Horror Picture Show). good is that you never have to decide, you can enjoy new aspects in multiple visualizations.'",1
"b""Ridley Scott's Alien must be considered one of the best thrillers ever put on celluloid. It is classified there with films like Hitchcock 's Psycho and Tod Browning' s Dracula (1931). Alien is more or less a classic movie of the haunted house, but instead of an old tenebrous Victorian manor house, we have an old, lugubrious and massive space freighter and the endless darkness of space itself. Alien exceeds her B movie credentials - this film is really a B movie in the background - with a very tense and intelligent script, and an exceptional direction from Ridley Scott. From the long opening sequence of the Nostromo that fills the screen, the audience knows that it will be treated with an exceptionally filmed film. Ridley Scott has always been known for his artistic direction and the biomechanical aspect of Alien sets helps to increase the sensation of terror and terror. Help Scott and his team decide to hire the famous Swiss surrealist H.R. Giger to design the look of the sets and the creatures. Anyone who has seen Giger's work can easily see its influence on the stage design for Alien. The final design of Giger for the main creature will become one of the best creations in the history of cinema. For now, everyone knows what to imagine in their heads when someone mentions the words Alien and they film together. The group of actors chosen for the film is excellent from top to bottom. The captain of Tom Skerritt. Dallas is a solid base on which the rest of the characters revolve. The slow decline of Veronica Cartwright's personality to hysteria - totally appropriate to the situation she and the rest of her classmates face - is like a barometer of the growing fear that permeates the film from beginning to end. The standout of the cast must be Sigourney Weaver. The fact that this was her first important role in the cinema is a good omen of what the public could expect from her when her career exploded. His character from Lieutenant Ellen Ripley is more or less the antithesis of Lambert de Cartwright. While Lambert slowly descended to a paralyzing hysteria, Ripley took control of the situation and became the de facto leader after Dallas. The overall tone of the film owes much to the past: terror / sci-fi thrillers. But instead of constant scares and false leads, Scott slowly increased the tension and fear with slow slow taps of empty hallways and cargo holds. For a movie that is considered one of the best horror movies ever made, Alien does not have many dark areas where the monster suddenly jumps. The monster will leave well lit and spacious areas. Scott also used the Spielberg trick to prevent the monstrous creature from appearing on the screen for more than a few moments. It is not until the end when we see the alien creature of Giger in all its splendor. This new version of the many editions of Alien DVD has finally arrived with re-edited scenes that add more impact and horror to the film. I have to agree with Scott's reasoning to eliminate the scenes themselves. It reduces the speed of the roller coaster, constant rhythm in the last part of the film. But in the comfort of the home theater itself, these re-edited scenes are easier to assimilate. The look of the cut of the original and theatrical film has been remastered and it looks great, especially when seen on a DVD player with progressive scanning capability and a dedicated panoramic HDTV. Sound and music also received a 4-star remastering treatment to make better use of home theater systems that grow in number. Alien is the most superior entry in Alien Quadrilogy, even though Aliens is a more exciting movie. Alien takes the genre of science fiction horror and sets a standard that many have yet to achieve to this day.""",1

"b""The last robbery of a professional thief and his team goes terribly wrong, and the organizer of impeccable plans receives more than he expected. The agents and the mobsters chase him, but he remains calm under pressure, frustrates the plans of others and can always get out of the mud. This is a standard story format for the action movie. It looks clich and eacute; d and predictable, but it works well with good pace in action and with the director's safe guidance. But `` 7 Seconds '' does not have them. Wesley Snipes plays the thief named Jack. Jack's failed robbery in Bucharest, Romania, leads to a new problem because his girlfriend / partner in crime is kidnapped during the shootings. He takes a NATO military policeman (Tamzin Outhwaite wearing his British accent) hostage after the chaos (and also saves his life), and gets involved in the pursuit of urban cars with familiar surroundings. The story does not make much sense (why steal casinos' money in Romania?), But the earlier part of `` 7 Seconds' 'is fun, with decent acrobatics and a bit of humor. The actions are confusing and you do not know where these cars are running wildly, but at least the acrobatics are not bad. Then, in the tedium of the central section of the film settles, which stops the actions and begins to introduce superfluous characters, plus an unnecessary twist of the plot or two. We do not need to see Wesley Snipes walking in the station and placing a wallet in the coin locker there. Or, in reality, we do not care what the briefcase really contains; and we do not even want to know if something in it (whatever it is) is real or not. We want emotion and action, or fun dialogues. Except for some short acrobatics of martial arts and mildly fun jokes between Snipes and Outhwaite, `` 7 Seconds '' does not have much to show, particularly in its second part, where the film has another sequence of doubles involving trams, but it is marked by a choppy edition. We often hear complaints or criticisms about direct movies to video, but in reality some of them are quite good, offering fun 90 minutes like the films of Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren. Unfortunately, for all the pretty good acting of the stars, `` 7 seconds '' of Wesley Snipes is not one of them.""",0

"b""The Crucible, based on the work of Arthur Miller, is an entertaining, though not always accurate, version of the events at 1692 Salem Village. After having read numerous books on the subject, I still can not say with certainty what it was that led to the events that so many men and women were accused of witchcraft and that so many young people seemed distressed. One may wonder why it was only the Salem 's females, and not the men who seemed afflicted with screams, catatonic states, hallucinations, etc ... In any case, a conclusion that could not be drawn was that of a woman scorned, in this case Abigail Williams played by Winona Ryder whose advances are rejected by the married John Proctor (Daniel Day Lewis). The Proctors are also much younger in the movie than in real life. John was sixty years old when he was hanged. Elizabeth would be around 40 years old at the time of testing. The pregnancy saved her from the hangman's rope. The film maintains a good dose of precision in the treatment of the slave Tituba and his part in the whole affair, as well as the accusations against some of the `` creators of problems '' of the city. like Goody Nurse and Giles Corey who was pressured to death for refusing to testify. The scenes in the audience room were the most dynamic and exciting, and reminded those vintage paintings of ancient books that represented the trials with severe judges and Puritans who pointed fingers at the accusers. The film also did a good job of capturing that stifling 17th century, repressive environment and costumes was the first rate.The best performances for me came from those men who portray the various ministers and judges, especially Bruce Davison as the Reverend Parris and Paul Scofield as Judge Danforth. Although it is not a completely accurate movie, it continues to do a good job of capturing one of the most important events in early American history. Reviewed by Tim Janson""",1

"b'This film starts fast and quickly immerses the viewer in a very strange world with dialogue and action that burns making it difficult to keep up. The important thing is to stay there and the pieces will begin to fit together. The film is based on a novel by Philip K. Dick who is known for his very original imagination and who has contributed ideas for different stories to anyone else. This is another one of those original stories and takes the viewer to an unbridled journey. Fortunately the pieces begin to fit together and do so with the dramatic use of surround speakers and lots of action on the screen. The basic premise of the film is that a technology has been developed that allows you to see a crime before it actually happens, so that the police can intervene and stop the crime before it has taken place. Just as this system of crime prevention is ready to go to the whole country, something happens that changes everything. The character of Tom Cruise, a policeman named John Anderton, suddenly finds himself plunged into a situation that threatens his own life. Now you must use the crime prevention system called Precrime to discover the truth and find out who is willing to incriminate you. Your search for the truth provides the basis for this exciting action movie. I urge the viewer to give the film a chance because, although at first it may seem confusing, it quickly becomes a good science fiction adventure movie.'",1
"b'Some people in Germany have accused this film of trying to ""render harmless"" the crimes of the Third Reich. This could not be further from the truth, and I will explain why. Bruno Ganz interprets Hitler as the man. Hitler, the man who loves his dog, who is kind to his secretary, who loves his friends and spits at people who think he is betrayed, who tells those he cares to save himself even as he prepares to take cyanide, commit suicide and then be burned This is a guy that, while he is not talking about the Jews or world domination, it would not be so difficult to live with him. HOWEVER, this is still Hitler\'s monster. Being a vegetarian does not absolve him of being directly responsible for the death of millions or of throwing the whole world into war. Hitler, the two-dimensional monster, is inseparable from Hitler, the three-dimensional man, and that\'s what this film reminds us every time it makes you feel sorry for him even if you know, and the movie reminds you that he was a monster. All the monsters in history - past, present and future - were, are and will be human beings. We like to imagine Hitler as a kind of inhuman monster, but he was only human. Too human. That\'s why this movie makes people feel uncomfortable; Reminds them that any ""man who looks like a good partner"" leader of men could turn out to be a monster if the right questions are never asked or the ideas are never questioned. The warning is uncomfortable: no ideologist can be trusted at face value. Not one, never. And / that / is the true importance of this film, if `` Never again \'\' is to have some kind of real that is, next to a slogan. If I were a history teacher, I would show this movie followed by / Schindler\'s List /. Both are equally true, and equally important in history: all this horror comes from simple humans.'",1

"b""I have been and continue to be a faithful admirer of Xena and Gabrielle. Let me remind you of those who liked the end of something. Real life is full of sadness, misery, loss and tragedy. We watch television and movies to escape from reality. Xena was a tragic figure at the beginning of her life. She killed for little or no reason. But she saw that I was wrong. She changed her ways and fought for justice. There is no way to give life back to the murdered. But Xena repented and devoted her life to fighting for good. He risked his life many times to save the lives of many others. (Let those without sin throw the first stone) We need a heroine like Xena. We want to see that those in the `` white hats '' win and the bad ones in the `` black hats '' lose. I know that reality does not work that way many times. But Xena was different. She's special. I think it's very unpleasant, very tragic and pathetic that Xena has had to die. And if dying was not enough, decapitating her made my stomach churn. I own the whole series. But I will never see the last episode again. Say these two stars because the tragic and unnecessary death of Xena presents a flaw in the entire series.""",0

"b'A long time ago, in a ... This movie also starts with scroll text, pity that it takes almost five minutes. On the positive side, when the text ends, you could save yourself about 90 minutes of anguish and leave. This film will definitely defy Plan 9 from outer space as the worst horror film ever made. The biggest difference between the movie and the video game is the reset button. I kept looking for one in the theater. You would expect second-class performances by Tara Reid but not by Christian Slater or Stephen Dorff. The love scene, if you could call it one (I do not remember any love scene in the game) has managed to establish sexual relations 1,000 years ago. Congratulations to Uwe Boll for continuing the excellent tradition of doing B-Movie. Ed would have been proud.'",0
"b""I rented this because I enjoy westerns and because Michael Madsen is an actor that I like. Forget this . In the first twenty minutes I completely lost interest: the acting was actually far below normal for a high school production, and Madsen was hardly involved in it. Apparently the director, Christopher Forbes, is producing fast and amateur productions with his friends in most of the roles and with a known name to head. (See Amazon's review here of `'All Hell Broke Loose '',` `starring the late David Carradine, I did not write it, but it also sums up this movie.) The cover of this dog has a 'revise' something like `` 3:10 Yuma rides against True Grit. '' If there is a '' scam '' for you to buy or rent a movie, this package is the right one. Save your money and check back the versions of the two films, the cover references. Actually, I would be angry if all this was not so fun and I hope I saved you some dollars here.""",0

I'm sure this is a wonderful DVD for those who have danced before or who choose to take dance steps REALLY fast.

I need to make a new step 3-4 times before I am ready to tackle the next one. The rhythm was the speed of lightening, which is very bad because the movements are beautiful.""",0

"b""For a long time an admirer of Irish music, I have turned to a series of artists to satisfy my appetite. Bing Crosby and John McCormick have been replaced by the Irish tenors.

Sandwiched between these tunes are traditional Irish songs like `` Macushla '' and `` Croppy Boy '', along with newer songs, such as `` The Green Fields Of France '' and `` How are things in Glocca Morra? `` The singing is excellent, the words are understandable.

"b""Warner Brothers again shows us that when they do not care, NOT THEY COSTS YOU. It's not just a lack of extras, it's a lack of ... um ... PART OF THE MOVIE.

Now they die without a groan. This is a movie that would normally give 4 or even 5 stars, but WB has released all this without even bothering to check the sound mix, or maybe they have edited it in some way incomprehensible to me. For whatever reason, it would almost be better to buy the VHS since it will have the full soundtrack and probably look almost as good. And let's not even talk about the terrible coverage they have put on the movie. In general, WB should be ashamed of its overflowing apathy, especially since we will probably never see another edition of this film without caring (if it were published in another country).""",0

"b'Director Jon Reiss and producer Tracy Wares take us on a graffiti world tour in `` Bomb It \'\'. The film is more favorable to the art of graffiti than against it, but interviews people whose mission is to free neighborhoods of graffiti and graffiti artists on 4 continents. There is a background that questions who should decide what we look at in public spaces, a provocative question but that is not really the focus of the film. `` Bomb It \'\' covers a lot of ground in the history and scope of graffiti art, but with good results, since we can see that graffiti artists are not all the same. Graffiti has evolved over time, and its purpose is different in different cultures and subcultures. `` Bomb It \'\' begins by interviewing Cornbread, a Philadelphian whose campaign to label everything with his nickname in 1967 could make him the first modern graffiti artist. The film avoids the debate of who did the former, but follows the progression from simple labeling to more elaborate lyrics that led to the transformation of graffiti from a lower class counterculture movement to one that encompasses a broader artistic movement. New York graffiti artists in the seventies and eighties talk about their exploits before the city began aggressively cleaning up graffiti on public property. Other cities whose artists present themselves are: Paris, France; Amsterdam, The Netherlands; London, United Kingdom ; Berlin Germany ; Barcelona, \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bSpain; Cape Town, South Africa; S\xc3\xa3o Paulo, Brazil; Tokyo Japan ; and Los Angeles, USA UU I have always thought of graffiti as a means of frustrated, energetic, but mostly irresponsible youth, attacking what they perceive as the status quo. Now I learned that graffiti has a different meaning in different cultures. In South Africa, graffiti was a tool for political change. In Los Angeles, he has been part of the Chicano movement and has adopted the trap of a lifestyle in some neighborhoods. In some cultures, the emphasis is more on placing works of art in public spaces than in countercultures. It is not surprising that these artists have a less conflictive relationship with communities and the law. The fact is that graffiti and vandalism have a profound effect on the rate of more serious crimes. And many of the artists interviewed consider themselves extremely important people who inflict their fright on others because their lives are not what they would like. On the other hand, it can not be denied that graffiti is sometimes an improvement over monotonous and decaying buildings, or that artists are talented, or that some of the graffiti opponents are politically Philistine. `` Bomb It \'\' provides an introduction to graffiti and its controversies by showing us art, ideas and differences of opinion. The DVD (Docurama 2008): there are 3 functions and a comment. In `` Behind the Scenes \'\' (14 min), the director Jon Reiss talks about the genesis of the project, the shooting in different nations, the editing of the film and some themes. `` Long time lapse sequences \'\' (15 min) are 3 sequences, 5 minutes each in England, Brazil and Japan, where we can see the creation of the artwork in accelerated time. There are also ""Extended interviews"" (26 min). The audio commentary of director Jon Reiss and producer Tracy Wares is constant and informative. They talk about what they did and did not include in the film, their intentions and more details about who and what we are seeing.'",1
"b""Well, if you have not seen this, something great awaits you. This is one of the funniest movies ever made, certainly abbot and costello, and that's no small thing. But he also has Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney Jr., both in the roles that made them famous, and both playing totally direct, which is one of the things that makes it so classic. This is the original classic that has inspired HUNDREDS of imitations, from Bowery Boys to scooby-doo. This is terror / comedy in its heyday: you can not do better. It is a fact that the legendary rock guitarist, Jerry Garcia, considered that this was his favorite movie of all time (seriously) and for very good reasons.

So the main character is receiving phone calls and receives messages in his machine of people at random, begging for his help, since a psychopath has a weapon in the head of the victims ... which leads him to be the suspect # 1, and you have to try to solve it to prove your innocence.

Their antics were not only extended by ALL magazine covers, but even reached the national news every night! Nor is it necessary to be a genius to discover that half of the things in those magazines did not seem entirely correct. Finally Britney shows us a little of what it is like to be the most famous celebrity in the world. Some critics say that it does not really explain everything (why did he shave his head exactly? How did this person take control of his life?) He touches almost all the highlights, but the poor girl's life is public enough? Can we at least allow her to keep SOME secrets to herself? You're probably a Britney fan if you're watching this, so I doubt I should convince you that their music is amazing.

You only get a dance routine, which is divided into four parts. I expected some fun dance music (similar to the cheerleading performance), and it was a techno-like clue I took along. I also found that some of the girls' voices were particularly annoying. I did not feel energized or that I burned calories. In general, this product was a big disappointment to me.""",0

Who in their right mind does not put the mother in quarantine with at least one guard at the door and much less a nurse or technician to watch over her? ? ? ? ? ? Instead, the installation was deserted. It was too simple for the father to access her with a pass card or not. If it is still found that a person is alive 28 weeks later without symptoms in a quarantined area in the real world, that person would be locked up and monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, if not weeks, because they want to know how she survived and how she was ""immune"" to this virus. Those precautions would never be taken so lightly, especially when it comes to a virus that almost annihilates an entire country! If they did not have strict protocols, we would have disappeared as a race a long time ago. The suspension of disbelief in this movie really prevented me from enjoying a fairly well made movie.'",0
"b""This film is essential, one that you can watch at least once a year. It is entertaining with excellent performances by Sig Weaver and Melanie Griffith. Even though Melanie is a very average actor, her style works in this movie. The type of character required is to say. Blonde ditzy, it meant she could really be herself. In addition to that, your baby voice works for the role. Working Girl is a beaut comedy focused on an improbable rise to the top, but when you think about it carefully, it shows that anyone can get where he wants to be, if he has the determination and the guts. This is a good message to convey, I think. Working girl could have turned Melanie into a big star, but she did not open the doors as she thought. She may have gotten more papers after this, but none of them were worth seeing! I mean failures like Bonfire Vanities, Stormy Monday (plain urgh!), Shining Through, and one with my ex-husband Don Johnson - the title escapes me.

No pop-up menu, no real selection of features and a video transfer that would be acceptable on an economical DVD, but not in 1080p. The director's introduction looks like a worn VHS tape.

"b'... first, I was looking for a DVD that would give me useful instructions on how to perform certain poses to finally reduce my neck / shoulder pain. I can not find words like ""grind your body on Earth"" and ""throw your shoulder blades into your heart"", very useful to make sure I\'m doing the poses correctly. Maybe this DVD is intended for people with yoga training (in which case, it would probably have chosen a slightly different title, since the current one has a good chance of attracting anyone looking for solutions for neck / shoulder pain in Amazon). ) Secondly, and this was the straw that broke the proverbial camel for me, the instructor and his handsome male companion went into deep squats ... and anyone who has been instructed to do squats knows what the following means: knees of the male moved on the floor * before * the toes of his feet.

The audio problems were not simply a matter of recording, but also of the musical performance itself. The orchestra, the band or whatever it was that provided accompaniment was not identified, for good reason. Instead of giving this DVD five stars with a warning about inconveniences, I think it is more accurate to award two stars with the rating that those interested in performances with ""historical value"" can qualify it higher.'",0
"b'The third season had new directors and new writers. Only one episode was written by a writer who returned. This seems to have completely changed the tone of the show. The seasons one and two are science fiction, the third season seems more like Gilligan\'s Island or Lost in Space.

The third season features Medusa, a caveman, The Flying Dutchman, The Abominable Snowman, a spitting dinosaur fire, a two-headed dinosaur and a beetle whose bite makes you evil. Logic, continuity and characterization all go out the window. They speak Sleestak and Chaka, Enik does stupid things in the name of ""logic"". The only thing better this season is the performance.

"b""After being disappointed by Spirited Killer, I set my expectations much lower for this movie. Unfortunately, it's even worse than Spirited Killer. The story is not worth reviewing. Basically, there's a guy who knows where a valuable stone is. An evil general and his men want the stone and are trying to get it. There is also a group of good guys trying to find the guy who knows where the stone is. That is the history. Tony Jaa plays one of the bad guys and looks great in his 2 fight scenes, but all the other fights are really bad. Some of the stunts are good, but not on par with most of Panna Rittikrai's other films. The good ones have a person of the Rambo type on their side and he drag the film because his movements are very slow. But, in general, the main reason why this movie is so bad is because there are not many fights. I can handle a bad story as long as the fights are good, but this movie does not provide that. Even the grand finale is not worth staying. There are some decent explosions, but there's nothing to get excited about. Classification: 1/5. This movie really makes you appreciate how much effort you put into Panna's 2 films Born to Fight. The quality of the images is surprisingly good (well, good for Videoasia). There is a HORRIBLE dubbing track in English, but fortunately there is also a track and subtitles in the original language. The only reason why this two-disc DVD gets more than a 1-star rating is because of the special features. Minute interview with Tony Jaa. about Tom Yum Goong. There's no new information here, but as he talks, they show a really cool demo he did on a television show. 6-minute interview with Jaa talking about his inspiration to enter movies and some other interesting topics. 10-minute interview on Thai comedies TV show with Prachya Pinkaew, Jaa, Panna and Petchtai Wongkamlao. Entertaining demonstration and 5 minute interview that Jaa did in Hong Kong. Here there are good things, but nothing that you have not seen before if you are a fan of Jaa. 22-minute interview with the producer of Pechpanna Films and a director / actor of the company. Awesome interview! They talk about great things, like a new Thai movie called The Brave. It's not subtitled and the dubbing is really cheesy, but that actually makes it more enjoyable (at least for me). And there are some good action scenes mixed in the interview. Tony Jaa interview It seems that they are just trying to accumulate the special features with this. The only thing to talk about is a 1 minute demo that they show at the end of the interview. Finally, an interview with Christoph Kluppel, a great German Rambo starring Battle Warrior. He talks about his film career. I guess this would be interesting if I were a fan of him.""",0

GREGORY PECK offers a great performance, strong and also vulnerable at the end. Considering that this movie was made in 1949, it is definitely a classic. If you love war movies with a lot of action, a girls' ornementation and a HOLLYWOOD vision, you do not see this movie, it's just beyond you.""",1
"b""The 1922 `` Prisoner of Zenda '' is surely one of the best silent films ever made. His main actors knew that they should not over-thrill and obviously had a very competent director in Rex Ingram. Although the plot, the costumes and the stage are taken from an operetta, the players mostly come out as natural, showing that good acting was not something that somehow arose with the advent of sound. Even Ram\xc3\xb3n Navarro as the villain Rupert of Hentzau shows himself as something more than a pretty face while turning his role into a fun and animated tour de force. The image begins in the manor of the Englishman Rudolph Rassendyll, the camera focused on the extremely beautiful eyes of Lewis Stone, now a 43-year veteran who, in most other respects, looks like a fairly ordinary middle-aged man and with a good physical condition. But, of course, there's nothing ordinary in Stone's histrionic talent and, in addition, it has all the charm that made him as beloved as Judge Hardy some 15 years later in the series `` Andy Hardy ''. Rassendyll decides to attend the coronation of his cousin, Rudolph of Ruritania, [whose twin could be] and discovers that his relative is a dissipated disaster. Lewis Stone plays both sides, needless to say. The future weak king has an ambitious but evil brother, Duke Michael, who conspires to seize the throne and kill Rudolph in the process. On the eve of the coronation, the duke arranges for his brother to be drugged so that he will not be able to attend the ceremony. Therefore, the king's loyalists persuade the British Rassendyll to take his place for a day and prevent Michael from getting away with it. The Ruritarian Rudolph has a beautiful fiancee played by the luminous Alice Terry. The couple does not have much use for each other, but she is a popular princess that would serve to reinforce the unstable position of Rudolph. However, Rassendyll and the lovely girl are taken at once and, feeling an unexpected change in their intention, the princess no longer sees her role as future queen as a mere duty. Of course, the plot is complicated and there is another woman involved, played by the seductive but less natural actress, Barbara La Marr. Rudolph Rassendyll can not return to his home in England after the coronation, but must remain to help rescue his real cousin in danger of extinction. There are also a lot of skulls and a game of swords. They are all a fascinating movie and it is a true revelation to see how effective the younger Judge Hardy's younger version is in love scenes. Pretty sexy! It is probably not accidental that the actor who played the double role in the next `` Prisoner of Zenda '', Ronald Colman, looked a lot like Lewis Stone.""",1
"b'I remember it like it was yesterday . I was 24 years old when this movie came out and I lived in Miami, Florida. He had long hair (very long) and was coming out with an absolute bonbon. So the weekend that this movie came out dragged me to this movie my girlfriend. Actually, it was a group of us, three couples and all the boys were dragged by their friends. The 24-year-old long-haired boys in heavy metal music are not the type to enjoy a girl movie, so none of us was excited to be there. In order to make the film a little more pleasant, we are in a slightly ""altered"" state. ""But this little movie won us out, and none of us was single at that time either, I also really interacted with the Matt Dillon character because that is how I was living my life at that moment, I can not add anything other than what others have said, since the movie works very well because it is not corny, it is not forced, it is not clich\xc3\xa9, and it is not corny There was something so honest and natural in the film, and even though at that moment it was really Angry at the advent of the grunge music that killed the precious heavy metal that I loved so much, I ended up enjoying the music as well.This was a true grunge, before the music companies turned grunge into the commercialized trash of the top 40, and before the designers / clothing manufacturers turned the clothes of the second-hand store into extremely expensive high-end designer clothes, it really sparked my interest in Seattle and I remember wanting to move her for a few years after watching this movie (she never did). As my title says, this is a movie for girls even the boys will like, as it escapes all the classic ornaments of the typical movie of girls The acting and writing are first class, as is music and the city of Seattle. Since then, I\'ve seen the film in an unaltered state and it has not lost any of its charm, originality and innocence. This movie captures a period of time that was very fun, innocent, carefree, fresh and exciting, before the dot-com bubble, before 9/11, before record gas high prices, and before the implosion of all our economy. Not only do the 20 people of today do not have a movie like Singles that they can call their own, nor do they have much future to expect.'",1
"b'An aged stripper exerts great powers over others with the help of a mysterious amulet in SIN, YOU SINNERS. The word ""aging"" seems a kind way to express it. It seems that Mama\'s 30-year contract in midlife is about to expire soon, although that does not seem to threaten her control over manager Dave and her daughter. Nor, the saints preserve us, does not stop her from squeaking and hitting every 15 minutes or so? Dave, the doll bought and paid for by Mom, is her manager and bongo drums accompanist when she makes her second job as a spiritualist who waves amulets and who specializes in cheating the rich. Dave is also crazy about his daughter, and the 20-something daughter is crazy about Dave, but she can not bleed a hormone while Mom uses the amulet. Even though mommy, the saints preserve us, she starts shaking and shaking in her little bikini with the bangs on top, this is not really a blue film. Beyond the horrible, I do not know what it is or how to explain it. The second howler on this DVD, the reason why I picked it up in the first place, is the vehicle with a script and starring Lenny Bruce (the only real movie he was in) DANCE HALL RACKET. It is a dance hall that deceives its client and the dancers in the corridor who cheat the management. Bruce is revered by stand-up comedians as an avant-garde genius, current and pioneer of the first order. That may be all, but his first accredited scripting movie does not confirm it. Do not get up, do not joke, do not ha-ha in this. Stinks . It does not help that the impression of the transfer was in very bad condition, and sometime between 1953 and today someone cut all the brief nude shots in the girls\' dressing room. Losing quick glances is no big deal, but it messes up the soundtrack and the dialogue and makes some conversations even more ridiculous than I imagine they would be otherwise. Two stenches for the price of one. It is not recommended as entertainment, although this is probably the best chance to see a Lenny Bruce who walks and talks. If that does not do it for you, avoid this DVD like the plague.'",0
"b""Adam Sandler presents a great performance in this follow up of `` Magnolia '' by director Paul Thomas Anderson. Emily Watson is equally good. Adam plays Barry Egan, a man with seven sisters who feels careless, depressed and loveless ... until he comes across one of his sister's good friends. Little by little, they develop a relationship and begin to leave. Meanwhile, Barry is in a quandary with a group of sex telephone operators. All this leads to a beautiful ending in the best movie I've seen all year. I will be the owner of this DVD. I recommend this movie!""",1
"b'While ""Singin \'in the Rain"" of 1952 is definitely the most accomplished musical film, I believe that this 1949 classic optimist is the best example of what MGM produced during the golden age of Hollywood when talents were at their peak. Co-directed by Gene Kelly and 25-year-old Stanley Donen in his film directorial debut, the film has a constant power of propulsion thanks mostly to the extraordinary choreography of Kelly and Donen, the perfect blend of Leonard Bernstein\'s family music with Oboe studio Roger Edens\' original compositions, and the sheer effervescence of the performers.Written by the estimable team of Betty Comden and Adolph Green, the threadbare plot is simply about three sailors - Gabey, Chip and Ozzie - on a 24-hour permit in New York and women who know and romance. Based on a subway poster, womanizer Gabey falls in love with Miss Turnstiles and spends her time looking for her. Ozzie, assailed by the phobia, finds romance with the anthropology student Claire, while the shy Chip focuses on sightseeing despite the persistent attention of the aggressive taxi driver Hildy. The closest thing to dramatic tension lies in the deceptions of Miss Turnstiles, who is not the big celebrity that Gabey assumes is an aspiring dancer named Ivy, who has to work at night as an exotic dancer in Coney Island. It is obviously at its best when it focuses on the musical sequences, starting with the actual locations used by `` New York, New York \'\' to establish the energetic arrival of the sailors, continuing the elaborate number \'\' Prehistoric Man \'\' . at the Natural History Museum and bouncing through the whole melody of the title with the six directors singing and dancing from the Empire State Building. Everyone has the opportunity to shine, although like Gabey, Gene Kelly clearly dominates with his athletic agility. Like Chip, an eclipsed Frank Sinatra gets mainly to sing to Betty Garrett, who admirably contains his brassiness as Hildy. Although Hardly Credible as an academic type, Ann Miller gets to play impressively during the ""Prehistoric Man"", and the Rubber with Jules Munshin\'s face provides greater comedy relief as Ozzie. When she dances instead of acting to fool Gabey, Vera-Ellen dazzles as Ivy, from the whimsical ""Miss Turnstiles Ballet,"" to her superb duos with Kelly on ""Main Street"" and ""A Day in New York Ballet."" \' The only sour note is the condescending attitude towards Hildy\'s shrill, shrilly floormate, Lucy (played enthusiastically by the original Gladys Kravitz of `` Bewitched \'\', Alice Pearce). Harold Rosson\'s color-saturated cinematography has held up pretty well in the transfer of print on the 2000 DVD, although the only extra is the now battered theater trailer.'",1
"b""My children love this movie and see it in their dreams with their friends. Don Knotts plays Luther Hegg, a shy typo in a small town in the Midwest (Rachel, Kansas). The supporting actors are first class: Skip Homeier, Dick Sargent, Ellen Corby, etc. Joan Staley, who plays Alma, was the PLAYBOY home page in 1958! Vivian Vance's ex-husband Phil Ober plays the killer and the old ladies at the boarding house are hilarious. Reta Shaw is very funny since the director of the Psychic Society and the musical score of Vic Muzzy is cornily chilling. When this image premiered for the first time in theaters in l965, it was a great success in the small cities of the United States and is very representative of the small American city of 1960.

Do not buy this DVD from this particular company. Amazon should really eliminate it because it badly reflects its reputation. I would not have given it a star, but the website requires it.'",0
"b'My expectation for this movie was that it would be more or less a compilation and reinforcement of the information I had obtained from seeing the movie `` Fast Food Nation \'\' several years ago, and that I had just read the excellent books `` Animal, Vegetable Miracle \'\' and `` In Defense of Food \'\' among others. However, this movie is more than the sum of those books and that movie. Food Inc. is an extremely well-made documentary, partly because of the personal stories told by the interviewees, as well as the hidden images of the camera. I was especially impressed by what is happening to farmers. The material is so well researched and presented. Multiple aspects of the production, marketing and consumption of food are covered. There is no ""waiting time"" in this movie, it\'s success after success. All the impressive and important information that citizens need to be worried about. Congratulations to all those involved in the making of this incredibly important film. Thanks to those who dared to tell the truth. Yes, it is disturbing, but you must look at it.'",1
"b""This revision is for the edition of the Criterion COllection DVD of the film. The original French title of the film is & quot; Du Rifiif Chez les Hommes & quot; which is translated to & quot; Problems with men & quot; The movie is really good and it's about several men who plan to break into a jewelry store, open the safe and escape, all without triggering the alarm. Several of the scenes have been imitated in other films: notably Mission Impossible and the remake of Italain Job. Many scenes are quite exciting and the shooting scene is very exciting. This half-hour scene also does not contain any dialogue, so it is one of the longest, if not the longest, without dialogue in a movie with dialogue. This is definitely one of the best filming movies I've seen and it's certainly worthy of a release from the Criterion Collection. There are also several special features. There is a theatrical trailer, stills and production notes, a video interview with the director, Jules Dassin, who also personally appropriated this edition, and drawings of Alexandre Trauner's sets. There is also an optional soundtrack in English for those who are disturbed by foreign languages \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bwith subtitles. Either way, this is a movie that no fan of theft movies should miss.""",1
"b'This is a mysterious, spooky and dark film in which the writer did not get too far with the plot. Often in films like this, writers make the mysterious solution incredibly complicated and unrealistic. This film, on the other hand, is complex enough to be intriguing, while still having a high score on the realism index. As much as I liked this movie, I will say that Sean Connery is one of the main reasons. Without it, the movie would probably lose a star. This is one of his best performances. F. Murray Abraham is also at his best, as the incredibly evil inquisitor. Christian Slater is not bad. The other actors in the film seem to have been found in a traveling phenomena show or had the best makeup artist of all time. What a strange group! The film does not exaggerate the blood and represents very little violence. Torture and murder generally occur off the screen. The Catholic church definitely has a purple eye here. All monks and clergy (apart from Sean C.) are listed as at least 3 of the following: evil, ullage, sexually active (heterosexual and homosexual) and generally very foolish. However, I like to think that much of that is due to the century (14) when the mystery occurs, and therefore things were much more primitive. Even so, Catholics may be offended if they are not already numbed by every other movie that presents the Catholic clergy. The mystery itself is good and should keep you guessing. Sean Connery is the only logical person in the movie, and he is your tour guide for the solution. I enjoyed the movie, as I think most will. Only manage your expectations, since this is a good movie, but not one of the best.'",1

It is simply beautiful. The whole movie is also excellent, but the last scene before the final number in the real fasion of Lana Turner steals the film. In this scene, she is fatally ill and leaves the theare while Tony Martin sings: ""You came out of a dream. \'\' In her prank profession at the top of the stairwell without any dialogue, just music, she thinks of Be that beautiful Ziegfield girl again and come down the stairs.The music develops and then she collapses.Oh, what a dramatic scene.This whole movie will make your heart beat and you just wish Hollywood could produce something like this again.'",1

"b'`` Elvis: that\'s how it is \'\' captures King Presley at an interesting crossroads in his career. With his true talents largely wasted after too many years in Hollywood, Elvis was usurped as the ""King of Rock and Roll"" by people like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. This documentary, filmed in the summer of 1970 while preparing for a commitment at the International Hotel in Las Vegas, finds Elvis ready and in the best condition to regain his throne! The documentary shows him at age 35, fit and fit, and he has a lot of fun! Seeing Elvis having fun, that in itself is a joy! Elvis had a good sense of muscianship and his craft. I expected a lot from the people I worked with; and he knew exactly how to get the best out of everyone. Here it is obvious that Elvis loved to work with his band and backup singers; and they loved working with him. Elvis gave criticism in a smooth and funny way. When his band struggles with the middle section of `` Bridge Over Troubled Water \'\', Elvis comments: `` If it goes that way, it goes that way, but we do not have to emphasize it. ""The footage of the concert itself shows that it is very possible that Elvis was the most hard-working man in the world of entertainment. It also proves that Elvis had `` that \'\' - that undefinable X Factor, often indecipherable (or in his case, factors) that marks the difference between an artist and a superstar. Elvis was a superstar with a capital ""S"", who possesses a powerful combination of charisma, sexual attractiveness, musical expertise and talent for the show. Elvis\' charisma, in particular, burns the stage quite a bit. Elvis does everything he can to please his audience. During a long performance of ""Love Me Tender"", he comes out to the audience, kissing so many women and shaking hands with as many men as possible.

As the final credits advance, we see Elvis greeting celebrities after the performance. Sammy Davis, Jr., clearly amazed, comments: ""Man, you have revealed yourself and you have never stopped!"" When congratulated on a wonderful show, Elvis responds modestly: ""Well, it was a sweaty spectacle. \'\' The special edition DVD includes two versions, but continues with the most recent restored edition and omits the original 1970 theatrical version.

When you press the MENU button on the remote control, the playback blinks for half a second. Pressing the GUIDE button on the remote control accesses a white screen that does nothing and remains blank. THE TRANSFER is horrible. It seems as if they set up a recording device to directly record on DVD a direct projection of the film on a cheap screen. There are even scratches and spots on the film and the whole screen looks blurry and distorted without being recognized. The sound is muffled as if you were in a padded cell listening through a can. The dubbing of British accents on dialogue really discourages you when you use strange phrases. The performance is non-existent. It seems as if he had been cut in a hurry and several scenes are missing. In one scene, you see Jackie Chan walking down a path in a market and moments later you cut the father of his character in the middle of an action scene as the house burns around him. The quality of the movie is less than what you would get by recording some CBS without cable. HORRIBLE RECEPTION HERE! My recommendation: DO NOT ADDRESS!""",0

"b'If you have never seen a movie, this is the one you should choose. One of the most critically acclaimed gay movies, it is a sensitive, affectionate, tender and sweet story with an excellent score by Mama Cass. The film has also been hailed as a good representation of the working class in British society. The film, directed in large part by Hettie McDonald and based on the screenplay by gay writer Jonathan Harvey, portrays the relationships of people in a large complex located in East London (he was physically there). Most of the British, working-class, low-income, the film revolves around three families, all broken houses. Ste, from a father and a family of abusive brothers; Jaime, a mother and a boyfriend\'s family; and Leah, a British black girl with her mother. The story is the development of a gay love affair between two children, Ste (played by Scott Neal) and Jaime (played by Glenn Berry). Both live side by side. Both are 16 (also in real life to maintain accuracy). It is also the story of Leah, sometimes a drug user, a problematic and abandoned teenager. She is a catalyst with her obsession with the music of Mama Cass, constantly singing her songs and making a lot of noise around the apartments. I have read messages about her in this movie chat room, without understanding why she is the movie. His character contributes to the greatness of the film. His father and brother beat him several times. He takes refuge in Jaime\'s house. Jaime\'s mother, Sandra (superbly played by Linda Henry). She loves Jaime very much and left her husband because of physical abuse. She is a tough, sensible, caring and loving woman who runs the local bar / club in this apartment complex. She feels sorry for Ste and takes it inside. Ste has to sleep in Jaime\'s bed or on a sofa. Then, one thing leads to the other, Jaime kisses Ste. There\'s a trip to a local gay bar, more kisses in the woods. Sandra discovers that her son has been lying to her about her love for Ste. She is informed by the school principal that Jaime is teased and calls him `` fagot \'\'. ""And the movie reaches its final moments."" Leah plays music by Mama Cass late at night when she is high and almost falling from the balcony of the apartment building, and Ste discovers that Sandra knows about them. While Sandra has been offered a better job managing a pub in another area of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bEast London, she says goodbye to her boyfriend and prepares to go out at night with the girls. Ste, Jaime and Leah prepare to go to the gay bar again. The final scenes of the film show Ste and Jaime dancing (with a melody of music by Mama Cass) in an open area of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bthe apartment buildings while the tenants gather to see the whole thing, some in a riot. Sandra goes to the balcony, next to Leah, looking at what was happening below. One of the best scenes I\'ve seen in a movie of any kind is the extension of Leah\'s hand to Sandra (the symbolism is so powerful). By the way, Sandra and Leah fight like cats and dogs throughout the film, they are arranged in the final moments. They both joined Ste and Jaime at the dance, and Sandra finally accepts her son\'s sexuality. This is a very powerful film and the title is very appropriate. Both Glenn and Scott have stated in interviews that they received thousands of letters after the movie asking if they were homosexual. Glenn disappeared from the screen and Scott did some minor things. The language is difficult to understand sometimes. There are websites with the dictionary of the speeches used by the working class in Great Britain. Someone put a script for a sequel on the Internet, it\'s pretty good. This is a `` BIG \'\' movie'",1
"b'They do not do it that way anymore. This is really sordid. In fact, sex far exceeds violence. And the many sex scenes are pretty graphic, almost touching the hardcore. It is also unpleasant, especially in the scene of the massage room, where a sadist hits a woman with her belt. A scream in the streets revolves around the fight of two policemen against the criminal scum: thieves, a tom peeping and a serial killer, which looks HORRIBLE. And their female victims are not too smart, as they approach them as an unconvincing ""woman"", and they (including a simple cloth detective!) Do not even notice it! Like many police films of his time, A SCREAM ... has a position of open self-justification. Be careful with the final scene, which also makes good use of the split screen technique, which was very popular in the early 70s. As you probably have already guessed, politically it is NOT correct and that is why it is so much fun. The quality of the image is very impressive. SWV has done a great job with the transfer. As usual, the SWV DVD offers many additional features. Of course, there is the movie trailer, which includes images that are not shown in the movie. In total, there are a dozen trailers, either from the US operating rate. UU Or old French criminal movies. My personal favorite among the trailers is THE GODSON starring Uschi DIGARD (this movie will be released on DVD soon). An option to `` play everything \'\' for the trailers would have been useful. Also included are five short films, of which I liked THE PROWLER. Because I am a true crime aficionado, this black and white instructional film for police officers of the early \'60s was very convincing to me. Also interesting is CRIME IN THE STREET, an instructive documentary on crime prevention that features a very young Chuck NORRIS (then coach of karate). The film is entertaining but in some way useless, because all the advice given is well known and common sense. I did not like the other three shorts very much. HARRY NOVAK, CRIME BUSTER is a kind of documentary in which a film crew visits the film producer Harry NOVAK. After cheating NOVAK (in jest) he suggests that he visit a business partner, who paid with a dirty check. NOVAK brandishes a samurai sword and a rifle to improve his arguments. Strange commercial habits ... Another short film is an extremely silly sex movie, boring beyond belief and due to a horrible quality of printing almost impossible to see. The last short feature is a black and white burlesque striptease. Bored, and by the way: you can not see something. The best is the extensive Harry NOVAK movie gallery. Buy the DVD, but better omit the last three shorts in the additional features.'",1
"b'I bought this thinking that I would receive a delivery from one of my childhood favorites, Hollywood and the Stars. This is not everything. (Oh, the dangers of online shopping ...) This disc contains three episodes (called `` episodes \'\') consisting of news footage related to World War II, but the similarity with Hollywood and the stars ends there . Instead of the narration of the inimitable Joseph Cotten, Eric Sevareid offers us occasional comments. Of course, Mr. Sevareid is a legend among journalists, but he does not cut himself off if Joseph Cotten is expected (not to mention the beautiful theme music of Elmer Bernstein). If you have to buy this, do it at your own risk and because your content that is not ""Hollywood and the Stars"" is of interest to you, and not from the list (I got it pretty cheap from a third-party Amazon seller, but any loss of money is painful to me).

"b'`` Lost Highway \'\' is not so linear and, therefore, satisfies our narrative desire, like `` Mulholland Drive \'\' because, in fact, it seems to try too hard to be weird. But David Lynch is one of the only directors who understands how strange dream cinema can be. Like Hitchcock, exploits this situation with all its value, but in the manner of the classical surrealists, and I think that this film can be better experienced on the stage of a real theater. The terrain of this film is even more deeply unconscious than `` Mulholland Drive \'\', because its final theme seems to be the fact of seeing a narrative film in itself, channeled through a paragon of truth in our society: photos of the crime scene. This is what makes it interesting. It is so open, however, that it allows each viewer his own personal interpretation, because the ""superficial plot"" is mixed with his own interpretive tracks ... My opinion is that Fred Madison believes he was convicted of murdering his wife in base to the images contained in the last videotape delivered to him and to Renee (Patricia Arquette); during the first act, the most crucial line is his statement that he does not like cameras because he prefers to remember things his way, ""not necessarily the way they happened"". ""This whole first section of the movie is the way Fred remembers his life before being imprisoned, and it takes place in the space of a second, after the police officer who stops him punches him in the He believes in the mysterious tapes that preceded the murder is his way of trying to convince himself that he did not, that the Man of Mystery (Robert Blake as wifekiller - ironic, huh?) He really did. Part, less effective due to its lighter tone, is the way Madison escapes from the reality of the electric chair.The light on his cell flickers and buzzes as presumably someone is being executed, which triggers his fantasy of escaping by physically becoming In another person, however, even in the life of this younger man, Renee returns (as a double ...?) and he is free to start a life with her without the memory of his marriage, but he finds out about the sordid truth about s u life ... Mystery Man reappears, this time helping him commit a conscious murder of his ex-pimp, and allowing him to videotape himself to convince himself that this murder (which Fred may have committed before the movie began) It was right. But who the hell knows ... The plot? I mapped this movie after I saw it for the first time, and there are too many doubles whose nature we, as spectators, can not trust either as a physical reality or as a mental projection. Each interpretation points to the other, such as the Moebius strip that Lynch claims to embody the film. It is more like a puzzle structured around themes, mainly a subtext that involves photography: the photo of the twins, the pornographic films, the horrifying video tapes that appear on their doors as evil calling cards. Make sure you get a mailbox version of this movie; Lynch\'s visual compositions are based on horizontal angles everywhere, and there are many extreme close-ups in which the top of the heads are truncated (I\'m sure they are bad intentions). The cinematography is great, and the soundtrack (not the music, but the atmosphere that Lynch always does meticulously) is as important as the images, as in `` Eraserhead. `` And after watching a particular scene in this movie, you\'ll be very careful with the crystal tables with sharp edges for the rest of your life ...'",1
"b'Yes, my first copy had the audio problem, but the replacement worked fine, so do not be afraid to buy this good introduction to an overlooked horror star. In his very theatrical way, Tod Slaughter was as nice as Karloff or Lugosi, and, as some critics have noted, no actor had so much fun being Bad (with a capital B)! FACE is probably the best and BARN is the first; Both films are eminently observable with good image quality. Then, give Horror Man of Europe a chance; If you love the scary movies of the 30s and 40s, you probably will not regret it. I, for my part, hope to see more Slaughter on DVD.'",1

The funny parts were not so funny ... and I think they could have picked a better loser than Brendan Fraser ... although I think Liz Hurley played her role for a T ...

"b'By the time this album came out, the Spice Girls were everywhere. They were on all magazine covers, they carried lollipops, books, even had several series of dolls and 5 hits # 1. This album was only added and to this day has sold more than 15 million copies worldwide. Accept it, they sold more albums than anybody since the Beatles and nobody still has to sell more than the Spice Girls did. They are a milestone in pop music, a legacy and without them, there would be no Britney or Christina.01. Spice Up Your Life (10/10) Another hit # 1 for girls, this song has great lyrics. And it was an intelligent way to market them. I was impressed with the video, it\'s very good. Great song.02. Stop (10/10) The song that did not reach # 1 in the United Kingdom. I love this . The voices of Geri are in my opinion the best part of this song. She sounds so sweet and perfect in her verses. Catchy lyrics ... a perfect pop song.03. Too much (10/10) One of my favorite songs of all time. Like 2 Become 1. I love the message and the story behind it. When you have it, it\'s too much ... when you do not have it, it\'s not enough. Song lyrics by GREAT.04. Saturday Night Divas (10/10) Another one of my favorites. I love the part of Melanie C on the bridge. Your voice here surprises me. Emma\'s verses are also perfect. Beautiful song with original and different verses. Love it ! 05. Never give up in good times (10/10) Many fans agree that this would have been a great single. This is a great song with a great message for everyone. Especially the girls. Stay safe and do not get pregnant ... live young while you can. Move to Over (8/10) The Pepsi song, but in general it\'s great. A kind of filler in this album, but its smooth rhythm and raw voices make up for it. Although I prefer Pepsi\'s other song `` Step To Me \'\' about it. It is available in the Japanese version of this album.07. Do it (9/10) Another song with a great message! My mother did not believe it when this album came out, but I agreed with everything they say and I still do. `` The rules are meant to be broken, do what suites, not what they want you to do. \'\' 08. Deny (10/10) It reminds me of my ex-boyfriend denying that he was really gay. This is one of my favorites . `` You are not foolish but yourself. \'\' So true.09. Viva Forever (10/10) Wonderful! Beautiful lyrics and melody. Saying goodbye to true love ... I can relate to this deeper than many other songs here. This song really gives me chills, it\'s a disturbing song. One of his best.10. The Lady Is A Vamp (7/10) It is not one of my favorites, but it IS different. And it\'s a great way to end the album as a concert ... \'\' Ladies and gentlemen, we hope you enjoyed the show! ""In general, this album is as good as the original with as much spice as the previous one - Geri, Emma, \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bMel C, Mel B & Victoria have the same voice in this case and they all sound amazing anyway. This album is probably my favorite of the three, and I LOVE all three, so if you still do not have it, buy it or something like that It\'s fun It makes you dance, cry and think a lot It\'s not just a soundtrack, this is a ALBUM.

She sings impeccably and is one of the best Liu I've heard.3. Turandot ... Eva Marton might not be the best Turandot, but that does not matter. When she and Domingo sang in act III it was magic. When she was shedding tears as she sang, my heart pounded with a renewed passion for why I loved the Opera to begin with. My eyes and ears were glued to my home theater. As far as I know, Marton and Domingo could have deciphered their voices and I would not have minded a bit, because people were related to the stars that night.

"b'OK ; Let\'s be clear about something. This is a work of fiction. It is well crafted, slippery and tempting in its message. But it is fiction. However, let\'s also be clear on some other things. First, many of the points that are made here are TRUE. Which ? Well, I\'ll avoid spoilers, but suffice it to say that people often ask me if I\'m an atheist. No, I say, I do not deny the possibility of a superior being. But I deny the church. This story clearly shows how organized religion has routinely destroyed the best messages, but corrupting them with greed, cravings for power and cruelty. Groups of men made human decisions and wrote human words to describe a system that would keep them in power, and this story delves into that. It delves into the little-known facts surrounding the so-called ""holy"" bible ... the idea that what we know as today\'s bible differs greatly from what it once was. And so . I do not seek to destroy the faith, nor this history. What it does is, hopefully, tempt the viewer / reader to THINK for HIMSELF. This is a fun, well-acted and well-photographed story of a well-written and enjoyable modern fiction.

"b""`` Battlefield Earth '' is considered one of the WORST movies ever made. It makes `` Hands, Hands of Fate '' look like a profound, human and moving drama about suffering in the hands of a cult and `` Plan 9 from outer space '' seems like a profound meditation on world peace and the dangers of science `` Battlefield '' has holes in plots bigger than Swiss cheese, and to think that it was a labor of love (!!!) John Travolta saw this film as a tribute to L. Ron Hubbard. But it ended a catastrophic failure. And no wonder. `` Battlefield '' has human beings living in primitive conditions, at the mercy of the dreadlocked psychics led by John Travolta and Forest Whitaker. Human civilization lies in ruins. The special effects, sometimes, especially with the ruins, are convincing. Pity about the rest of the movie. Barry Pepper (who seems to have retired, or something like that) stars as the hero, '' Jonny Goodboy. '' Not inventing that. Being a prisoner of the Psychlos, he manages to learn to read, fly planes, fire guns, all in a remarkably short period of time. As for the psychos, what was their motivation in world domination?

Silent premise, horrible acting, a horrible makeup scene between Travolta and his real life wife, Kelly Preston ... it's better not to see her.

At least, her taste for camp movies has not changed, as she acted as the mother of Tracy Turnblatt in Hairspray (Full Screen Edition). The love of bad movies is a battlefield.""",0

"b'Every year, when Christmas arrives, I like to invite some friends to enjoy a drink of joy (the powerful recipe of Egg Nog is available on request), put on some good Christmas music, light candles, prepare delicious douves and gather around me. Humble but enough cinema and see a wonderful holiday favorite. This year I\'m going to see Die Hard and for me Christmas would not be complete without him. The classic story of John McTiernan (Predator and The Hunt for Red October) that spawned three explosive sequels never seems to age. , no matter how old-fashioned the hair, clothing and image of cocaine addicts in California. Die Hard follows John McClane (Bruce Willis) to the Christmas party of his quasi-wife (Bonnie Bedelia) in a skyscraper on the west coast. He is a New York policeman whose wife and children moved west while taking a great opportunity and adapting. Obviously, they are having some marriage problems, but it is minimized enough. The building is empty, with the exception of the group that is celebrating the Christmas party on one of the highest floors. `` Terrorists \'\' led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) take over the building and chaos ensues. Gruber\'s plan would have gone well if John had not escaped and slowly began to eliminate each of his henchmen, while informing the local authorities. The federals soon enter and the film explodes in an action classic ... and also in a Christmas classic. Maybe he has a hero as nice and convincing as John McClane and Bruce Willis surpasses any other action hero by making John not only smart and funny, but also easy to relate to very little drama. It\'s an effortless performance that I can only compare to Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. Only a few intrepid observations along with a cynical look on his face make John go from being a typical good guy to what every boy dreams he could become in these circumstances. It\'s fantastic and it\'s corny, but that\'s forgivable because it\'s a holiday movie and, most importantly, the action remains the priority at Die Hard. On the other side of the coin, the greatness of Die Hard is completed by his formidable and accessible antagonist, Hans Gruber. Even after we discover that Hans is not there as a political terrorist, but simply as a thief, he does not lose the credibility of the villains at all when he responds to the criticisms of Holly McClane by saying: ""I am an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane and since I am moving to kidnapping you should be more educated. ""Although we know that Hans is capable of vile acts, he actually sees them as merely means to a greater and somehow justifiable end."" His disposition is almost humanitarian and you would imagine him as A gentleman out of the context of the crimes he commits in the Die Hard arc In the end, however, Hans is a pure sociopath with whom even the public feels sympathetic, I would have liked him to escape if his opposition was Van Damme, Segal or Stallone ... maybe even Arnold, the cast of support is another great strength and it helps to highlight the humorous background of the film. Fun and rich sonajes, especially Reggie VelJohnson as Los Angeles police sergeant Al Powell. The villains are purely chaotic thugs with enough variety to be a little more than just the count of John\'s bodies. It is also worth noting the performance of William Atherton as a reporter, as is the limo driver of John, Argyle. It is even worthwhile to enjoy the edited versions for television where the oath is replaced by wonderfully clear little curses like * ditch slug *, * melon farmer * and * bad mother cruncher *. Those of course make it fun and accessible for all ages and Die Hard is one of the best examples of hilariously edited television movies. But that, of course, is not what makes it a great movie. In fact, I would say that Die Hard is the best pure action movie ever made. Yippie-ki-yay * muddy braggart * and happy holidays.'",1
"b'Putting in my two cents: The girl who jumped through time has been on my watch list for a while, but I never took the time to check it until yesterday. I (like most other critics) did not expect too much, but after watching his new movie ""Summer Wars"", I decided to try it. I must say that despite being a slightly older film, this exceeds Summer Wars in almost every respect (except perhaps in computer animation). There are literally no weaknesses in this movie. The quality of the animation is still high in everything. The characters are beautifully hand-drawn and the backgrounds are very elaborate (most of them drawn by hand too). The use of computer animation is kept to a minimum and occurs mainly when we see a \'jump\'. The characters are strong and nice. Makoto is your typical clumsy teenager. A casual encounter followed by an (almost) horrible accident allows you to \'jump\' in time. Instead of using this ability for the so-called ""evil"" (it would be receding and investing heavily in certain populations ...), Makoto uses the ability to improve his life and that of his friends. However, this begins to cause unforeseen and terrible circumstances. And this is the point where the film goes from being cheerful and somewhat comical to totally dramatic and sad. I will not divulge any event or ruin any plot, but let\'s say that at the end of the film I was moved (though not with teary eyes!). The performance of the Japanese voice is strong, especially considering at least 2/3 of the main characters are voiced by a voice actor for the first time. It will show how in Japan, they take the voice acting seriously and emitting well (instead of the majority of American dubbing firms that have a core of 5 or 6 full-time actors that HAVE to match a main character in each series or movie - often does not achieve the best combination for the character). So the story is strong with a little science fiction, the characters are nice and well portrayed, the voice acting is wonderful, the animation is beautiful ... why have not you seen this yet? If you\'re not an anime fan, this could be a good movie to help you change your mind.'",1

"b'What I liked most about this movie is its lack of & quot; message & quot; or agenda After telling a great story, this movie had nothing to do with & quot; try & quot; . There were no tearful speeches for AIDS victims, there is no anguish for the pain of leaving, just great characters dedicated to a fun and unconventional script (with a dialouge as good as any of Neal Simon) that works. There are many complicated plot elements that combine very well and that is not easy to do. The way in which the writer links the main characters with the struggle to finish his song with the rest of the plot is brilliant. I also disagree with the criticism of a previous writer who claimed that the two characters had no chemistry and would never be together in & quot; reality & quot; . One could see by the admirable performance of J.P. Pitoks that the character was more than just a meatloaf. In fact, I thought they made a really nice and realistic couple despite, but DUE to their differences. The final scene of them walking down the street said it all ...

"b""The classic tale of demonic possession of all time, based on the best-selling novel by William Peter Blatty. Linda Blair is Regan MacNeil, a twelve-year-old girl who is manifested by a truly malevolent spirit. His mother, Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), an agnostic, seeks the help of a young Jesuit psychiatrist, Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller, God rest his Irish soul!) Who has demons of his own and is tormented by the recent death of his mother, and his loss in faith in which he sought refuge. After facing the demon within the girl (and himself), Karras, although skeptical of demonic possession, receives permission from the church to help during the exorcism. The priest selected to perform the ritual is a mysterious and elderly Jesuit, Father Lankaster Merrin (Max Von Sydow) who has seen such a diabolical work before. While the two clerics confront the devil, a police detective, Lieutenant William F. Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb) finds some links that connect the girl to a disconcerting death and desecration in the local Catholic church. William Friedkin directed brilliantly, and Blatty adapted the script (receiving an Oscar for his efforts) and produced. The cast offers extraordinary and sensitive performances (Burstyn, Miller and Blair were nominated for the Academy Awards) and the special effects are impressive and still have an impact, with veteran actress Mercedes McCambridge giving the voice of the evil entity. (The movie also won for Best Achievement in Sound). The underlying theme of much of Blatty's work is obvious, his philosophy is, if there is all this evil out there, why is there so much good? Metaphorically, all fight against their own demons, and even in his last moment of self-sacrifice, Karras returns to find his faith and heroically gives his life to save this innocent child. How significant can it be? A truly terrifying, absorbing and ultimately moving film that deals with faith and human frailty.""",1

b'GREAT MOVIE . THE STORYLINE LINE IS POSSIBLE AND THE MUSIC WAS REALLY EXCELLENT. THIS IS ONE TO SEE IT AGAIN AND AGAIN',1
"b""This story caught my attention immediately and held throughout the film. The movie is based on the life of John Nash. He was a brilliant mathematician who became famous when he was young because of his work in economics. The film covers several decades and begins when John Nash arrives at Princeton University. Russell Crowe does an excellent job in the role of Nash. The part required Nash's transformation from a healthy young man to an aged schizophrenic. Alicia, Nash's wife, is played by Jennifer Connelly. She is very convincing as an intelligent and strong woman who realizes that her brilliant husband is very worried and lives in another world. A particular and charming scene stands out in my mind where Nash and his future wife are staring at the stars. He tells her to think in different ways or animals and that she is able to look at the night sky, with its millions of stars, and join them in any way she mentions. I wish there had been more scenes of that kind and maybe a little bit of information about Nash's family and childhood. John Nash finally received the Nobel Peace Prize for Mathematics, which is a consolation, but the tragedy of his gifted mind is attacked by delusions was something I will not forget. I came out of this movie with a lot of compassion for John Nash. Schizophrenia is really a horrible mental illness. It's worth watching this movie and I think it will stand the test of time.""",1
"b'I can not recommend this program enough. For those of us who are new to yoga and for whom exercise is only a tenuous memory, this gently stimulating exercise will have you hooked before you know it. Four levels of intensity are shown for each pose. This accomplishes two things: 1) not scare people who can not put their ankles behind their heads at the moment, and 2) provide incentives to fight for the next level. For those who complain that this program is just an eye wash, remember the three areas that a full exercise regime should address: strength training, aerobic conditioning and flexibility. & quot; Yoga conditioning to lose weight & quot; It is an energizing way to achieve this last thing while I am, dare I say it, ... fun!'",1
"b'This is the worst movie I have ever paid to see in a theater. That does not mean that it would not be a good rental; where through multiple viewers you could lower the viewing price to 15 cents per person, but that would be too much to pay for this movie. WWE Entertainment must stick to what it does best: fight in events where the story is best within the square circle. Outside of a Terminator reference made to Robert Patrick, this is a total loss of 91 minutes of your life.'",0

"b'I felt compelled to write a critique of this movie for several reasons. First of all, because this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I never get tired of watching this movie again and again and sharing it with other people who have not had the pleasure of seeing it yet. I also wanted to write this review because many younger movie fans immediately dismiss old movies and especially black and white movies. And finally, I wanted to do my bit after reading the criticism of the `` professional critic ... misinterpreted? ? ? HOW could there be a better and more perfect cast movie? ? ? Gregory Peck, whom he had come to venerate as Atticus Finch in ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" (he is the reason why he wanted to be a lawyer when he was a child), and Audrey Hepburn has the perfect blend of innocence and courage for his role as the rebellious princess. Even Eddie Albert as a side of the comedy was ideal. This film follows a princess who, at first glance, lives an enviable life of wealth, fame and glamor. It has always been difficult for me to find compassion for the complaints of similar people, either in real life or in the film, but somehow Audrey Hepburn takes off and it is not difficult to encourage her, since she experiences things as basic as deciding how her hair should cut and eat an ice cream. While Gregory Peck is undeniably gentle as the dishonest American journalist, he is also able to achieve the sleaze necessary to make his role credible. You have to be able to understand that your initial motivation does NOT come from a ""good place"", but simply from greed and selfishness ... but you must also believe in your change of heart and its subtlety. And works . He does not wake up suddenly and has a change of heart. You can see its transformation, or its relevance, in the course of the movie. Like a romantic wardrobe, I have to say that I always secretly wait for a better ending (and for `` better \'\' I do not mean in terms of the quality of the film, I mean in terms of a classic \'\' happy ending \'\') . The final scene is heartbreaking, but the only possible way it could end. I always wonder what the hell happened next, despite knowing the answer very well ... and it is not necessarily what we would all like to imagine. But I respect the fact that the film does not spell it and does not wrap it all in a beautiful reverence. It\'s still a tearful ending, but exactly as it should be. Please, watch this movie. You\'ll want to have it later, I promise. And do not be fooled, it\'s not just an old and old-fashioned girl movie. \'\' It\'s just good. Oh, yes, and that * factor sigh * ... HUGE! Enjoy and share with the younger crowd so that this classic never gets lost in the modern box office hits.'",1
"b""Too often, Hollywood has announced a movie 'Based on a true story' to continue with a twist and add to the story of real life that the film becomes a lie. Not here. This is absolutely true: the story of one of the most incredible mountaineering accidents that has ever occurred. Filmed as a recreation and as a documentary, with the three main characters telling the story in their own words, it was a stroke of genius. How can I check it before? is it released? Here in the United Kingdom, this DVD has been out for a few months: all of us who have listened to it were left speechless with amazement at an unusually constructed film but totally faithful to reality.""",1

"b'The movie is excellent, and I give it five stars. However, I have been informed in an e-mail newsletter: ""Please keep in mind that Peter still gets money from sales of Unicorn movies ONLY through Conlan Press."" That also applies to this new edition of Blu- If you buy it anywhere else, Peter gets nothing at all, which really sucks when you consider that 1.8 million DVDs of Last Unicorn have been sold in the United States since 2004, and only about 6,000 of them. they went through Conlan Press, none of the other copies earned a penny for Peter, so encourage all of your acquaintances to help by buying the combined package through Conlan Press, and nowhere else. I know if this is also true for Amazon\'s sales, but anyway, Amazon should address the problem directly and clarify this. ""I\'m not comfortable putting something like this in an Amazon review, essentially an add-on pair to another provider, but I think it\'s important information.

"b'Among the best crime movies of the 1970s. Michael Caine has had many memorable characters (Harry Palmer being another). Caine is cruel and unstoppable like Carter. Somehow, among all his evil deeds, he still has a kind of charisma (I would not go so far as to say he is kind). I saw it as a double feature with Point Blank, but it would play just as well with another movie like Straight Time or The Outfit. Thank God for a DVD with a widescreen transfer and special features! This is one of those movies that is hoping to find more fans as their availability increases. Truly a classic. Carter is the bad prototypical, the bad man.'",1
"b'Finally I gave all the hype and really went to see Minority Report. The question that remains for me now that I have seen it is: what was all the exaggeration about? Although I must admit that some of the special effects generated by computer were impressive, the performance lacked any type of substance. However, what bothered me most was the incredible amount of products placed throughout the film. Was not Mr. Spielberg sure if he would earn enough money at the box office to advertise Aquafina, Pepsi, Gap, Lexus and Nokia throughout the film? In general, I spent two and a half hours in the movie during which I asked myself more than once if all the people who walked through the cinema during the screening of the film, were they as bored as I was? The bottom line is, good free special effects and some interesting scenes like the chase at the car factory, other than I can watch commercials on my TV at home for free.'",0
"b'This cartoon was different from any other produced by Disney or anyone else for that matter.

"b'. This film shows the reality of how cold, hard and unjust life can be, but it also gives us hope. I was a little nervous near the last part of the movie that I was going to have a & quot; Hollywood goofy ending & quot; but a very surprising twist of the plot left me stunned. This is an excellent story told superbly. This movie is what would define what an excellent movie should be. Film schools should require students to study and consider the methodology of this production. Here is a test of billions of dollars and the effects of high-tech hocus pocus are not necessary to hit a home run. In fact, I would say that this movie is more like a Grand Slam.'",1
"b""After his son is involved in the murder of his girlfriend, parents Streep and Neeson disagree on what course of action to take. Should the son Furlong tell the truth as Streep advocates or should he go with Neeson, who has already destroyed the evidence on his behalf, and invent a new version of the facts in an effort to stay out of jail? The slogan of how far you would go to protect your own flesh and blood promises much more than it offers. In fact, it never manages to increase the tension, even in scenes that, by right, should be the most interesting in the film, like the revelation of what really happened between Furlong and his girlfriend. All performances are intact and correct; this is exactly the kind of role that fits best with Streep (although it was much nicer in 'The River Wild'), Neeson is also very good in an unfortunate and stereotypical role, although Furlong is often pigeonholed as the problematic teenager plays it better than any other. However, the main flaw is that something that promises emotion never reaches a boiling point and, despite the names of stars, you can not help thinking that everything looks a lot like a television movie. All this and the end does not offer any kind of conclusion or redemption for your character, leaving your audience hanging, but without worrying about anything.""",0

"b'Light years below the first two films in writing, direction and character development. The movie was full of holes in the plot that even my 9 years could see. She thought it was fun in some places, but even then, most of the obvious settings for the jokes were not fun and there were several fires there. I hated the Flame that spit and that just drooled and drooled. He combined the babbling with his ""South American"" accent and it is difficult to understand what he says most of the time.

"b'Wolverine and the X-Men were a fantastic adaptation of the X-Men for this generation. The episodes were very well written and sometimes it felt like watching a Bryan Singer X-Men movie in animated form. Not only was it a great action for the TV-Y7 rating, but the plot was very mature and felt like a Toonami-style drama with some heartbreaking and honest moments that made this series incredible. It may be the best Marvel caricature ever made. It is disappointing that this program has not had a second season, hence the name ""The Complete Series"" instead of ""The Complete 1st Season"" as it should have been.

It also shows how human Jesus was, how he fought with the same things that we fight with. It was God's goal to send him here and this movie really captures him. My son & amp; Husband also loved it.

The makeup effects of Tom Savini are amazing, even by today's standards, since I think he is the master of all make-up artists.

"b""& quot; The return of the living dead & quot; is a hilarious horror / comedy inspired by George A. Romero & quot; Living Dead & quot; films . I saw this movie when I was just a little boy and I loved it. This is almost like Camp 80 like horror movies. The premise of the film is a nice tribute to Romero. Apparently, the movie & quot; Night of the living dead & quot; It was based on a true story, and was covered by the government of the United States. The bodies of the zombies were sealed in drums of oil and dispersed. Two workers in a medical supply store find one of these drums, pierce it by accident and release a gas that revives nearby dead. Luckily, the store is right next to a cemetery. The rest write to himself, and the movie has some of the funniest moments in the history of horror movies: a corpse running in the warehouse, the head of a zombie being beaten out of the park with a baseball bat, a zombie ordering & quot; more paramedics & quot; As if he were asking for pizza And, above all, an elegant 80's rock soundtrack. This is one of my favorite movies of the party, because it makes everyone (even non-horror fans) howl. At some point it is bloody, but the comedy eclipses the elements of terror. The DVD in question is a little light on the extras, except for a documentary that is fun, but tepid. But the big advantage is the best quality of image and sound in which I have seen this movie. The DVD really makes a difference. Get yourself a copy and see what I mean, you will not regret it.""",1

"b""Because this movie is sold out, it took me a few weeks to find a copy. However, once I did, I felt as if I had found the Holy Grail horror movie. The story revolves around a scandalous affair of a bored housewife (Julia Cotton) and her brother-in-law (Frank Cotton). Julia and her husband move to Frank's old house after Frank's sudden disappearance. Of course, Frank has not really disappeared. Instead, the perverted brother-in-law has found a cube-shaped puzzle. The puzzle, when it opens, opens a portal to the world of the Cenobitas. The Cenobitas offer the maximum pleasure, but at a high cost. Now that he can escape from the world of the Cenobitas once a drop of his brother's blood has been spilled on the floor of the house, Frank returns like a walking corpse, needing parts of the body of living beings to be completed again. Frank uses his past relationship with Julia to convince her to bring him new victims. With each victim, Frank becomes more complete, but also more impatient. There are several scenes of omen, praying mantis and evil spider with Julia as she goes out to the bars and picks up random men for the kill. Of course, eventually her actions arouse suspicion in her adult stepdaughter and her husband ... The film introduces the introduction of the Cenobites, which are some of the most frightening cats in horror since the Alien Xenomorphs. As the film progresses, we learn more about these beings, their origin and purpose. Of course, the ending leaves everything open, which leads to several sequels. I recommend this movie to those who like to watch early horror films made by those who now consider themselves masters of the genre.""",1
"b""For the great admirers of Manhunter, I would advise you to stay away from this DVD if you plan to have ... What has been announced as the & quot; Theatrical & quot; the version is in fact a poorly spliced \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bversion that awkwardly edits two scenes that had appeared at the theatrical premiere, including one of the most crucial scenes, and still has within it the most banal footage restored from the floor of the cutting room . These cuts are badly made and do not make sense to them, since they do not represent the theatrical presentation and destroy the impulse of what had been a finely edited film. I do not know if it was ignorance or arrogance, but this is the worst hacking work I've seen trying to pass itself off as a product. Whoever was in charge of this in Anchor Bay was an idiot and if I were Michael Mann, I would be calling my lawyers. & Quot; Director's Cut & quot; it is even worse in the sense that it includes the & quot; Not theatrical & quot; launch And the so-called & quot; Director's Cut & quot; - a compilation of some interesting and not so interesting shots. As a companion to a true theatrical premiere, this would have been a fascinating addition; BUT here once again, Anchor Bay finds a way to ruin what a good product should be. All the film that has not been processed in video, is stained and blurred, as if it had been transferred from a VHS tape, and a very worn one. - It is incredible that someone can have the audacity to offer this kind of cheap for the hard earned money. I saw this movie when it first came out in the theater and I considered it one of the best of that year; and I rushed to buy the LaserDisc version when it came out. When Anchor Bay released the Director's Cut DVD this year, I was on the waiting list, ready to receive the enhanced THX version with wide screen. Being intimately aware of the movie, imagine my disappointment. Do not waste your time. Wait for a better version to come out. As for those people who wish to compare the Silence of the Innocents with Manhunter, they usually prefer one above the other and their minds are practically invented at this time. I'm in Manhunter's camp. For me, I enjoyed the Silence, but I could never take it seriously, since I found the reader's notebook so caricatur- ally superhuman and, therefore, unrealistic and not very instructive. However, the Manhunter Reader is a chilling but more realistic description that impresses me every time I see it in how an evil genius manages to manipulate events outside his cell through the simple device of a telephone. This Reader is safe behind closed bars, and still manages to be a powerful presence to consider. I hope every fan and future fan of Manhunter sees it the way it came out, a fine piece of art that was slim and stylish, but that flowed with style. Siskel and Ebert rated it as one of the best films of all time, years after its release. But for now, I'm going to have my LaserDisc.""",0

"b'The 3 movies are pretty and sit on the edge of your seat, but most people already know the stories. The first of the 3 movies, The Bourne Identity has excellent videos and a very discreet channel tracking in the audio. The sound mixers did an excellent job of using all the surround channels and did not allow the soundtrack to hide the various foley effects on any of the front or rear channels. Of course, in all the excitement, your subwoofer will get a good workout. The video transfer is quite good, with no video noise, aliasing or artifacts. This movie started the whole franchise and it was a super start. My only question was how Bourne getting shot in the back took out his amnesia in the first place. That was never really answered, since amnesia would generally arise from a severe head injury and not from two bullets in the back. The Supremacy of Bourne, the second film of the trilogy, made much greater use of the handheld camera, and while it did it does not bother me, I remember a friend and professional photographer, mentioning that it made him dizzy. The transfer of video in Blu Ray was excellent in all aspects, but I also noticed much less use of directional audio. Instead of putting money into a more discreet sound edition, the producers increased the soundtrack that enveloped practically the entire sound stage, front and rear. It\'s not that the soundtrack does not fit the film, it certainly does, and it creates the atmosphere of emotion that Bourne\'s film requires, but a greater focus on the 5.1 sound stage for the Foley effects would have been nice. The last of the Trilogy, the Bourne Ultimatum completes the package with the same force in the video transfer. I did not see any weakness in any of the video transfers for the 3 movies, but once again, in the Bourne Ultimatum, one would think that with all the excitement, the use of the front and back sides would be more prominent. I was disappointed that, like Bourne\'s Supremacy, they simply upped the audio levels of the soundtrack, which would eclipse any Foley effect. I am not saying that there is no use of speeches in any of the last two films, but nowhere as much as it could have been or as was used in the first Bourne Identity. To save $ only increase the level of the soundtrack and that\'s a shame. During the scene of the fight things are thrown, crystals are broken and all kinds of chaos are produced that could easily have been directed to the left or to the right, forward or backward. Therefore, in that aspect, I was disappointed. However, this is a great collection and the excitement and pace of the 3 films are excellent. There are many deleted scenes and other \'making of\' shorts, as well as comments with no waste of space for previews and other movie ads. Well worth the cost. Honestly, this review has been helpful and, if so, check the ""Useful"" button, so I know I\'m on the right track with my comments for you. Thank you .'",1
"b""From time to time a movie appears that has almost no publicity or even a decent release for the general public, oh, the purgatory of film and limited releases. However, in the case of Equilibrium I am more surprised at why this never received a wider version. Seeing the movie, honestly, I did not have many expectations, apart from watching some great shooting games and martial arts as the star of the movie. While this factor proved to be entertaining, the real star belongs to the finely designed script that pays homage to novels such as `` Brave New World '', `` 1984 '' and `` Fahrenheit 451 ''. History places the viewer in the post-apocalyptic world of the future. Having suffered the aftermath of World War III, the survivors were banned together to form a new society that would free them from the greatest faults, emotions. Controlled by a drug, which annuls such senses, the future is a utopia free of war, but enslaved to those who exercise power and the establishment created. Art, music, literature, all this is forbidden and the penalty for committing such crimes of the senses is death. The most feared of the protectors of the establishment is the Cleric. A group of men trained in mind and body to be the perfect killing machines and the children of their ideals. One of those clerics, who even executed his own partner to read a book of poems, begins to see the world in a new light when he misses his usual dose and experiences a torrent of emotions that he had never felt before. While trying to maintain his duty, he finds the cruel sadism of his appointed task almost more than he can bear. In a desperate search he tries to find the resistance and put an end to the madness he has safeguarded. Christian Bale, playing the cleric, is amazing giving depth and emotion to a role that did not demand any. In this, it makes the film even deeper. The cinematographic style and the edition, lent by filmmakers like John Woo and Tsui Hark, contribute the freshness enough while they adapt those styles. Art direction is appropriate to create a claustrophobic world of dismal lies. Although the backdrops of the city are not so impressive and obviously are CG effects. The music, sometimes dark and mixed with the conflict that looms, and then a fast-paced techno score that sets the pace of the shot without losing the rhythm. In total, Equilibrium is a dream of science fiction fans come true, but it is also a movie that fans of classical literature can also enjoy. While the ending may seem too simplified, I actually found that it has a deeper meaning, as well as an interesting comment about humanity in general. But most will be thrilled with the final ten-minute shootout, with an impressive sword duel. Equilibrium contains strong language and violence and is recommended for people over 17 years of age. For once, style and substance collide on celluloid.""",1
"b'I can not say more about this DVD! ! ! ! I think they did the best they could with the incorporation of music with phonetics.

I turned on this video a couple of times during the week for a few weeks for her to look at it and each time I started it in a different chapter.

"b""It has been fun reading these publications by people who were so moved and entertained by this movie. I saw it when it came out and I've had the Cat Stevens songs in my head ever since. It's one of those films that personally affects what drives fans to quote him, and my favorite moment after all these years is (as it is for some of these other writers) that Maude throws Harold's charm into the river, because now she '& quot; I always know where he is. & quot; That was my first experience with the depth of the movie, and I never lost it. If you have not seen the movie yet, you can probably read some of these publications and not ruin it. There is so much to laugh about and marvel at, and of course, those songs. . . .""",1
"b""This is one of the most beloved films by affictionados of the foreign cinematographic scene. Tati provided a brilliant link between the best that the silent film era and the modern movie had to offer. It is a relatively simple story of a clumsy man on vacation on the coast of France. But repeated visits, especially over the years, open up more and more treasures that until now had not been recognized, like a classic novel. I would be surprised if someone got excited about this movie the first time they saw it. Certainly not. But repeating the visits over the years will give you an appreciation of this movie that borders on worship. Every member of my extended family loves this movie, and everyone has a particular reason. Some adore it for its ability to perfectly capture a foreign place and time, which allows one to feel as if they themselves had escaped to the French coast during the afternoon. Some love Hulot's awkward but endearing attempts at romance. Many love bright visual jokes that are funny, no matter how many times you've seen them. But regardless of what a viewer loves most, everyone will feel a bond with the character of Hulot (and, in turn, M. Tati) that will last a lifetime. With this DVD, I can finally feel safe lending my beloved and grainy VHS copy. A classic of the film in every sense of the term.""",1
"b""When I was ten years old, my mother's uncle gave me his copy of the book A bridge too far from Cornelius Ryan. This was a very special gift from him, since he was deported to Germany to work for the Reich during World War II and never recovered mentally from what had happened to him. When I got the book, he lived in a small town, a few miles west of Arnhem, on the south bank of the Rijn River. Obviously, I was young to read the book at that time. Over the years, my interest in World War II and Operation Market Garden began to grow, and every time A Bridge Too Far was broadcast, I saw it. The scenes that represent the drops of the paratroopers and the assault of the Waal river were the most remembered. That, and the great musical score by John Addison. I finally bought the DVD and watched it several times since then. I must say that with every time I see it, the movie gets better and better. Especially with the close subtitles: first those that specify in what location we are. Without these, one could get confused where the viewer was taken from one scene to another. Second, since English is not my mother tongue, I was able to better understand some of the dialogues. (I finally understood what Liv was trying to say in Dutch =) The widescreen option is fantastic. You really get into the battle scenes and see all the extra pictures ... for example, when the John Frost battalion enters Arnhem, you see people riding bicycles in the background, which you can not see in the pan and version of scanning. But with a medium as good as the DVD, and also with the 25th anniversary of the cinema last year, MGM and United Artists lost a great opportunity. It's a pity that the only extra is the original theatrical trailer. I really would have liked to see extra behind the footage of the scene included in a second album. The Dutch Broadcasting Company (NOS) must have a large amount of archive footage, I remember that the news broadcast often spends time filming the film, like the excrement represented. In addition to that filming, the studio must also have additional images. They could even produce a new documentary about the filming of this film, including interviews with the main actors and Sir Richard Attenborough. And what about the original footage and notes about the battle that took place? Despite this failure, it is still a must buy if you like classic movies or war movies. After 25 years it still has its own and it is still an emotion to look at. Buy it, and in the meantime keep waiting for a special edition on DVD. I give this DVD 4 stars, but if they had included the extra material, I would easily get 5 stars!""",1
"b'This movie has always been one of my favorites. I have three copies on VHS (two backup copies only in case the one I usually see runs out). I make all my friends look at him, and most of them love him as much as I do. It\'s stupid, completely inept and totally funny. I put it there with `` Forbidden Zone \'\' by Richard Elfman and `` Crimewave \'\' (also known as `` The Big Crimewave \'\') by John Paiz as one of the three best cult films of all time. Only The problem is that nobody has heard about this movie. So I could not believe my luck when I stumbled on the DVD! ! ! I thought I was dreaming. I was tempted to buy three copies ... just in case. First, I saw the deleted scenes and the extras, which were great. However, it seemed strange, because I had seen many of the deleted scenes (they are part of my VHS versions). Then, when I settled down to watch the movie, my heart broke. Someone, in his infinite wisdom, decided to censor almost all the nudity, and many other scenes have been shortened, or completely missing. I suppose this version of the film may seem a little more competent, because the missing scenes may have slowed down the pace of the movie a bit, but the scenes that were missing were UNSUSIVABLE. The ineptitude of this movie is what made it special, and editing it in a more ""professional"" version is a blasphemy on the limit. After seeing this edited and censored version, I wished I had never bought it. I wish it did not exist. Thank God for my copies of VHS. Whoever decided to censor and edit this movie should be ashamed of himself. Thank you very much for destroying one of my favorite movies. I only give two stars because some of the extras are great.'",0

"b'I\'m just writing this review, so this movie does not have the sadly wrong 3 stars of the other reviewer. There are a handful of truly great films from the Vietnam War, and generally each covers its own terrain. Full Metal Jacket is a kind of exception, since it covers the ground, the other three do it separately. Platoon covers the real combat, the feeling of hell that produced in an individual experiencing the fight, the jungle, the trauma in the moment when The Deer Huntsman covers the trauma of the postwar period, the long-range effect on the psyche of a veteran. Apocalypse Now covers the psychological (and poetic) heart of war, that is, the core of what war means, which is hatred, fear and the ruthless nature of the universe. After all, it\'s based on \'Heart of Darkness\'. ""It could, in general, be the most frightening and convincing of all."" In turn, Heart of Darkness and this film are based on a long line of literary backgrounds called `` katabasis \'\' in Greek, that is, the descent into the underworld. It is epic, punctuated by scene after scene that becomes dark and twisted, and the protagonist self-impelling, advancing to hell without knowing why, because as evil exists, he is attracted to it, to try to understand it, or if he can not , be part of it. Transitively, he asks you to try to understand evil. If I still do not have it, I would definitely buy it instantly for $ 6, as anyone who looks at this page and has not seen the movie should do so.'",1
"b""I never had the chance to go see this movie when it hit theaters. I rented it without knowing what to expect. After watching it on DVD, I can say that I would not have minded paying the ticket price of the movie to watch this movie. It's not that glamorous, but what it is is a nice, respectable and respectable movie. Gabrielle Union does a good job playing a rude, nasty, hater of men with the name of Eva. Sometimes she takes it over, but that is acting and that is what she is paid to do. Eva is determined to take care of her little sister, who all bow to her instead of her men. The sister loves Eva and listens as if her word were the gospel. Men, on the other hand, hate their guts and want nothing more than to see her leave the city. He often interferes with the relationships of his sisters and insists on driving the men of his sisters crazy. Therefore, in order to bring order to their respected relationships, men plan to take Eve out of their lives. Therefore, the need for Ray (LL Cool J). Ray is a beach that speaks without problems with a serious game. The men tell Ray to go out with Eva to get her out of their lives. Ray agrees and that's how the story began with two people who fall in love with one another and are not supposed to fall in love. That's when things get complicated for Ray and Eva. Some parts of the movie were a bit outrageous and the end was not the best, but still, it was still a pretty good movie. I have read some of the reviews of this movie and other movies as well. What happens is that if you want real life situations, you see a drama or a real story. This is comedy ... Comedy is not supposed to be real. It is really an escape from reality. Do not we all need that now? Anyway, in addition to the ending, this film was well done with the supporting actors doing a great job interpreting their respected roles. Also, the women in this movie are pretty good. Also, LL did a good job playing Ray. I have a lot of respect for him as an actor. He did not do his part too much, but he made it credible. In general, I give this movie a B +. The ending was a small clich\xc3\xa9.""",1

I was so disappointed with Warner's DVD release. Half of the music is off. And what's worse, half of the sound effects are missing. The sound of the swords. The screech of the Eagles. The sound of Sting cutting spiders. The sound of Glamdring cutting Goblins. Much more . Everything disappeared. They even cut pieces of dialogue. At one point, Bilbo seems to be talking only because the dialogue outside the camera is gone. The movie has been dead and lacks emotion. I hope they correct this with a future release. H3ll, if nothing else, you could get the laser disk (remember those? Heh-heh *) and extract the soundtrack from that. Anything is better than this, Warner. You are an old company.

A small film about a family and the small trials and tribulations that go through the day to day. It is very realistic and it deals with the most common everyday things. What makes this film so amazing is how it is able to present this window in the life of this group of people with such ingenuity and insight, sadness and honesty; Ultimately, it results in a film that is tender and uplifting and full of hope. Acting is simply amazing. There are no other words to say it. Everyone, from Brenda Blethyn to Timothy Spall, to Marianna Jean Baptiste, to Claire Rushbrook, everyone takes turns stealing scenes in performances that are so natural and punctual that, sometimes, it does not even feel like you're acting. This is a real performance that goes straight to the heart. The script is wonderful, because it provides so many small details that one would not think of including in a movie. Only the smallest things that in some way give life to the characters. A wonderful movie that will never be acclaimed because everything is about the actors. There are no special effects or sex scenes of halle berry. No way, this is an actor's movie. And they steal the show. If you like REAL cinema, do not miss this movie jewel. IT IS SIMPLY WONDERFUL.""",1
"b'As other people have said, I expected to see an authentic adaptation of H.G. Classic Wells novel. At the same time, I was aware that this film was made with a modest budget, with the expected results. Well, this movie was worse than I expected. The special effects seemed somewhat caricatural, especially in comparison with the state of the art (Spielberg). Worse still, the use of color filters in many scenes became extremely annoying after a while. Even the overall quality of the print was, at best, mediocre, with an oversaturated color and just sharpness. And the performance will not receive any Oscar nomination. Also, I wonder if the original 3-hour release would be better to see it in the story. In this 125-minute version, there are many jumps from one subframe to another without proper scene development, in my opinion. The Martian ""red grass"" appears briefly in some scenes without any explanation. On the positive side, I thought that the tripods and the handling machines looked very good, the sound effects are pretty good and the musical score is beautiful. Unfortunately, that is not enough to overcome production that would otherwise be poorly executed. If only the CGI was of the state of the art and the color filters were eliminated, it would be a good film, but not the best one. If only ... ..'",0

I am fascinated every time I see Bill Murray, totally self-centered, caught up in this wonderful paradox of time, living the same day over and over again. It goes through different stages: fear and confusion; euphoria, when he realizes that he can do NOTHING without consequences; Despair, when he realizes that life has no meaning if one pursues selfish pleasures without goals; and finally, a peaceful self-realization when it is dedicated to personal improvement and the humanitarian objectives that your situation gives you the opportunity to follow.

She still looks pretty and tries to look tough while pressing buttons and gives updates to Stephen Dorff when he can see for himself what is happening. Very foolish! ! 5) The director can not create a suspense scene for his life. They relied too much on special effects and less on finding a better director. In general: it's not even worth renting.

Leaving aside her personal image, outside the camera, she was terrible in this movie, but the movie also stunk. What were you smoking to put this debacle in theaters? Hmm, it seems like a bad trip ... Lohan has that hoarse and hoarse voice that puts you on your nerves, just like your close cousin Miley Cyrus, and puts on your last courage very fast, just like a squeaky knob. You have no idea what is happening at the beginning, and then it develops worse than the most horrible offer that Lifetime has given us over the years. The terrible casting and the lousy dialogue are driven by a stupid title that does not work. true ring. Too bad it did not drive directly on a cliff. Add to the fact that we have the irritating Julia Ormond `` playing '', a mother who lets her daughter climb the stairs with a boyfriend and bites her brains loudly. Oh yeah ? I do not care who you think you are; amnesia, or whatever, would not be enough to allow my children to indulge in carnal pleasures under my roof. You do not like any of these characters and you do not feel sorry for them. That is the key to a great movie in ANY genre: to feel compassion, or at least empathy, for at least two people in a show. There's nothing like that here, and they treat us with tons of bloody scenes that do not even come out with the desired effect.

"b'Ah, Gargoyles, finally get a deserved DVD release. This series is really excellent and has the honor of being one of Disney\'s most mature animated series to date. The series focuses on a group of living gargoyles, which are stone during the day and meats at night. Due to a curse on them, a small group of these creatures froze on stone for a thousand years before they woke up again in Manhattan in 1994. Like all supernatural beings in Manhattan, they naturally decide to fight crime. It may sound corny, but in the hands of a splendid team of writers, the series becomes much more than another story of ""fight against non-human superheroes."" Instead, Gargoyles becomes an interesting story with a captivating story and good characters. This series is benefited by its ability to take risks: the first episode even ends with what is essentially a mass murder. The program also addresses issues such as gun control in a fairly mature and realistic way, without becoming overly moral or prosaic. For example, the gun control episode ""Deadly Force"" (shamefully omitted by Toon Disney in his series career due to the presence of guns and gunfire, despite his strong message * against * inexperience playing with such weapons and fortunately restored without cuts in the release of the DVD) transmits its message without the characters remain saying `` The weapons are bad, mm\'ay? ""The series also has a continuity rigidity that is rarely seen in American animated cartoons, the actions in previous episodes affect the later and the episodes have a fairly established order: unlike other Disney toons at that time, the episodes Gargoyles usually had to be transmitted in the correct order to make sense, the series is also full of references to Shakespeare (and other things, the first episode of the second season contains, of all things, a Kafka joke that I did not get during * years *) .Gargoyles is really one of the most interesting and unique series of cartoons in the Disney vault.This DVD is a great buy for the fans of a lifetime and highly recommended for new people who are curious to know The first season sets the rest of the series beautifully and gives the viewer an idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bwhat this series is about in general.

"b'If anyone doubts the temporary quality of fame, just think of Douglas Fairbanks to clarify the point. In his time, the fame of Douglas Fairbanks was unprecedented. He and his wife, Mary Pickford, were considered the real family of the United States. Today, his wonderful action movies are not seen but by movie enthusiasts, and his face and his name are lost to the younger generation (if Jay Leno\'s ""man on the street"" interviews are any indication, our younger Americans) they seem proud to know the name of the Vice President, let alone a silent film actor like Fairbanks). That Douglas Fairbanks disappears from memory is tremendously sad. `` The Mark of Zorro \'\' is a good example of the kind of film in which Fairbanks specialized towards the end of the silent film era, and was very popular due to the dynamic presence of its star. There really has not been anything comparable with Fairbanks since his departure from the movies. No action star can approach his grace and power in an action movie. If you doubt me, buy this DVD and check it out for yourself. Watch Fairbanks jump over the tables, jump over high walls to climb a horse, jump from the table to a ledge near the ceiling, etc. And it was not only that he was able to do these feats, but that he did them effortlessly. The sheer grace of man was really exciting. He never seemed to strive for anything. I noticed this as I looked at the Mark of the Fox during a scene when Fairbanks lifts a leg and dismounts a horse running, at a gallop, to land as easily as if he were getting off the ladder. It made it look so easy, I went back and saw the scene again to make sure I saw what I thought I had seen. Yes, he had, soft as silk. Then there is his performance. In this film, Fairbanks plays a role of duel: Don Diego, a noble and elegant young man, and his masked counterpart, Zorro. His portrait of Don Diego is subtle and effective. Your body seems shapeless and smooth. His attitude is distracted and indecisive and vaguely lost. He detests the use of the sword and constantly cleans his face due to his great ""fatigue"". \'\' When his love interest declares `` He is not a man, he is a fish! \'\' She hits the nail in the head. However, when he puts on the mask, his body and form are reborn. His body looks agile and full of movement, and his smile, that tremendous and radiant smile that radiated pure happiness, is almost as devastating as his sword. Finally, there is the artistic design and the decorations of this film. Fairbanks loved these period pieces, and spared no expense in research and details. Their care, financial investment and dedication to craftsmanship really show. Everything has a beautiful, ""deep"" feeling. As a side note, this review is based on Kino\'s DVD release of this film and, as with all Kino releases, this edition seems simply great. God Bless Kino for being one of the best companies that preserves and commercializes silent films. If you have taken the trouble to read this review, buy this movie. If you do, Douglas Fairbanks will again be popular and famous, at least in your heart.-Mykal Banta'",1

The DVD is divided into sections and you can choose which muscle groups you want to work on. What I like is that she mentions that you can not reduce the point, but you can work on each muscle to shape it. You can also play the whole set that lasts 40 minutes. This is for athletes from intermediate to advanced level. [ ... ] I really liked it .'",1
"b'A terrorist organization seized some nuclear bombs and now terrorizes the known world. Sounds familiar ? Well, there are some things that make THIS movie set. THESE terrorists act like garbage. In fact, the ""hero"" (a seal of the navy discarded with the charisma of a road skunk) makes you wish that the terrorists killed him already. Why would I buy this movie? Simple . Leslie Nielsen appeared on the cover (at least in the Dutch version). Being a fan of him, and hoping to find an older film in which his acting skills were still appreciated, I picked it up. Yes, he does it well. No, he is not in the movie for more than 5 minutes. I am a great movie buff, but I have the feeling that I lost an hour and a half of my life. I pass by here.'",0
"b'MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT multi-channel packages are reasonably priced and of good quality. These twenty transfers of public domain movies without restoration vary from very good to sometimes fair; none is impossible to see. The `` legendary detectives \'\' of this DVD package are all series of films derived from the thirties and forties. `` The Shadow \'\' was a half-hour radio series broadcast for the first time on 31/31/30. Originally, only the narrator of mystery stories, in 1937 `` Shadow \'\' Lamont Cranston (now portrayed by a young Orson Welles) had become an integral character in each episode aired. The program\'s 24-year career ended the day after Christmas 1954. Shadow\'s three films here were first seen in 1937, at the height of the popularity of the radio show. `` Bulldog Drummond \'\' was created in 1920 by the British author Herman McNeile, who published under the pseudonym `` Sapper. ""Drummond\'s stories were directly influenced by"" noir ""detectives, then popular in American fiction, and are considered to be the precursors of James Bond.The half-dozen films in this set that feature this character are all from the end of the decade. 1930. `` Dick Tracy \'\' was a crime comedian created by the pen and imagination of the Detroit newspaper artist Chester Gould, in October 1931. Gould worked on the strips until he retired in 1977. Other artists continue to produce In the comics, police detective Tracy wooed his future wife Tess Trueheart for 18 years, and finally married her on Christmas Day 1949. During that time, Tracy ran into legendary bad guys like BB Eyes, Flattop Jones, Pruneface, Haf and Haf, 88 Keys, Mr, Crime, Sphinx, Pear-shape and Faceless Redrum Dick Tracy\'s radio show was broadcast from 1935 to \'48. In the movies, Tracy was mainly portrayed by Ralph Byrd (beginning in \'37). Byrd stayed with the series until it ended after a brief career in early television. `` Sherlock Holmes \'\', the most recognized fiction detective of all, was the creation of Scottish author and physician Arthur Conan Doyle. The histories of Holmes were published in several British magazines from 1887. Over the years, Conan Doyle tried more than once to kill the character, but the public outcry caused him to reconsider. Doyle wrote four novels and fifty-six short stories starring Holmes and Dr. John Watson, his friend and cohort in the adventure, until the death of the author of the knight in 1930.

"b'The special effects were fine, but the story was weak, silly and predictable. When I was a kid, I loved the Alien movies. Aliens (the second) is considered a classic in our house as we still laugh at how my mother made M & M rain in the theater after an alien frightened her. Then, with that, I was excited to see this movie and relive some of the memories. What a disappointment. It was not terrifying at all. The people in the theater were actually *** SLEEPING ***. I was jealous of them. In general, I was glad that this was a short film. Sadly, the most terrifying thing in this movie was a penguin. Do not see this.

Yes, each frame, the terrorist gag, the weapons return to where they should be, the musical score in the farewell scene restored to its original grandeur, and not digital shilly-shallying. What a treat ! Many thanks to Mr. Spielberg for finally recognizing the deliciously imperfect perfection of his original creation. I've seen this movie approaching 70 times, and I know where the rhythms are, from top to bottom. I was looking for changes and I could not detect any. Even the slight jump as ET indicates that the closet as `` home '' is restored. The original ILM animation of the bikes in flight has returned. The rope passage during the final hug is right where it should have always been. All the terrible sabotages have been eliminated. The transfer, from the original 35mm elements, is as perfect as it can be. The appearance of the theatrical experience fills the eye and the ear and, as always, the heart. Welcome `` home '', E.T. and thank you, Universal, for a job well done.""",1
"b'This will be referred to as a classic horror for years to come ... a horrible classic example of how Hollywood money can destroy a really good story. The plot, what there is of it, is nothing like the psychological horror story of Shirley Jackson. They are patches of frames that have no meaning, and dead ends. There are many CGI and special effects, which were certainly supposed to make up for the missing story. They do not. Nothing here is frightening, unless you find the idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bdusting wooden cherubs hilariously ugly scary. The decorations for the house were the best part, they were completely strange and unreal and, therefore, worth seeing. It seems that Liam Neeson was blackmailed to take part, and Owen Wilson, with a fixed smile rather like the aforementioned wooden cherubs, acts as if he were in a comedy from the start. The women, Lili Taylor and Catherine Zeta-Jones, manage a little better considering the material they are given. Zeta-Jones certainly looks good, colorfully tarty and all that, but she is not given anything to do, except to wander around with a colorful tarty look. Bruce Dern and Marian Seldes look as if they were having fun putting him in their roles as caregivers, but they were probably happy to have such small parts. This does not make it a ""good"" bad movie, and it really would not be worth it to hate it, except that it destroyed a book that was terrifying and intelligent.'",0

"b'""The Highwaymen"" by Robert Harmon is a fascinating and fast trip that catches you in the first pictures and will not let you go until you have shaken your brain 81 minutes later. Like Rennie, Jim Caviezel offers another poignant performance as the haunted husband who sees his wife run over by a rushed driver and runs and spends years chasing the guy. Caviezel\'s role is not as demanding or as gratifying as his interpretation of Catch in ""Angel Eyes,"" but it\'s well done. Colm Feore of `` Chronicles of Riddick \'\', `` Paycheck \'\' and `` Chicago \'\' is threatening as the disabled driver whose only enjoyment in life is to terrorize and kill women with his car. I watched the movie with an occupational therapist who had numerous comments about the representation of the disabled. Rhona Mitra, who is a television star, has shone brightly in `` Party of 5 \'\', `` Gideon\'s Crossing \'\', `` The Practice \'\' and now `` Boston Legal \'\', does a great job of being persecuted, scared and fighting. She shows a series of levels, actually more demanding than her appearances in `` The Life of David Gale \'\', `` Sweet Home Alabama \'\' or `` Get Carter. Frankie Faison, who plays the traffic inspector, has 4 films this year and is an actor of a busy nature (White Chicks, Cookout). His police detective is a little slow to understand the seriousness of what is happening and it becomes the complication of Rennie\'s search, but eventually he becomes an ally with the last farewell photo. Andrea Roth as the blonde Alex does a good but brief job before she gets stuck in the windshield of the Eldorado Cadillac. Yes, there are some holes in the plot and some jumps in the edit, but overall it\'s a great movie ride. Enjoy!'",1

"b'Unlike most of the other movies reviewed, the reviews of this movie are quite accurate. The film details the rise of the stardom of three girls from Ziegfeld; The character of Judy rises to stardom, the character of Hedy retires to a comfortable married life, while the character of Lana ""becomes a hoax"". The plot is too long, and the plot of Lamarr in particular is trivial and uninteresting. It\'s the numbers in one hand, and Turner\'s subplot in the other, what this movie does. The story of Lana\'s rise and fall from stardom is the only one worth seeing. This fleshy paper was the role that wore Lana\'s stardom. On the other hand, the numbers are stellar. Some might say overproduced, but I say spectacular, more particularly, the number `` Out of a Dream \'\' has the most glamorous disguises ever seen on celluloid. I have never seen such feminine beauty in my life; the beauty floating down the ethereal stairs, to the ethereal music sung by Tony Martin. He will want to see it again and again. Here are some mistakes you should observe: 1. In the number `` Minnie from Trinidad \'\', shortly after seeing the mule, you can see a dancer coming off the set, deep down, very out of sync with the music. The first time I saw this, I could not believe that the editor had missed it. Watch Judy VERY closely as she descends the stairs in the number `` Out of a Dream \'\'; You can see flashes of nudity as you approach the foot of the stairs! 3. In the number `` Out of a Dream \'\', all the girls are smiling ... except for Hedy Lamarr. This contrast is discordant. Hedy Lamarr\'s teeth were out of alignment in real life. She is an actress who was much more beautiful when she did not smile.'",1
"b'The quality of this DVD is frightening and practically impossible to see. Although I understand that the footage is old, I had no idea it would be so bad that it makes most amateur videos look like award-winning examples of cinematography. It is difficult to see that the kata is executed clearly, and due to the absence of audio in the clips (the only sound is the narrator and the funeral scene at the end), the breath can not be heard. The video is blurry, dark and visually & quot; noisy & quot; . The funeral scene at the end is so dark that it is difficult to see anything at all. Do not waste your money'",0
"b""In the 1960s, when the creation of films was still an art form, the master puppeteer, George Pal created what has been considered a true classic, The Time Machine. Selecting as his hero, the handsome, brave and elegant Austrian actor Rod Taylor, playing Herbert George Wells, the director accurately portrays the adventurer, but taciturn, Victorian as a gentleman, who ventures with inventions and yearns for a more peaceful century to live . Using what has been hailed as the best special effects of that date, Pal launches Taylor into the future. By stopping only to observe the changing epochs in which the war is fought with better and more sophisticated weapons, Wells finally arrives at the land of the Eloi. Here he meets the beautiful and sensual Weena (Yvette Mimieux) and his people. During their brief time together, Weena allows Wells to learn that despite her idyllic paradise, she is not without dangers. In this future, it is the Morlocks who have become the masters of the world and have stolen Wells' time machine. Condemned to spend eternity in the future, Taylor confronts the Morlocks, resulting in a story that will later relate to David Filby (Alan Young) and his friends from Victoria. The film is magnificent and, despite having been reworked several times, it has never been matched. H.G. Wells would have approved it. *****""",1
"b'Okay, quickly and without hesitation, click on the ""Back"" button of your web browser as many times as necessary to completely avoid seeing anything that has to do with this movie. If you ignored my previous advice, then it is obvious that you are seeing train wrecks, ten car accidents and small children frying ants with their magnifying glass. In other words, you are a cinematic sadist. If you\'ve seen this movie before, then you\'ve probably lost some self-esteem. If you plan to see it after reading this review ... you are just a masochist. Bodororayne is horrible. Beyond horrible. Ben Kingsley has made bad career decisions in his time, but this one takes the cake. Michael Madsen, who used to consider himself respectable, if not grandiose, heads toward the slope of the race failure faster than a mudslide in California after a monsoon. Michelle Rodriguez, who has openly declared that she wants to be a gypsy actress, a free spirit, is the most unharmed simply because you will limit yourself to that kind of professional decision. That does not free her from this parody. I can not imagine someone as rebellious as she standing in silence while this pile of crap was being thrown around her like trash in a landfill. And then there\'s Kristana Loken ... well, you can see her naked. That is the highlight of his role. And what the hell is Meatloaf doing in this movie ... and accredited by his FULL name? ! He chose this atrocity to decide that he wants him to credit TWO names instead of ONE. HUH? ! All the others are unknown, which surprisingly does not leave many roles for the unknowns. It was amazing how they brought this group of actors named for something so horribly bad. It\'s not just the actors, it\'s the dialogue, the F / X and even the plot ... what escapes me at the moment. I think I\'m trying to eliminate this movie from my memory. So do yourself a favor and get away, stay away, far away. Trust me, it\'s for your own good.'",0

"b'The Italian work of the 60s is well known to the British public, for whom the film is a regular part of Christmas television programming such as the James Bond movies, The Great Escape and the Queen\'s speech. The negative reviews of American viewers are due both to the lack of a cultural context and to the lack of familiarity with many of the cast members. The film has aged well and provides a fun, if somewhat rosy, snapshot of British culture in the 1960s. The cast includes Noel Coward as Mr. Bridger, the criminal mastermind, and Michael Caine as the cowardly Charlie Croker. The British public will recognize a number of well-known actors in cameo roles, including Benny Hill and John Le Mesurier. However, the stars of the film are, without doubt, automobiles. Interestingly, the range of supercars of the 60s, including a Lamborghini Muira, E-Type Jaguars and Charlie\'s Aston Martin, are being eclipsed by the three Mini Coopers that drive the Italian police in an incredible car chase through Turin. Remy Julienne and her team of stunt specialists produced one of the most amazing and known, at least for the British public, car chases in the movies. It could be said that it is still one of the best car chase sequences and even more because the stunts were filmed in locations in Turin (and Coventry in the case of sewer scenes) and in cars with minimal modifications. There are many memorable moments. in the movie beyond the Mini Cooper sequence. Caine has ""closed the doors"", the older lady of Benny Hill obsessed Professor Peach in the tram of Turin and the ending ""hanging"" stuck with me. The additional features of the DVD are good, but not really exceptional. The documentary \'Making Of\' provides a series of interesting ideas about the film. The comment overlay track is a bit forced, but it\'s worth listening to. There is only one deleted scene, the incredible \'Blue Danube\' car ballet on ice. In short, this is a true British classic with a great cast, score and plot. A nice snapshot of the London of the 60, a fantastic cast (at least for the public of the United Kingdom) and the magnificent scene of the car chase make this one to buy. The Hollywood remake, although not a bad movie in itself, shares only the title, a story based on a gold theft and the BMW Mini updated with the original. And for anyone who wonders about the original Mini, they really are small and very fun to drive.'",1

"b'28 Days Later is a film so well handled in terms of suspense, acting and meaning, that every time I look at it I am more convinced that it will become a classic in the genre of horror and science fiction. The same does not happen with the `` sequel \'\', which could be well directed by Fresnadillo, but is not well structured as a narrative, and does not lend any valuable ""message"" to the audience. 28 weeks later, the error of insulting our intelligence frequently occurs. How can it be explained that the husband of the surviving woman who is detained in a security center can have access to the room and not find any guard, or a doctor, or a soldier, or a vigilant staff in place ? There are not even cameras, in a situation where there is fear of the reappearance of the virus and it is possible, after the diagnosis made by the medical staff of the surviving woman. In fact, that is the key event that originates the violation of the virus. In addition, the film is so focused on the bloodshed, the bite and the vampire race, that a meaningful dialogue is not possible, which prevents one from having sense of the chaos. And what can you say about the helicopter used as a deadly power saw to decapitate dozens of zombie-vampires? The least I can say is that the scene is the peak of sensationalism. And insisting on the meaning of the film, why such a valuable element in history as the possibility that the survivor or her children have the key to the cure of the virus is simply wasted in favor of leaving the public with a terrible end, pessimistic and fatal? Is that the bait for another sequel, parallel to the series ""Alien""? Meanwhile, we have a `` sequel \'\' that does not adequately comply 28 days later, regardless of the fact that Boyle is among the producers.'",0
"b""It is a pity that Bruce Willis can not produce these films more often. John McClain is probably the best action hero in the entire history of cinema and this installment presents a great punch of action and humor. McClain is asked to bring in an alleged hacker to be interviewed by the FBI. The actor who plays this hacker is the guy who makes Apple McIntosh commercials. It is interesting to note that he seems to prefer a Mac in this case. Anyway, McClain appears just when the hacker is about to be hit by the bad guys. If it were any other movie it would be a guy with a magnum or a piano wire, but being a Die Hard movie, the bad guys come with ultramodern machine guns. Of course, McClain is able to take some of them and temporarily escape with the hacker. Therefore, we have the qualities of a great association as good as any for the Lethal Weapons films. The movie cheers you up all the time, especially when McClain teases the bad guy head by firing one of his key characters and then tell him I'm getting to get you. Kevin Smith has a bigger cameo like Warlock, a live at home with his mother hacker. It is a role that seems to have been made for him. This is the best Die Hard since the first movie!""",1
"b""I had no idea that Ganz had him so good until I saw him here as Hitler. Alexandra Maria Lara as her young and naive secretary is also very good. The cast is excellent. Director Oliver Hirschbieger cleverly assembles everything and will keep you on the edge of your seat all the time, although we all know how the story ended. The film gets under your skin and steals your mind long after you've seen it. that - and that's a trick. How could the creators of this film be able to achieve this? By avoiding the usual approach of turning Hitler and his murderous SS thugs into two-dimensional cartoon characters, they instead show that many of them were what they were: humans. Mixed murderers, disoriented, fanatics, barbers and cold-blooded, and all in the pursuit of power (which never reached), but human at all. The sad thing here, as far as I'm concerned, instead of encouraging your nation to concentrate all that energy on making the world a better place, because the Germans, the German people, have given us much more than good cars and excellent lenses of camera and beer ... Hitler and his thugs had their people wasting all that potential in causing destruction and chaos, misery and pain ... in vain. I realize that quite a few Germans did not care about Hitler and his crazy notions ... only there was not much they could do about (once he came to power and they saw where he was actually leading them ... straight to Hell) . Any German who opposed the feared SS and the Gestapo ended up dead or in some camp somewhere to suffer the consequences. I always wondered what it must have been like for Hitler and his people in that bunker during the last months / weeks / days. ..

It is a pity that what used to be a beautiful and memorable television movie has become a battered and vanished shadow of his former self. It is painful to see that something that has a special place in your heart is treated with such misery. For years, the only version that millions of people had seen on television had a faded color and a contrast so low that it almost seemed shot in black and white. If that is what you are used to, & quot; restored & quot; The version of this DVD (and the one shown on TV for the last 3 or 4 years) looks marginally better, but is barely restored. You just have to look at a deleted song in the extras section to see how beautiful and bright the original production was: crisp, clear, pristine, with highly saturated colors. The time and money SHOULD have been spent to bring the rest of the film to this standard. It is morally wrong to put a defective product on the market, then have the courage to collect money for it.

The Blu-Ray includes the unclassified cut / director and the additional scenes help explain the story a bit more and it is definitely the best version to watch. The acting is pretty blah (with the A & P-acting to most humans) although Ewen Bremner is funny. But the action is really what this film is about and here there is a lot of action and I think it was a very good ending.

That\'s a better star than the last `` remastered \'\' version that I reviewed ... the extra star is due to the fact that THIS, at least, is not missing a complete scene. Far from being remastered as stated in this release, if you can believe it, even worse than the other that I reviewed. First, it\'s dark and muddy, I had to raise the brightness of my TV almost all the time to see any detail. Second, the image is almost constantly filled with long (sometimes even half) scratches, black and white ""dropouts"", and a hair or fiber that appears at the top of the screen along all the front credits . Third, the color fluctuates several times throughout the film. Fourth, in some scenes the sound is a bit harsh. And to top it off the launch company (VCI Entertainment), not content with lying in its package, had the GALL to insert `` This special edition of the film has been digitally restored to its current condition \'\' before the film.

And Anthony Hopkins is also wrong to be a Jewish teacher with a hard blow, a secret past. While he is still one of my favorite actors, he can not escape his ""Britishness"" which is even more incredible once you discover what his character\'s past is!

For that reason, all its cinematography has been signed by novelty and original proposals, presented by unexplored territories and unthinkable stages. In this case, we witness the clash of two civilizations, visibly differentiated, the ancestral aborigines and the Western lifestyle, where myth and progress collide as the inevitable collision of two trains that displace each one, in opposite directions. A company will be installed in the middle of the Australian desert, in order to explore and exploit uranium reserves. But they will face ancestral tribes that oppose them because they will interrupt the dream of the green ants. A film dedicated to the mother of Herzog, with intriguing and acute reflections during the whole process, when this case is discussed in the Supreme Court. , through a very interesting test, where the happy ending will be absent. The final sequence will invite you to think and reflect.'",1

Having said that, however, I LOVE this movie completely! One of my favorite parts is the way that some of the best advice I\'ve heard about friendships and relationships in general are dispensed throughout the movie at times when you do not even realize you\'re learning something. Examples: Joe Santo (Arnold) is putting Craig Blake (Jeff Bridges) in training and advising him: `` You can not grow without burning! `` And we realize how deep that was when Joe repeats those words while the two fight over why Mary Tate Farnsworth (Sally Field) left Joe for Craig. In addition, there is Craig\'s uncle, Albert, whose voice is sometimes heard reading letters to Craig, saying: ""It does not matter what you do, as long as you do something, and do it without pretenses."" \'\'.

"b'I saw this movie about a month ago at the local film library. After about eighty minutes, I discreetly looked at my watch and was discouraged when I realized that the movie was not even half full. Celine and Julie are going to sail? Until now I had not seen a body of water, let alone a boat. Where was this strange story with scenes that were repeated over and over again, and when would it end? I\'m a patient movie viewer, but this was too much. A series of film critics, whose opinions I usually respect, have practically built religions around their appreciation for this film. I wondered if this could be a case of `` emperor\'s new clothes \'\'? Almost two hours later, everything was over and I left the theater thinking that I could have seen two real cinematic masterpieces at the time I lost in Rivette\'s movie ... But somehow, it was not really over. The effect of the film persisted. It was not just an intellectual enigma that I had to deal with, the movie had gotten under my skin. The scenes were repeated in my head like a strange dream. His rhythm was different from everything he had encountered before. Celine and Julie never met any of my expectations, and neither did Jacques Rivette. In two separate scenes from the film, Celine and Julie introduce themselves to the men, who unconsciously believe that they will meet the other woman. In each case, the two women completely subvert the worlds of men, making holes in their rigid conventionality. Throughout the whole movie, Rivette was doing the same with me. Everything in the film, from its ""plot"" to its subtle manipulation of reality and its rhythm, forces you to put aside your expectations (or be miserable trying to hold on to them). You have to relate to the film on its own level, as you would to a child. Only then can you enjoy it. I do not know exactly why the film had that effect on me, but it says something about its power that more than a month later I still think about it. In recent days I have had this growing impulse to see `` Celine and Julie Go Boating \'\' again. The ideal circumstance for a first encounter with her is definitely in a theater or it can end up turning it off. Now that I have crossed that Rubicon, I would like it to be available on a region 0 or 1 DVD, so I could waste another three hours more.'",1
"b""& quot; Back to the future & quot; It may be the most charming comedy / adventure there is. The film is a science fiction story about a young man who accidentally traveled in time from 30 years to the 50s. While smaller sci-fi movies would focus on the ideas of the paradoxes of time and hardware, & quot; Back to the future & quot; It focuses on the wonder of open eyes, charming characters and lots of good humor. The story begins with Marty McFly in 1985. Marty is a hopeless loafer with two foolish parents and a crazy scientific friend. Marty's friend, Doc Brown, has perfected a time machine with plutonium made from a DeLorean sports car. After a successful trial, Marty is accidentally transplanted to the year 1955 and was stranded there, he left his additional plutonium in 1985. What happens next is a series of wonderful surprises, since Marty interacts with the people of 1950 while looking for the version Doc Brown's youngest, but what is even more surprising and magical is Marty's relationship with his parents when they were teenagers. The film takes the perspective of a young man from his losing parents and makes him realize that at one point his parents were as hopeful and scared as he was. Finally he meets his parents for the first time. The film also suggests the hopeful notion that you can go back in time and help your parents when they needed it the most as Marty tries. While the movie is a joyful romp, there is a lot of action as Doc Brown comes up with an exciting plan for Marty to return to the future with lightning bolts, many visual effects and a high-tech endurance race. & quot; Back to the future & quot; It is the most balanced combination of science fiction, comedy and adventure.

"b'`\'I Know Who Killed Me \'\' is a scary little horror show that was designed as a kind of \'comeback\' vehicle for Lindsay Lohan in early 2007. Needless to say, the movie was not successful in that endeavor. Everything but. Lohan plays Aubrey Fleming, an attractive but relatively na\xc3\xafve high school student who is prey to a torture-crazy serial killer who manages to cut off some of her limbs before miraculously escaping from her clutches. When she wakes up in the hospital, she believes herself to be a girl named Dakota Moss, a kind of fictitious ""alter ego"" with a life taken from a mild pornography novel, which gives us ample opportunity to eat our eyes. Lohan, dressed in light clothes, turns in slow motion performing dances on a strip of poor quality. Aubrey, who is a fiction writer, simply a victim of repression, a wild and free spirit, so obsessed with being a ""good girl"" that she has allowed her true nature to remain buried in her subconscious. years ? And the trauma he suffered is simply the vehicle through which that true nature can now come to the fore? Or is there another less purely psychological explanation, say, symbiotic twins? - by this sudden change of identity? It really does not matter what the answers to these questions are, since this depressing foray into sadism, dismemberment and the supernatural hocus pocus is badly written, acted in an amateur way and completely devoid of emotion or common sense. Actually, history itself could have had some validity if it had not forced the audience to wallow in as many unpleasant injustices as it does. But, as it is, every time we begin to develop deeper interest in what is happening, we are subject to a new round of bloody bloodshed. Yuck'",0
"b""Having grown up with the original Thunderbirds on TV (even at B & W), I expected something better. I suppose that as we move a little, teenage pubescent anguish no longer attracts much. I wanted to see the machines, the drama, the tension of the people who face the disasters that took them beyond themselves, the triumph of decent people over the impersonal evil of nature and all those good things that the original had in abundance, along with a shyness and humor that was not taken too seriously. The original was about the adventure first, with the incidental 'romance', and that is an important point, rather lost in this film. This is a teenage movie that grows and uses the Thunderbirds as a cover. I really did not need the Thunderbirds part, except the sets. The plot is, otherwise, perfectly normal and can be seen anywhere. The degree of improbability involved is much greater than the originals and a bit difficult to bear. The acting leaves a lot to be desired, and yes, the puppets of the 1960s were often much more realistic than the actors in this movie, and Ben Kingsley does not really look evil, or even evil. So, if you want a teen movie like so many others, this is for you. If you want something like the original, do not bother with this movie. Wait until someone has the guts to produce an 'adult' movie (rated 'G') in the classical genre. Unfortunately, this is not a particularly memorable movie.""",0

"b""First let me say that, as a former military man, I am a great admirer of this film. I am also aware that when I write a review of something here, there are too many ad hominem attacks, and not refutations of the revision, which makes me reluctant to comment on anything. Having said that, I must admit that I am very disappointed with this Four Feathers Criterion theme. I have always thought that the Criterion DVDs are the best ones, and I thought that the blu-ray edition would be absolutely right, however, that is not the case with this one. I own an MGM edition of the film, and found that it is generally superior to that of Criterion. I do not know if I just have bad luck and I received a bad copy of the movie, but I'll send it to Amazon and I'll keep my copy of MGM. Issues to be mentioned: the Criterion edition, although more clear, has a very irregular color transfer, too bright in some places and with some discolorations in others. There are no subtitles on the Criterion DVD, but the MGM version has them, in several languages. I noticed that in several parts of the film the color faded and the backgrounds appeared washed, as if the film had been colored. As I mentioned, do not attack me personally for this review. If your copy of this movie is better than the one I wrote, then it will be good for you. I will still return the DVD to Amazon and leave it at that. This is only the opinion of a man.""",0

I realize they wanted a known set, but I should have died harder. And the death of Admiral Kirk was not enough to do him justice.

"b""Dumbo is a classic Disney movie, which is iconic in its imagery of the pink elephants and the small, poor elephant with ears too big to fit into the society of the elephants. This is a very sad and bittersweet movie, since Dumbo is removed from his mother, who takes pride in his lost son. Dumbo has to find his own identity and find a way to not be bothered all the time. Originally released in 1941, Dumbo has a duration of only 63 minutes. The special features of the Big Top Edition far exceed the function itself. There is a game that teaches children about circus animals, a storybook, two long songs, a music video, several Disney short films. Outside the track of comments and short films, little here is of value or interest to the adult. The real problem with this new edition of '' Big Top '' is that it is not significantly different from the `` 60th Anniversary Edition ''. There is a different music video, the addition of one function and the loss of others. The quality of the film itself is not dramatically different from the previous version. Honestly, Dumbo is a Disney movie that is worth owning. But it does not matter which edition you buy. Joe Sherry""",1

"b'Mike Leigh\'s films are improvised; almost all are interesting. They are generally beloved of the Oscars, and `` Vera Drake \'\' is no exception. I will not mention the plot, because, if you are reading this, you already know it. Imelda Staunton is, in fact, magnificent. I recently saw the movie, and last year at Oscar I thought I would win, because of the slug party that seems to involve Swank & Bening, the only times they were involved. I thought that the votes would be divided, as often happens. Imelda was kind, glorious, sweet and down to earth in this performance, a true amalgam of interpretive skill. Mike Leigh also used Brenda Blethyn to take advantage of `` Secrets & Lies \'\'. An excellent story and an interesting part of the story, this movie is wonderful, especially with respect to the other characters involved, all of which are excellent. Mr. Leigh is brilliant and uses women well; I hope he will soon get away from that improvisational tool that requires women to whine and cry. Imelda\'s whining was annoying, but, in ""Secrets & Lies,"" Blethyn was distracting him. Still, a wonderful show of acting, and a good person with good intentions that, unfortunately, were against the law. I am pro-life, to some extent; I almost understood Vera\'s motivations, especially regarding rape. In the 1950s, frivolous behavior was not as accepted as it is now, and Vera was there to be a friend. The movie is worth watching. Its historical importance in perspective is priceless.

"b""The websites that track the positive and negative reviews of the main critics register a positive score of at least 95% for Ratatouille, clearly putting it on top of the 2007 films. Is it the best movie of the year? No, but it is the one that has more appeal, since almost everyone will consider it a positive experience. Ratatouille follows Remy, a curious rat who aspires to be more than a garbage thief. The keen sense of smell and Remy's appreciation for food draw him to the culinary arts. By stealing what he can from an appreciation of homeowners for cooking shows and books, Remy becomes a devotee of one of France's most famous chefs, Auguste Gusteau. After Remy learns that Gusteau died years ago and that he had seen reruns of his television show, the little rat begins to be guided by Ben Kenobi with the spirit of the dead chef. Following the spirit eventually leads to the old Gusteau restaurant. which has been assumed by a naive capitalist who uses the image of Gusteau to sell frozen burritos and corndogs. By using a young kitchen worker as a medium, Remy tries to rebuild Gusteau's reputation and return his restaurant to his glory. The resulting action is an often charming story of a rat so dedicated to finding herself as achieving her goal. Many laughs are found when your family appears looking for brochures, and the main antagonists (the owner and a food critic) create real dramatic moments. Remy is really a `` hero '' movie, someone dedicated to a cause that he believes will make the world a better place. Although missing the heart of the Toy Story films or the comic brilliance of the first Shrek, Ratatouille continues the trend of the revival of animation that has provided some of the best films of the last decade.""",1

"b'What can I say about this uninspired ""recount"" of Bret\'s first novel? The film adaptation does not contain the scenes and the tone that I thought made the book so disturbing and memorable. (The dead child in the alley scene, the snuff film with the underage girl ...) This movie really can not be said to be based on the book, it is more because it is inspired by the novel. Despite this fall, the film is worth it for any admirer of Bret Easton Ellis, if only to satisfy curiosity. The film does not contain either the perfectly depressing verses or the deliciously disturbing minor characters that make the book so interesting and attractive (Clay\'s sisters, Spin) The film made it seem that Julian was the protagonist, while I always thought the novel it consisted of seeing the events through Clay\'s eyes. One of the most endearing parts of the novel are Clay\'s ""flashbacks"" of a better moment, before going to school. The movie only touches this at the beginning, and the flashback is about Blair, not about his parents, who were the subjects of the flashbacks that I found most interesting. The lunch scene between Clay and his father is pure genius. The detachment between father and son made me tremble physically. This scene is not included at all in the movie. The unfortunate thing about adapting the films in the books is that almost always something is lost in the ""translation"". \'American Psycho\' is really the only one of the films adapted from his books that I feel captures the tone of the book while simultaneously compacting it into a narrative that can be seen without losing Bret\'s style, and this is due to the fact that Bateman himself is the narrator. Everything and everything, \'Less Than Zero\' is not a bad movie, really. Only a bad adaptation. Capture what was amazing and forgettable from the popular movie of the 80s, and fits any entertaining youth drama of that era (including the extravagant use of cocaine by minors, too New Wave, the star of Where Are They Now? James Spader). There are some poignant moments, but it seems as if the film tried to find a conclusion that the book did not have (and had a reason not to do so). After all, Julian does not die in the novel, and Blair certainly does not return to Camden with Clay (Morrissey would not be proud). How melancholy is the novel? also alludes: how upset, apathetic and lost Clay is now that he has changed and acquired a new perspective, while his friends, unfortunately, no. And one serious complaint: where is the Disappear Here billboard? It is an integral part of the images of the novel, and is absent in the film (unless I missed it). All and all: If you are a fan of Bret\'s books, give this film a chance. It\'s worth seeing once, but do not worry if you\'re just trying to capture the mood or purpose of the novel.'",0

I was eight years old. It may have been his glacial beauty, his unforgivable disdain or his ability to turn adult men into clay and disappear on the spot. I do not know . She died in chapter 13. It is an ignominious death in a tacky suburb of Mars. Worse still, it was at the hands of their own guards. I only know that if I had been there, it would have turned out differently. The computer has presented magic beyond their dreams. I could get this DVD and look for my Queen. Queen Azura was played by Beatrice Roberts. The actress was born in Manhattan in 1905. As a young woman, she participated in several beauty pageants, including Miss America. He had a short-term marriage with Robert Ripley [Believe it or not], and a long-term relationship with Louis B. Mayer [MGM]. She appeared in a series of B-grade movies [maybe C], often uncredited. I still carry a torch for her. In truth, she would be as old as my grandmother. On the screen, however, she retains a real appeal. Beatrice Roberts finally disappeared into the darkness and is apparently buried in Plymouth, Massachusetts, near my hometown. If I ever find his grave, I'll stop and plant some violets.""",1

"b'When I came across Across the Universe, it seemed a little esoteric, even with the musical pedigree of the Beatles. But from the first minute when Jim Sturgess sings ""Chica"", everything makes sense. You have to really respect how well the musical legacy of the Beatles has been woven into this effort. Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr made the best music of the 20th century and, besides being a good movie, Across the Universe really focuses on it. The power of the songs comes alive at all times. Unconsciously imagined with a beautiful direction of art and cinematography, Across the Universe skillfully interweaves the Beatles in the socio-political context of the times in which the songs were written. Congratulations to the director Julie Taymor and the team, who clearly thought very well, and the excellent cast, who sing better than anyone would expect. This is quite a feat, considering that it could have gone wrong or done wrong. Actor Sturgess reminds me of a young Paul McCartney, but that\'s where the resemblance to anything from the Beatles ends. It\'s a pity that Across the Universe has not been successful in theaters, but I suspect the treatment may have been too smart. for today\'s audiences. It\'s a movie that comes from the heart that every Beatles fan should watch and the curious music see.'",1
"b'Amazon continues to combine movie reviews. There are approximately half a dozen DVD versions of ""The Snows of Kilimanjaro."" Amazon combines all these reviews, so whether you get a DVD with excellent quality or terrible quality, all those reviews apply to all versions of the DVD are available for sale. I bought the most expensive `` The Snows of Kilimanjaro (remastered edition) \'\' and the quality is terrible. It seems that the movie was filmed through a dirty window. The DVD case has a black border and shows Ava Gardner and Gregoty Peck sitting at the table. Avoid this version! Now I will try to buy other versions of this Amazon movie. I hope to find the only and good one. I read all the other reviews and could not reliably determine what the official version of the study is. Amazon\'s policy of combining film criticism is a financial waste and detrimental to the environment. UP: Buy the one with the red / brown border, (the mountain peaks are visible on Ava Gardner and Gregoty Peck on the cover of the box). This DVD looks great! !'",0
"b'First, I want to thank all the reviewers here. It is his reviews of this fine film that tempted me to buy it (that, and the fact that the director also did `` Breaker Morant \'\' - one of my favorites). I am a great admirer of this genre. I loved `` Dances with Wolves \'\' and `` Jeremiah Johnson \'\', and I really enjoyed `` The Last of the Mohicans \'\' and `` Last of the Dogmen \'\', however, none of these excellent films compares to the absolute realism represented in ""Black Robe"". This is a simple story set in the early seventeenth century ... a story of a French Jesuit priest who has been accused by his superiors of going canoeing to a Huron post 1,500 miles away (with the help of Indian explorers and a interpreter) and helps convert the Huron Indians to Christianity, thus saving their souls. In this film, the protagonist is not a superhero who does not make mistakes, shows no weaknesses, can shoot and go out with any man alive. On the contrary, he is just a young priest full of self-righteousness, ignorance, fear and doubt. But despite this (or because of this), his courage is truly incomparable. This is a story of real people who fight for their lives every day against the awesome hardness of nature and against other Indian tribes. This is also a story about the clash between two very varied cultures. This is shown with a mysterious subtlety, but the effects are devastating. `` Black Robe \'\' goes where few movies have gone before, or since. It\'s a film worthy of an Oscar like any I\'ve seen. The cinematography is grim, cold and implacable, as is the story. Between 1 and 10, I give this emblematic movie a solid 9. It really is one of my favorites.'",1
b'Remember how a single positive evaluation was ever made on April 5 or April 11? And do you notice how this movie is the only one that you have ever reviewed on Amazon? Is not it vaguely suspicious? I guess the only way to sell a shitty movie is to post fake reviews.',0
"b'This is a flagrant swindler on the part of Amazon, which plays with the current popularity of Bradley Cooper and hopes that nobody investigates beyond the preview of 2 minutes that is connected to find out about the movie. Later I discovered that the film is an independent film that was made in 2002. The worst part was that they charged an HD quality price of $ 4.99 for a low budget grainy film. The protagonist is a young woman who grew up in a carnival where it is the norm to create an illusion and tear off the offspring, and that is exactly what I feel happened here!'",0
"b""This had to be the most painful DVD experience I've had. The music on this DVD was so idiotic that it drowned out everything, making it completely incomprehensible. Equally as bad as the music, the producer seemed to want to see the video of him walking on almost every plane. Not to mention that almost the entire DVD is composed of collages of images superimposed one on top of the other, which makes none of them clear enough to see correctly. I have bought hundreds of books and DVDs from Amazon and this is the first one that has motivated me to publish a review. It's that bad. I can not even comment on what the producer said, I could not hear any of that. Stay away would be my advice, a total loss of money.""",0
"b""I enjoy good Asian films, especially when Takeshi Kaneshiro is in one, but he is not in this movie! I did not see Aaron either. I would really like to have read the comments before buying them and I will do so from now on, just to make sure the characters are in the movie. Now, who would have thought it necessary? Of course, I could say from the cover that he was not going to be the main character, which I thought was fine, but I realized that it is not the caliber of the actor that is no longer in the cover. Is it possible that when they say that the film is Takeshi's they mean that it was produced? I am so disoriented and upset with your deceptive information that I could almost scream. If they had not lied about the cast, I would not have bought this at all. Obviously it is a television drama edited rather badly with a lot of action, including the handsome actors and a somewhat confusing plot. If it's a continuation, I guess it explains some of the problems because people appear and the main characters know them, but we have no idea who they are or if they are bad or good, although we assume that they must be friends or enemies or both depending on their Actions. At one point, everyone is on par with the Power Rangers forming a giant sword and had no idea who they were or how Wind even came working to help the bad guy. I also did not realize that Wave was Cloud's brother (I think) until much later in the story. It would have been much more exciting if I had known from the beginning, but maybe because I was so bored, it had happened to me in some way! ? When Wind becomes a demon, there is no explanation about how long or when it changes back to normal or even how. He is with Mung, his wife, one minute and then the next, adopts a child and then never sees him again until it is his signal to inadvertently warn him that the teacher has a cold. It's just a bunch of scenes together that leave you wondering how he did it. I would not recommend this movie at all. It is filmed more like a telenovela, it has that video and it is simply edited horribly. I was bored waiting to see when Takeshi appeared thinking that maybe he was the anonymous one, but he could not even find out who the nameless one was. Maybe if they had continued with that, whoever they wanted as the anonymous, could have given more than one blow. A perfect way to waste your time.""",0
"b'Lewis Gilbert\'s 1983 masterpiece, a sensitive and emotionally satisfying adaptation of Willy Russel\'s clever and insightful two-character work. Gilbert and Russel would join again for the wonderful & quot; Shirley Valentine, & quot; but his work in this movie is unparalleled. Michael Caine offers one of the most memorable performances in an illustrious career, disappearing in his character Frank, and Julie Walters is magnificent as Rita / Susan. The music of David Hentschel is perfectly appropriate, Frank Watts\' cinematography is inspired, the script is moving and honest, but the magic of this film is in the interaction between the two main characters. This film captures the path to self-awareness embodied in education, as Rita / Susan\'s character develops from hairdresser to student, intellectual, diligent and finally to someone very different at the beginning of the film, but undeniable and still unique "". Rita. & Quot; The greatest gift that a person can give to another person is the love of learning, and that is why I believe that this is one of the best love stories that has been devoted to celluloid. as inevitable as tragedy, & quot; in the words of Willy Russel, but the relationship between Frank and Rita made his emotional journey worthwhile, and we are all richer for his journey.'",1
"b""If Daniel Barenboim is not the best living classical musician in the world, he is certainly the most versatile. In a career spanning more than 50 years, his name is attributed to many of the famous recordings of opera, symphony, small ensemble and solo piano. With the later half of his career marked by distinction on the podium, one can forget that he is still a concert pianist. Here we have both talents while Barenboim conducts the Staatskapelle Berlin and plays the five piano concertos of Beethoven. From the attached brochure we find that Barenboim first recorded these works in 1967 at the age of 24 under Otto Klemperer. Now he revisits them 40 years later on the occasion of his 65th birthday. The challenges of serving as conductor and soloist are undoubtedly considerable, but Barenboim, acting entirely by memory and without score, makes it seem simple and natural. Even while fully committed to his role as a soloist, Barenboim never loses control of the orchestra. Sometimes his direction is in the momentary freedom of a sweeping gesture of his left hand. At other times, it is the subtlety of his assent or the swiftness of his eye. The Staatskapelle is perfectly adapted to these nuances and its interpretation is always chord and never faltering. Among the many highlights: the wonderful exchange between piano and clarinet in the Largo of the first concert, an exciting narrative of the Rondo Vivace in the final movement of the fourth and all the beauty and majesty of the Emperor. The performance was recorded before a live audience during a three-day piano festival in Bochum, Germany in 2007. The concerts took place at the Jahrhunderthalle, which presents an architectural design of a converted steel factory. The minimalist interior with high ceilings and exposed steel beams gives up the traditional elegance that adorns many concert halls (and the suffocating pretension that accompanies it). Aesthetically, the Jahrhunderthalle stands out as a place that emphasizes the comfort and cleanliness of the lines of vision above all else. The exhausted public thanks and respects the music. They are often in view, but they are rarely heard (even between movements) until their applause at the end of each job. They are elegantly dressed people (if not formally) who know good classical music when they listen to it. Some of the performances took place during the day allowing the large rear windows to project a magnificent natural light on the public and the performers more illuminated by the soft lighting of the stage that highlights the musicians and their instruments where necessary and without hard shadows. The 1080i Blu-ray image is almost perfect. The skin tones are natural and attractive. The color of the instruments and the attire of the audience is precise without bleeding. The ivory keyboard is correctly exposed and balanced with a lot of resolution to see the distinction between the keys. The black levels are strong without losing any detail in the folds of the musicians jacket. The close-ups reveal the polished brass of the French horns, as well as the fine grain on the basses and violins. Barenboim is appropriately the center of attention and we can see the delicate scrolls of her hair and the beads of sweat that begin to shine on her forehead for the third movement of each concert. The PCM 2.0 audio track is clean, but the piano sounds slightly loud above the high C. On the contrary, the DTS HD-MA 5.1 track, when opening the environment of the rear channels and a wider sound stage, It offers a beautiful, warm and spacious sound, and without any discordance in the upper register. The piano is correctly centered while the sonic integrity of each orchestral instrument is presented with distinction according to its location on the stage. The full program runs at approximately 3:20. There are no supplements except for a handful of trailers from other Medici Arts releases. An interview with Barenboim, some rehearsal images and a brief history of the place would have been nice, but unfortunately missed opportunities. In the end, that's the only thing missing since it is, in any other way, a very welcome release and another great achievement for one of the most distinguished artists of classical music.""",1

"b""I will admit that I have never seen Mario Bava movies. I recently entered the Italian cinema with the films of Dario Argento and other Giallo in my interest. Until now, I had never tried any Bava. So when I listened to this movie and was intrigued with the premise, I picked up the DVD. The premise of the film is that four criminals steal the payroll of pharmaceutical companies during which the driver of the escape is killed. The three remaining assassins flee to a parking lot taking hostages, one of which they kill to escape. Then, in order not to be discovered by the police in a family car, they retire and take more hostages, this time a middle-aged man and a sick child. At this point, the movies have been a film of violent crimes. When he gets in the car, the film focuses basically on the handling of the criminals and their hostages. What is good in the film despite minor flaws is that even in its form (neither Rabid Dogs nor the Kidnapped Reissue was completed with Bava's support due to circumstances that gained their status as 'lost' until recently) It's really good thriller of suspense mounted building your tension slowly. As tensions rise in the car and victims advocate for their lives, even criminals begin to turn on each other. One wants to rape the woman as a hostage, while another follows what happens while the leader is more concerned about reaching his destination. There are moments in the film that were great for me in a transgressive way that newer movies could not even reach. And in the end, I do not want to ruin it, but if you get into the plot as much as I do, it will definitely surprise you. I was totally impressed by the movie. One thing is also the sense of anger that filters from each frame. This is a brutal movie to watch sometimes with his portrayal of a world that is vain and arrogant and quite brutal when considering the plight of the hostages (especially the child). For me it is a film that could almost compare with one of my favorites, Kurosawa's Ran. Unfortunately, I've only seen the cut of Rabid Dogs on the new Anchor Bay album. It also contains the edition of Lamberto Bava hijacked more in line with the intentions of his father, which I will see in the future, but it went out for the synthesizer's score (I love the harpsichord and the blaring organs in Rabid Dogs, although it's true that the score is incessant) and did not want to see the movie so soon after seeing it. This is still a definite recommendation from me, it's worth seeing.""",1
"b'Being a big fan of the vampire / terror and fan of the videogames Bloodrayne, I decided to give a twist to this film. All I can say is ouch. The action scenes are laughable. The actors move in slow motion as if they had no coordination. I guess this is due to a low budget wrestling choreographer. And the blood! This movie has to have the most fictitious-looking blood ever seen ... It\'s hard to give this movie two stars for its superior violence.

The soundtrack of the music was simply wonderful: each song matched each scene so perfectly. I was lucky to get a copy of the soundtrack during a trip abroad. In any case, it seemed to me that the plot was much more attractive and intelligent than its standard Hollywood movies. Instead of Sugiyama falling in love with the original girl who attracted him to the ballroom, he discovers the sheer joy of dancing and his liberating power that brought him closer to his family by encouraging him to show his affection and love more openly. directly.

"b'While it is true that the once brilliant `` Soap \'\' suffers from large terminal problems of creativity in its fourth and final season (why is Burt suddenly the healthiest member of the family?), Today it practically exceeds all comedies in the air. his daring mix of comedy, drama, romance, suspense and pathos. The fourth season offers many memorable television moments, if less than the previous three seasons, including Burt\'s crisis of faith, El Puerco and his son\'s hilarious introduction to the family, Chester\'s moving and far too late realization that he loves Jessica, Dutch and the tacky wedding of Eunice, and Mary\'s struggle to maintain her sanity in the midst of true madness. Today, even the ""Soap"" is not even close to this one, its weakest season. What Sony has done in the fourth season is frightening and a mystery. While their Seasons One to Three presentations were technically unremarkable, much of that due to the original materials, at least the episodes remained intact and were presented as they were originally on ABC and the VHS release of the Columbia House series in the 1990s For some reason, Sony opted to edit the fourth season of `` Soap \'\' by cutting out most of the summaries prior to the episode (`` In the last episode of \'Soap\' ... \'\'), some of which they were quite intelligent and none of which consumed more than 40 or less seconds of time. Worse still, Sony has edited the last five episodes of an hour of the season in ten half hours, omitting full scenes and essentially including heavily edited syndicated versions of the final stage of the series. (I do not know if these are the syndicated versions of these episodes, but they are significantly different from the episodes, as they appeared on the Columbia House tapes, which offered uncut episodes as they appeared on ABC in 1981). full and complete versions of \'\' Soap \'\' Seasons 1-3, this poor quality and incomplete packaging of season 4 is an enigma, a disappointment and value only for fans who only have to have the entire series on DVD. Otherwise, the true fans of the unedited, unedited series should cling, or find, the last year of `` Soap \'\' on VHS and suffer the inferior quality until Sony justifies it.'",0

It is more a film about a woman who does not get along with her mother, is popular on her radio show and her marriage is in trouble.

An exchange between two hostages for trying to see the television cameras during one of the visits of Idi Amin. All scenes show the release of non-Israeli hostages returning home. - A Catholic nun who insisted on staying with the rest of the hostages.

"b""Currently, this is the only version of Nobody 's Fool available on DVD. The fact that you get a double undercard from Paul Newman for the same price as a single title is just a bonus. Nobody is a fool is one of my favorite dramas and one of the last great roles of Newman, since his luck Sully. The whole cast shines; You could say that this is the best work you've seen of Melanie Griffith and Bruce Willis. If we add to this the final role of Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jessica Tandy, winner of an Oscar before the Oscar, will have a film that should not be missed and a treasure of its own. I like Richard Russo's books. I'm a fan of Mohawk, Nobody 's Fool and the winner of the Pulitzer Prize Empire Falls. The last book was translated into an HBO miniseries, Empire Falls, which surprisingly also includes performances by Paul Newman and Philip Seymour Hoffman. However, Newman won only one Oscar, as Best Actor for his role in The Color of Money in 1986. However, Newman exudes a charm as informal as Sully in Nobody 's Fool, which is still my favorite of the two. Rating: Five stars.P.S. I'm not a big fan of `` Fat Man & Little Boy ''.

"b""This training was great. I completed it 15 minutes ago and I can definitely feel it now. The training is divided into 5 segments of 10 minutes, which is a format that I love, because it means that you can decompose it for a shorter training and, even if you do everything, it does not seem like an eternity due to the changes segments. The general idea is to do strengthening exercises followed by stretching to lengthen the muscles. Overview of the segments: Weapons: this was probably my least favorite segment. I prefer the arm segment in 10 minute perfect body pilates solutions. They were around 6-7 minutes of work with arms and then 3-4 of stretching arms. He felt rushed and the indication seemed a little discouraged. Also, I just did not find it very difficult. For this segment you need light weights. High: this segment was excellent. They claim that you need a chair to do these exercises, however, if you have reasonably strong thighs and a good balance, it is not necessary. These exercises make you feel your thighs, mine began to tremble like crazy at one point and are really effective. Buttocks: I think this was the most difficult segment of the DVD. I really like that they had a segment dedicated especially to the glutes, a lot of videos with thighs and I do not think they work much. In this segment, the glutes will work hard, and a chair is an absolute necessity. I had to take several breaks during the same, but I am willing to work up to the entire segment. Absolutely: I'm happy that this segment was short because, although it was a good job for the abs, it was a bit boring. You put your feet on the wall and you keep in a position of abs (do not think it sounds difficult, I did not try to do it for about 8 minutes) and then I made variations from there. It's not my favorite ab training but it's effective, I definitely felt my abs straining. Stretching: I really like it when DVDs have a specific long segment dedicated to stretching. That said, this was not my favorite stretch segment. I wish the sections would have been a little less long and there would have been more different sections. He finished and still felt the need to do other stretches to feel really stretched. But the stretches they did were good, and there's something to be said to keep them going for so long and really make your body relax in the stretch. In general, I definitely recommend buying this video. It's a really effective workout and I certainly liked all the segments enough to keep doing it even if they were not my favorites. I also liked that they had two instructors, a man and a woman, and they showed simpler variations of many of the movements, even when it was better to rest if you needed it. A scam that I have not yet mentioned (and this is a matter of personal preference) is that the instruction is a voiceover that is not my favorite and sometimes I felt that the indication was not correct. Final thought: for $ 15 it's worth it!""",1

The DVD version seems to be clean of the TV version in terms of quality. I seem to remember more ""fuzzies"" in the background when I was on TV (maybe the DVD was remastered?) The claymation video of Desinty \'s Child is basically useless, in my opinion, unless you have a little fan of this type . of music (and I do not). With a run time of 65 minutes, this DVD has hardly any extras. There is a lost scene that originally went on the air instead of the song `` Why am I so misfit? \'\' (an optimistic melody about attacking and finding your fortune). You can also watch the DVD in Spanish, and my son gets a kick to do it from time to time. The `` previews \'\' for other DVDs, including an annoying promotion for one on Peter Rabbit / Easter, seems ENDLESS. It\'s a shame how they announce to death on DVD for young people! And as for the story of Rudolph: well, it always bothered me that Rudolph\'s father rejected him for being different, and also Santa himself! Very disappointing, but is not that how life, where people judge according to appearances? Still, I love the songs about Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer, and Hermie, the dentist he wants to be, Yukon Cornelius and the Bumble bring a warm festive nostalgia to our house. And my 7 year old son plays this DVD at least once a day! What more can you ask? (except maybe some fun extras).'",1
"b""After their first year of college, the gang gathers again to relax and have fun. After a party in Stiflers, which resembles almost exactly the first film, the gang decides to take their adventures to a beach house and spend the summer there. While trying to find jobs and organize parties on the beach, the boys have to deal with some of their own dilemmas. Jim discovers that Nadia is back in the United States after she was fired from them after her internet debacle. However, Jim has only had sex one and a half times since that incident. So, to try to prepare for Nadia, she takes the help of Michelle, the geek gang that shook her world for a year. When she begins to teach him the forms of sexual behavior, they themselves begin to realize that maybe they are more than they think they are for each other. Kevin, after separating from Vicky, has to overcome his feelings for her once he shows up at the house to have fun. Because for her, they're just friends, and that's why she now has a new boy in her life. Oz has to deal with a long distance relationship with Heather since she left for the summer. However, it does not help that your best friend, Stifler, is constantly trying to have sex with any girl less than 3 yards from them. Speaking of Stifler, he's still dealing with the fact that Finch had sex with his mother last year. And Finch is having recalls of not being with Stifler's mother. For a long time, I thought that part 1 was the best of these 2. I seriously believe that I have been wrong all this time. After seeing them back the night before, I can honestly tell you that I laughed a lot more with part 2. The jokes are better and even more spicy. The embarrassing situations that Jim goes through are hilarious (my God, the super glue scene). The girls are hotter. And Stifle maybe just a little on the top, but it's still much better in part 2. When he grabs that dildo and shakes it while running through that house, I could not stop laughing. And when he says he forgot where he found it, it was the cause of all the excitement when he found out it was just funny. The lesbian scene just laughed graciously too. In the end, you would definitely own this. But remember, if you do not like coarse and rude comedy, stay away.P.S. - There is no way that any heterosexual man had left the house of light without having done something with Nadia. No way.""",1
"b""Alice Walker is a great pioneer. She is one of those African-American women who deserves all our love and adoration. She explores in this film, and behind it in the book, the slow and progressive liberation of black women from their slave slavery. Everything must start in their heads. They must find the courage to develop their own personality and freedom in the closed jail of their skulls, and then, little by little, they find the strength and the power to resist men, and then society, and then to overcome them . Liberation is a mental process that finds its full power when it is made public and views society as the natural field of its realization. The film is moving, moving, sensitive, intelligent, sentimental and tremendously powerful, if it is not pregnant with the most universal language we can imagine, the language of the liberation of women seen as the first step of the liberation of humanity. Alice Walker is universal in this story and deals with everyone and with every human being. What's more, no one is lost, no one is abandoned on the side of the road, no one is wasted forever for the cause of liberation. Even the worst tyrant will find in his moral depth the idea and the initiative that will make him free along with others, along with those whom he has exalted for decades. The husband pays the immigration of the African husband and family of his wife's sister. And he does it for nothing, because he stays on the sidelines and does not claim what belongs to him. Salvation is for all or it will not be. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.""",1
"b'First, I must clarify. The first time I saw Full Metal Jacket in its original theatrical version. Especially what remained with me was the scene in the head that ends the second third of the film. I bought it on the recommendation of my son, a newly commissioned second lieutenant of the Marines. He calls FMJ the `` Marine Movie. ""It also calls the period of time"" a shameful chapter in the history of the Marine Corps. ""The routine abuse of the recruits represented in the film does not happen anymore, but the film is right in both aspects, and maritime training, even thirty years later, is as demanding as Kubrick describes. `` Indestructible men (and now, women) \'\' who can kill as many enemies as possible.The experience of Marines in combat, especially in Vietnam, is as the film demonstrates.As it undergoes a training that He will train him to lead a platoon, I asked my son about the incident that leads to the second death in cold blood, could it have happened that the Marines would be so lost that they would be at the mercy of a sniper? Absolutely, he replied, adding that Marines see the prospect of urban war with fear: ""There are an infinite number of places where the enemy could be."" In addition, he said, Cowboy made the right decision, even though it turned out Although I was on the streets in a different way during Vietnam (and I could not have seen the fight anyway, I\'m blind in my right eye and in my right hand), I\'m convinced that Semper Fi is real. `Semper Fi, do or die, gung ho, gung, ho, gung ho.

He lives next to old Mr. Wilson, who is often the recipient of Dennis's curiosity. Meanwhile, a thief crosses the city and begins to steal the house.

"b'No one can soak a book in a spooky, damp atmosphere like Neil Gaiman, infused with humor and more than a little horror. Fortunately, that flavor remains alive in the film adaptation of `` Coraline \'\', brought to life by the talented Henry Selick. It\'s a scary little fairytale full of dilapidated apartments, dancing rats and soulless doppelgangers, as well as a brave heroine who finds himself in this ominous ""other"" world. Moved to an old apartment, Coraline (Dakota Fanning)) is boring. Her parents are too busy to do something with her, and her neighbors are crazy or bored. The only exception is Wybie, a boy who bothers her without end. It\'s the kind of implacably boring world that any little girl would want to escape, until Coraline does. She finds herself with a plastered door and a colorful wormhole, leading to a doppelganger back home. In fact, it is so similar that it has an ""other mother"" with button eyes (Teri Hatcher) and an ""other father"" (John Hodgman), in addition to good food, games, a gleaming magical garden, a chorus of circus rodents and magic toys. At first Coraline is fascinated by the other world, especially because her other parents are as attentive as her real ones are not. Then she finds her true parents sealed inside a mirror. With the help of a sarcastic cat, Coraline returns to the other world. But with her parents and a trio of children killed as hostages, Coraline\'s only hope is to bet on her own freedom, and she will be trapped forever if she fails. Neil Gaiman\'s book `` Coraline \'\' is a brilliant dark fairy tale environment: decaying apartments, dead children, cobwebs, beetles, disembodied hands, button eyes, and a woman with insect-button eyes who wants to claim Coraline for her. It is a fairytale world that becomes a nightmare kingdom where souls are lost and horrible things fall into the shadows. Most directors would turn the story into an uncomplicated matter ... but not the director of `` The Nightmare Before Christmas \'\' and `` James and the giant peach. ""Instead, Selick gives it a dark, cobwebby atmosphere, bright colors and surreal details (the button that outshines the moon) and is full of charming details that might have been foolish (the hand of the creepy claw) but that They work brilliantly.The story begins simply as surreal, but becomes more frightening and spooky as the film unravels, and in the last third, the slow story suddenly turns into a completely spooky territory, and a truly frightening climax where the Other Mother shows her true self And along the way, there are a lot of wonderfully spooky moments: the three ghosts in a bedroom / rotten mirror, the offer of buttons and thick black thread, strange circus acts and much more The horror is subtle, the delicious spooky is not. Coraline, the Alice in this Notsowonderland, is a wonderful little heroine: strong, sensible, self-sufficient but still quite scared by what happens around her. Normally I\'m not crazy about Dakota Fanning, but only by voice is quite good in this role. The sarcastic cat is a wonderful counterpoint, and the original character of the movie, Wybie, is a good companion (although strange). And the other mother is the subject of nightmares: she is completely inhuman and ruthless, and by the climax of the movie it has become a nightmare. Oh, and French and Saunders make a couple of funny cameos like crazy neighbors. `` Coraline \'\' is a brilliantly dark little movie, full of dark magic and mysterious creatures, definitely for Gaiman fans, dark fantasy and really spooky things.'",1
"b""In my review of the Fallen album, I quoted Lemmy from Motorhead saying that the album was above and beyond the line of duty. The rest of the appointment was that he felt they could not do it live. Well, I have to disagree with Mr. Kilminster for having seen the 'World Domination' tour in his Australian stage. I have to say that the band sounded perfect. And this CD shows that you can really fill the sound mix like in your advance album. This is really something unimportant in terms of audio. The sound is fine, the band is tight, which is interesting given the personal dramas of the time. The noise of the crowd seems to have been introduced and eliminated, although that is a fairly regular situation. The main difference between these Fallen songs and their live versions here is that the sound sounds a little deeper. It really is a work of cash in his fame. Taking out a live album when you have a catalog without backup is a bit cheeky. It also serves to fill the gap between their albums: the aforementioned personnel uprisings have undoubtedly played their part. It is not that filling the time between albums with live releases and curiosities is a new idea (G'n'R Lies anyone?). For fans of this band, this is probably essential to listen. The songs sound good, the crowd loves them properly and they are a nice project. Three stars for the strength of the songs and because it does not feel as if there have been massive overdoses. The fourth star of the extra DVD that shows the band is putting in value. However, they also sold the DVD separately for a while. Make sure you get this version with the DVD already in it, since it's really worth seeing.""",1
"b""4.6 starsI love this movie, and I think both the script and Ford do justice to the original and beloved television series. However, I do not think that this blu-ray transfer does much justice to the original impression; although it is a good and clear image, it does not improve my DVD much. The film itself is an excellent adaptation of the series, and Big Pharma's conspiracy angle is an excellent update that works well. There are many emotions, with minimal violence, which I appreciate more every year, as idiot directors and writers rely on weapons and blood to fill the gaps in their badly planned plots. There is more intelligence than that at work here, and director Andrew Davis makes everything fit with strength and suspense. The ending is a bit weak: I did not buy the scene at the conference, but it works to the degree that it should, and that is enough. Add Ford and Jones at the top of their games and it's a movie worth watching many times, every time you have to remember what a really good thriller can be. Too bad, they did not polish it enough to be a blu-ray worthy of the HD description.""",1
"b'The problem with New Moon is that it takes itself very seriously while giving the public many reasons to consider it a joke. I try not to read too much in the movies, and I think that people are responsible for their own actions, but I agree that this movie has an influence on young girls, and yes, older women too. Once I was in high school, and much of the dialogue was like what I remembered hearing between boyfriends and girlfriends. You know, on the day you fell in love a lot and were the love of your life? Then, 3 weeks later, BOTH you pass to another ""love of your life"". ""This is how the dialogue sounds. It\'s corny, exaggerated, and I\'m sorry for teenagers who think this is what it should be. Edward and Bella have an obsessive and codependent relationship. Abandoned by a vampire so you feel suicidal? For real ? If you take out vampire things, everything else is still wrong. Bella is a creature without personality, without emotions, without a sense of humor, without goals, completely empty of a girl. It\'s really hard to understand why any of these guys find her attractive. What she does ? For her or for someone? She is a great burden and treats her father like shit. It just is not credible that two guys are willing to die (one again) for her. She does not offer anything in return. She is abandoned by Ed and only eats the attention that Jacob pays her without any intention of reciprocating her feelings. We call that leader. Everything is about her to the fullest. What I find particularly entertaining is that he asks Jacob if he could stop being a wolf ... but this same girl would never ask Edward that. Has no sense . Lautner did the best performance of the three, and made me feel for Jake. I read the Wiki page of the book Breaking Dawn and the result for your character sounds like the recipe for a movie for disaster. At this point, producers must stop leading young girls. Honestly, he saved the movie. As an adult, I can only handle so much teenage anguish and the fact that he broke some smiles prevented me from turning it off. When the werewolf first came out of the forest before pursuing Victoria, that\'s fine, yes, I thought he was a bear. But still, the werewolf scenes were the best parts. The vampire makeup was terrible and the contacts distracted. Pattinson was better in the first movie. Stewart was the same non-entity. She was so unmatched. Even if it is not in the dialogue, gestures, facial expressions and actions can convey a lot about a character. It\'s hard to believe that Bella is not a robot. Even on the DVD cover, she just does not try it. Compared with both male clients. The actors should be able to sell the motivations of their characters. Stanley in `Streetcar \'was totally reprehensible, but Brando sold it. Stewart does not, and therefore, Bella is one of the most unworthy ""heroines"" in history. Never, I\'m not going to stop here.'",0
"b""Good movies about the & quot; Great War & quot; (as the First World War was known before there was a second) are few and far between. After & quot; All in silence on the western front & quot; and & quot; Paths of Glory & quot; the list is quite short This movie does not live up to those standards, but it's still an excellent movie. In general terms, the film is quite accurate in terms of its description of the combat of the First World War. The battle scenes come so close to & quot; Save Private Ryan & quot; level of realism as you can get on commercial television. Note that some scenes, especially the & quot; Friendly fire & quot; artillery attack, they are not for the apprehensive. The cast of support is a colorful and original collection of characters, devoid of most of the usual clich\xc3\xa9s of war movies. You could not look at a character and say if he would be dead or not by the end of the movie. It was easy to imagine that these characters had been ripped from a New York street around 1918. Rick Schroeder offers a first-class performance as Whittlesey's greatest conflict, divided between doing his duty and the well-being of his men. There are some moments where the movie hits a false note. Whittlesey's car at first was probably not built for 15 years after the Great War ended. The scene where the commander receives his orders seems to ignore the military protocol. And in a great failure of continuity, Whittlesey's executive office talks about the artillery shelling that had happened that day, when it had happened the previous day. These are only minor bumps in a first class effort.""",1
"b""Yes, Keanu Reeves actually plays the villain in this wonderful and magical film of romance, jealousy, romance, betrayal and honor set in Renaissance Italy. Created and starring Kenneth Branagh, this remake of one of Shakespeare's comedies is probably the most entertaining and fun movie based on one of Bard's plays. The cast includes many big names from both sides of the Atlantic, such as Denzel Washington, Emma Thompson and Michael Keaton, and the heroine is Kate Beckinsale's first great performance. The dialogue in the film remains true to the original work and the setting is probably as close as possible to what Shakespeare imagined. The best of everything is music; Classic style but original composition. I enjoyed watching this movie again and again, and so do you.""",1
"b""This DVD has my favorite soundtrack for this movie, however, it is not synchronized with the video! (which basically ruins it) The chapter selection also has flaws: there are only 4 chapter selections to choose from; Chapter 2 is labeled as Chapter 1, and so on ... so there is no selection for Chapter 1. The title menu is also extremely cheap, showing a small photo of the cover of the DVD box on a background that resembles very much the old Windows 95 'blue sky with clouds'. Last, and certainly not least, the quality of the video is terrible. Probably not worth it unless you are planning to remaster the DVD with the soundtrack in sync with the video for personal use and with a decent chapter selection menu. . I hope to find that someone has already put a good version along with this soundtrack on dvd (I know it exists in vhs).""",0
"b""These days Uwe Boll has become a kind of joke among fans of the genre. With titles like Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead on his r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9, the German director has become synomynous with hack work crapfests. The seals of the weakest can be of the horror genre. I suppose it is a little insensitive that we, the fans, taste so much the pursuit of Boll's attacks, but if the man did not try to force excuses and defend his work in the interviews, he would be much more willing to reduce it. It is one thing to make a terrible film and defend it through a delusional assumption that it is somehow good, but another is to try to cover yourself when you know you are making a mess. I patiently await the half-hearted defenses of Bloodrayne's Uwe. As in all these half-done, video game rapidies, the plot is irrelevant. That does not mean that you could not produce a story of offspring on the character of Rayne, but it certainly was not good. The script is the first culprit. It appears as something that I wrote in the tenth grade English class. All imaginable clich\xc3\xa9s are on display. It's as if screenwriter Guinevere Turner had an encyclopedia of banalities. I suppose the excuse could be that she is new to these types of pieces, but let's go. The world has no meaning and is full of things incongruent with its old world environment. But in spite of these anachronisms, the dialogue is nothing more than harsh and antiquated words with a comic aversion to the contractions in sentences. The various plot machinations that provide the impetus for the actions of the characters always remain vague and irrelevant. There is very little here for the actors to work on. It is not that they try hard. Nobody here seemed to give a shit, which is understandable. However, there is humor in the delivery of clumsy and forced lines of many of the actors. It almost seemed as if some of them, (Michael Madsen and Michele Rodriquez most obviously), were reading the dialogue on a reference card for the first time. Udo Kier and Billy Zane have useless scrolls (although Zane manages to give some of their peculiar qualities). Ben Kingsley basically sits in the same chair for three quarters of the movie, barely reacting to anything they tell him. And Meatloaf, well ... I find myself somewhat bewildered by his short sequence in the film. All I'll say is that it was a wig of a demon. Let's see ... was there something good? I will say that Kristanna Loken is definitely hot. It is difficult to say if he can act because there is no dialogue worthy of reciting and no director capable of pushing it in the direction of an act, but it definitely resembles Rayne. The blood spilled, particularly in the unclassified version, is quite vivid, albeit a bit clumsy and unconvincing. There's a great troll ... that was never explained ... and ... uh ... ah, hell, I just wish someone would give Uwe Boll some professional advice. Maybe he could be a choreographer of fight scenes, he likes those, or he could try to be a production assistant, go back to the top, relearn how to make a movie. Hell, it could be a dumpster. As far as I'm concerned, someone just tells you to stop making movies. In that way, all of humanity could benefit.""",0

"b'Forbidden Planet is perhaps the preeminent work of the scientific fantasy of the fifties. It is not, far from it, difficult science fiction, but in its way it is a thoughtful and intelligent offer. Famous (but very vaguely) based on Shakespeare\'s ""The Tempest"", this is a film where there are as many potential layers of meaning as you want to find. With Morbius chosen as Prospero, and Prospero in turn probably based on the Elizabethan wizard Dr. John Dee, co-creator of Enochian\'s magical language, is it really a coincidence that Morbius is himself a linguist? There\'s a lot more I\'d like to say here, but I\'m lagging behind for the sake of those who are not familiar with the movie. I do not want to give away any spoilers. For those who have seen the film, and who feel inclined towards such exercises, I will only ask this: to whom - or what - would they assign the respective roles of Ariel and Caliban? How would you fit your answers with the broader themes of the movie? And what do your answers suggest about how matter and spirit were conceived respectively in the minds of the Elizabethans versus the Americans of the 1950s? Only something to think about. For those who have not yet seen Forbidden Planet, I would say first of all that this is a wonderful movie that works perfectly well at the level of a direct adventure that a 10 year old could enjoy. As a piece of science fiction, I only emphasized that the depths you will find are of philosophy rather than science; although the classic technological themes of science fiction of the fifties are developed metaphorically. Happily, however, the reds under the bed / saucers in the sky metaphor that became a clich\xc3\xa9 and eacute; In much of the science fiction of the day nothing is found. One thing I want to add before going on is that it\'s worth watching this movie just for the set design. If you consider it classic or outdated, it\'s up to you; but for me I will simply say that I have never seen the visual lexicon of science fiction of the 1950s expressed more fully. Alright then: so much for the movie. How about the DVD? Well, I\'m happy to say it\'s amazing! The quality of the image is beautiful, and there are LOADS of extras and also very good. We get lots of vintage promotional material, which includes behind-the-scenes background material and even an additional movie for children that Robbie the Robot also used as an accessory. By the way, because I\'ve seen some criticisms that I\'ve written appear for editions or releases that are not for those who originally wrote them, let me emphasize that I\'m writing all this about Forbidden Planet (Special Edition of two albums). If you look at my profile Critical, you\'ll see that I\'m not one of those critics who delivers five-star raves as candy. But if you have any interest in classical science fiction, this is a movie you MUST see. And if you\'re looking for the best possible DVD version, to the best of my knowledge, that\'s the way it is.

Of course it does not make sense if you're talking about something like this happening in real life (well, maybe yes, but the bus would have exploded at the beginning of your trip) but for entertainment value, this movie is very high in the balance . Dennis Hopper was a wonderful villain and the characters are very nice. I want to take a great look at the audio part of Blu Ray: turn up the sound when you see it because the quality is really impressive. Very realistic, nothing exaggerated. The dialogue is clear and the film makes good use of a surround sound system. The video is good, considering the age of the film. The audio is simply excellent.""",1

Basically it looks like they punctured this copy of a mutilated 16mm projector. The print has a bad cog effect that causes the image to shake on the screen. It seems that they used the bulb of an easy cooking oven to project this impression. Calling the muddy image would be a compliment. All life and color have been absorbed by this movie. I mentioned that the movie was not even focused. The sound was also pretty bad, but I'm not very audiophile to really talk about that. Do yourself a favor and look for the VHS version.

"b""Donald O'Connor plays Aladdin as the hero and the comic relief in this Arab night fantasy. Conspicuously American in a cast that seems largely European, O'Connor's Aladdin has humble beginnings but never allows his lack of means (or any concrete idea to acquire any) to dampen his dreams of greatness. When he discovers that his new lamp contains a genie that will grant him three wishes, his opportunity for greatness may finally have come true. No one believes him, least of all the lovely Djalma, who has spent years waiting for him to abandon his dreams, settle down and marry her. Assured of his deepest desires, Aladdin travels to Basorah, a large nearby city, which already celebrates the impending marriage of the sultan's daughter to the young but wise Molook. Meanwhile, the evil vizier of the prince conspires to kill Mollook and steal both his crown and his bride and, without male heirs of the sultan, the sultan's crown as well. When he stumbles upon the plan, Aladdin carries out an unlikely rescue with the help of the cunning prince and the population of fakir and beggars of Basorah. It was a funny movie and for some reason overlooked. It's fine for children, not very violent (except for two scenes, both involving a doll made to look like a real and exotic beautiful woman, and designed to crush to death those who are wrong in their embrace) and manages to see Very Hollywood and also very convincingly Arab at the same time.

"b'* \'\' The Defiant Ones \'\' is one of those rare movies that, after being seen only once, had the ability to stay with me for a lifetime! (Other gems that have had a similar effect on me include Chaplin\'s first \'talkie\', `` The Great Dictator \'\', the original `` Night of the Living Dead \'\', the corny and horrible but fun science fiction cult movie `` Laserblast \'\', and `` Citizen Kane \'\' by Orson Welles). I just had the opportunity to buy the DVD and watch this movie for the second time, and it was as good and intense as I remember from the first time! \'\' The Defiant Ones \'\' brings together the legendary Tony Curtis and the equally legendary and talented Sidney Poitier as convicted felons John `` Joker \'\' Jackson and Noah Cullen who, as a result of a physical skirmish between the two, contribute in part of the road accident in which your transport vehicle is involved. The resulting accident gives these two prisoners in chains the opportunity to escape on foot. But this is before the 60s of the southern United States, so when the law enforcement officers who arrive responsible for tracking the prisoners discover that the two conspirators escaped together have different racial backgrounds, they become somewhat negligent in their search, assuming erroneously that the two escaped would probably kill each other out of racial hatred before they even reach five miles. Forced to cooperate despite the racial tensions between them, Joker and Noah do not take their situation lightly and are constantly on the move to stay as far away from their persecutors as possible. In the days that follow, both men form a kind of uncomfortable camaraderie, and the conversations they engage with each other really seem to help soften some of those racial tensions they exhibit with each other, where each man gains a certain amount of respect for the other. . Joker is also made to face some unpleasant realities, like being forced to admit in his heart that Noah is the more rational of the two and, especially, having to accept the fact that his white skin is not a safety net when he is a fugitive criminal fleeing. There is also a story of \'human interest\' in the secondary plot of the film, part of it somewhat ahead of its time: the County Sheriff becomes the catalyst that prevents the persecution from becoming a careless and messy `` Good Ol \'Boy\' \'pistols, dawgs and testosterone, and one of the people of the village, played by the legendary Lon Chaney Jr., prevents the citizenship of a city from becoming an emotionally irrational lynch mob. Cinematography is excellent for a film of its time, although some of the sets could have been better constructed and arranged (for example, there is a set where the lights of the city of Los Angeles shine in the background beyond the studio lot). It\'s also nice to hear actors speaking with Southern accents that do not sound like ""Foghorn Leghorn"" rejects. Even considering `` remaking \'\' this classic movie would not only be a terrible mistake, but would also be a virtual impossibility ... so I hope that no one in Hollyweird, or anywhere else, thinks about doing something like that. One thing, and so let this great piece of the history of film making stand on its own and continue to stand the test of time. * * *'",1
"b'Unless you can laugh at schlock terror, whether you\'re a big fan of Louis Gossett Jr., or an admirer of Richard Karn (aka ""Home Improvement""), you probably do not like this movie at all. It creeps at a slower pace than a snail in hibernation. Dialogue is really, really, bad. This is one of those movies that you know the only reason why the actors, directors, producers and anyone else associated with the movie did it was for the money. Richard Karn offers some laughs as an oscillator, bachelor, archaeologist and LG Jr. is a bit frightening at times (not because of his character, but because of his excess of emotions). However, most of the time everyone in the movie has these & quot; how I ended here & quot; or & quot; I can not wait until I\'m done with this & quot; look in their faces. By the way, did I mention that there really is not much plot halfway through the movie? What makes this movie worse is that it really presents itself as a scary movie. Give me a break ! Roger Corman knew he was doing schlock and Ed Wood really thought he was making good movies. The creators of this film can not advocate for any case. In general, do not waste your time with this movie, rent another mummy movie.'",0
"b'I see many documentaries about health, fitness, etc. What I really liked about this particular movie is that it is very effective without resorting to the value of shock. The examples are extremely motivating. What started as an early extreme juice quickly became very feasible in just one and a half hours. My next purchase will be a juicer!'",1
"b'This DVD was very useful for those who lost a loved one in our faith family. He was able to demonstrate that we are not alone in our loss or pain and that while our loved ones have left here, they are still with us in spirit. Our faith strengthened us and united our family in the love of God. Louie Giglio is a Christian whose spirit sends a loving message from his heart.'",1
"b'This movie has all the characteristics of a classic. Great science fiction with a story that is convincing and attractive.

In general, a great narrative!'",1
"b'I agree with everyone that the studies are cheating us once again. TV movies SHOULD be available to all fans who have already purchased individual seasons. I think fans would even accept television movies as a ""disk only"" offer (without packaging) at a reasonable price ... for those who contact the studio. As regards the sets of boxes from ` `the whole series \'\'; I think it\'s a good idea, but NOT an idea that really works at this time. My main complaint is the amount of discs and non-standard boxes (LARGE) that are used for most series. Sure, it looks good in the store and online, but it sure does not fit well on a shelf with the rest of your DVD collection. Try putting a couple of sets of ""full series"" boxes on a shelf and see how fast it starts to look ridiculous! I prefer to buy individual seasons, which fit very well on a shelf (with the rest of my collection) and usually have better packaging. Remember that some of the ""all season"" box sets have the discs on top of each other (loose) or simply slide into small notches in cardboard (which scratches the discs). The real answer for the whole season sets will be the greater capacity of the BLU-RAY format. Less discs, prettier box (standard size), etc. Until then, I plan to buy seasons individually. JM'",0
"b""I saw Megaforce last night and there is a definite sound problem. The film has not been accelerated, the frame rate looks good, but all the sounds, the music, the voices, etc. They sound like they've been thrown or something. I have had an old copy of VHS for many years and would catch it from time to time when it was broadcast by cable on the day. As soon as the opening narrative began, I could see that there was a problem. Hopefully the Henstooth video is investigating this and offers a disk exchange. Another that the guilty pleasure of this cheese-fest 80 never looked better. They did a great job on that, they just need to fix this audio problem.

"b""There are certain movies in Hollywood where self-awareness is so obvious that you can practically see what goes on in the head of the filmmakers. `` We will talk about terrorism, but we will put an Arab-looking man in charge, so that the guard dogs of 9-11 do not catch us. We will also combine the good team and the bad team with enough racial colors on each side to make it look like a two-page Benetton spread so we can congratulate ourselves on how progressive we are. But all those missed opportunities in stereotypes need a place to vent. I have it! The Asian girl can still play the dragon lady of Kung Fu And the prostitute bitch! '' (The only two functions available to Asian women during the last hundred years?). I was having a five star experience, with the understanding that it was PURE ACTION FLICK ENTERTAINMENT AT THE BEST. The reality must be left at home, as wounded men jump out of cars at speed over concrete sidewalks before limping for 24 hours more than punishment. The angles change at a discordant rate every 3-4 seconds, although Bruce Willis is one of the lucky few who actually becomes more handsome as he gets older. In fact, I entertained myself a lot, discovering that I could suspend my anticipation of what might happen next. Well ... until the racist / sexist garbage of the hero speaks after leaving the yellow danger. `'I can get another dead Asian prostitute here right away? '' (Unless `` hooker b ** tch '' is colloquial to an opponent who violates security by decrypting the computer.) Imagine him murdering an African-American technician and making a comment about smoking a car dealership. Nobody would tolerate it. I know I would not. All I'm saying is that if you're going to have to go through all those problems to create a nice rainbow in the cast, why raining in the parade without following a few small steps? So after that, I found it increasingly difficult to suspend my imagination, knowing implicitly that the film was going to follow a strict script that would drag to appease the expectations of old people who frequent Thailand, you know ... programmers computers. There would be no more surprises, since all the luxury CGI that they threw at me felt like something I had seen and heard before. The film is about how a previous generation, with sneakernet technology (McClane for the young computer team: `` We are going to do something (cross the city) that they invented in the 60s: jogging ''), can still resist in front of the new presumptuous generation that plays the keyboard. Therefore, you must entertain by showing the gray generation that your language and your physical communication brand are still valid. I was encouraging the older, more physical generation. But really Hollywood. It has been more than twenty years since the Year of the Dragon. A soft-spoken hero whose most exciting moment in a movie is when he becomes Stanley White of Mickey Rourke, who looks like a dinosaur. And we all know what happened to the dinosaurs.""",0

It is best to continue watching the movie. video if you own a copy or if you do not just buy the video. I really rate this DVD as zero, not one.

"b'I found this tape very easy. I did not raise my heart to my target heart rate at all; I even start sweating. I tried again, raising the hip lifter up to 8 inches, which is not a challenge for training. Still pefer the old signature tapes to the newest ones. They are more effective than meeting.

"b""I must say that I am very satisfied with the restart of the series. I am a bit saying that it is on the cutting board for the cancellation. The voice work is excellent, as is the style of art. When I grew up with the original show that I swear was played by 3 people, it's great that they have a full team of voice artists doing the characters (if you've heard the original screechy voices, you'll understand). The work of art is clean first class animations and easy to follow during the action scenes. Good story also very deep considering the audience for which it was intended. In general a great purchase in my opinion.""",1
"b'I am very disappointed with this movie. Especially since it seems that they are two different themes at the same time. On the one hand, the film interviews some experts in the field of philosophy and theology, who trace the history and progression of postmodern thought quite effectively. On the other hand, there are the two filmmakers who simply discuss their useless and sometimes irrelevant ideas for discussion. The Williamson brothers ask questions that have little to do with postmodernism and more to do with their own personal dissatisfaction with the church. It is as if they had made this film to launch their own ideas and publicize it as a film about postmodernity. While some of the interviews with experts are useful to clarify trends in postmodern thinking, this video as a whole is not useful as a whole.'",0
"b'The bride with white hair 2 quickly followed the success of the original film, resuming the tragic story of Cho Yi-Hang (Leslie Cheung) and his forbidden love Lien Ni-Chang (Brigitte Lin). By betraying his sacred promise that he would never doubt his beloved, Cho has unleashed a monster. Ni-Chang\'s fury for Cho\'s betrayal makes her completely insane, transforming her into the white-haired witch who only lives to destroy all the living members of the Eight Clans, especially the Wu Tang clan to which Cho belongs. As for Cho, he has retired to Mount Shin Fung, guarding a mystical flower whose flowering (and which only blooms once every twenty years) can cleanse and restore the woman he still loves. Ten years have passed since the deadly night when Ni-Chang went mad and almost alone destroyed the Wu Tang clan. Only two members of the clan survive: Cho, who has been on duty at Mount Shin Fung under blizzard conditions all these years, and Kit, Cho\'s nephew (Sunny Chan). With the imminent marriage of Kit with Lyre (Joey Maan), there is an opportunity to expand the lineage, and so Ni-Chang stars the party, kidnaps the young bride and takes her to her private castle full of men -states, mortal women. There, Lyre is indoctrinated into the witch\'s philosophy ""See a man, kill a man"" and programmed to kill Kit with his own hands. The Eight Clans send their best warriors to try to kill the witch and rescue Lyre, but they are almost helpless against Ni-Chang, who uses his deadly hair as the most effective weapon (sounds weird, I know, but it works very well). It soon becomes clear that the only person who might be able to defeat the white witch is Cho Yi-Hang, and this sets the stage for a more unforgettable reunion between the two former lovers. This sequel is a more direct and action-oriented film. that the original The Bride With White Hair, and for that reason, I really found it more pleasant on the surface. Still, it lacks the depth and beauty of the original, largely because the two lovers do not meet face to face again until the final scene, although that meeting is worth the wait. Without a doubt, if you have seen and enjoyed the original, you will want to experience this sequel.'",1
"b'Yes, the movie itself is a great job, but the quality of the image of this Blu Ray version hardly shows any difference with the DVD.

"b""First of all, you can not see this DVD if you're a kind of politically correct stranger. Each stereotype, from the metal heads, the religious father and the teacher of gender studies, is reinforced and beaten mercilessly with brutal sarcasm. So, if this can offend you, DO NOT SEE IT! ! ! There, now, if you can take things easy, and you like extremely ruthless comedies, Dirtbags is the movie for you! You get a group of college metalhead burns, each of them trying to reach a specific goal in life (usually involving women's sexual favors), and getting involved in crazy situations that usually do not get away, just one more fall in absolute degeneration. I'm sure there's some kind of thesis on this for all of you, college students ... maybe you can never achieve your goals through dishonest means. Oh, I do not think so. It probably does not make sense, but it does not matter! And you must love the characters, who are all so colorful and strange that no fiction could create them completely. These are real images of life ... In fact, I've seen professors of male gender studies and Ogre-gym guys, so this is stranger than fiction. As I said, this movie is politically incorrect. No, I withdraw that; it is an antipolitical correction. It's great to see that someone has gone to the extreme and completely mocked political correctness, exposing it for the absurdity to which it has been taken. If there are no other redeeming qualities of this film in the eyes of the general public, at least it is the social critique that makes South Park look as docile as Sesame Street. Random, computer-generated, cheesy graphics (the skeleton during pizza, man's romp around the campus, the bee flying inside the soda can, the girl drowning over and over and over in the river) add a touch of film B and give testimony of the ingenuity of home movies. Personally, I think these things are great. The scenes of random nudity are, in my humble opinion, more by simple randomness than by gratifying drooling on the part of the viewer. Why is there a scene of a naked lady for several minutes? Because it is random and so completely stupid that it becomes quite fun. However, I must downplay a star for two reasons: one, the fact that this DVD does not have chapter selections (you can only watch the movie until the end). ), and two, the sound. With the sound, there is always music, and sometimes this dominates the dialogue (extremely annoying!), And due to the low budget, some of the dialogues are not recorded by experts, so it is low on the mix anyway. The first When I saw this, I really did not understand it, but when I saw it a second time, I was laughing hysterically. Include a cameo by Peter Steele from Type O Negative, a fantastic soundtrack that includes Immolation, Candlemass and a bunch of ridiculous songs, and you'll have real pleasure! ... That is, if you are not afraid of NOT taking this seriously.""",1
"b'This movie is excellent and deserves five stars, but this DVD release has the same problem as the first release, and since I bought both in this studio, I feel I have the right to complain.

"b'When I was a small child, I could not get this movie at all, but when I heard many positive reviews of this movie, some saying it was the best Disney movie, I decided to give it another try. So, I bought the DVD, and now, it\'s starting to grow on me! Now I totally agree that this is the best Disney movie I\'ve seen! No wonder this movie has won 5 Academy Awards! Songs like `` Chim Chim Cher-ee \'\' \'Spoonful of Sugar\' \'`` Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\'\' will always be trapped inside your head! This will always be the best character of Julie Andrews, no matter how many movies I make. She does a perfect job with Mary Poppins, and yet, she can really sing! No wonder it was so good on Broadway! I think Walt Disney made a perfect choice to hire Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins! Dick Van Dyke ROCKS! He is really more fun than ever, playing like Bert, and yet he is also a great dancer! I really laughed when he laughs in different stages during the scene with Uncle Albert. Another perfect selection made by Walt Disney! The special effects were PERFECT! I found out that Cherry Tree Lane was on the inside stage, but at first I thought it was happening in London! Without a doubt it is the best set I have ever seen. Also, I was really surprised when they wanted this to look like a Broadway stage! I really thought that they did it when they were doing the song, ""Step in Time"", that it had a really perfect energy, and there were no accidents, which really surprised me! I was also impressed that when the Nannies were dragged by a strong wind, and Mary Poppins flying to and from the Banks\' house, or all the images of Uncle Albert, or all the scenes in which they fly, you CAN NOT see a single cable ! The fireworks sounds were perfect in the mixed edition 5.1! I can go on and on, but I no longer have ideas! Behind the Scenes and Trailers was a perfect aid for the edition of Disc 2. It also has a new short called, ""The cat that looked at the king"". ""While I had an acceptable title, this short was very good. It would be a shame if he does not win an Oscar. I give this movie a solid +10 / 10. I give this DVD a solid 10/10 for having a perfect video and audio presentations. The video was so lovely that I could not see a scratch! The audio was incredible, but I would keep the 5.1 mix! Get this DVD not only for children, but also for adults!

"b""this DVD collection is amazing despite what the Amazon guy says (who reviewed it). I thought that the characters evolved perfectly. there is no need to prolong the obvious. They tell you what they are doing and why they are doing it. Is not that enough? Or do you like strenuous plots like Akira? Although there are some funny phrases in the story, there is nothing silly about it. the crazed turns that are given to vampires (such as implanted vampires and vampires with crosses) give this set a unique feeling throughout the process. The only thing that I thought was a bit strange was the issue of opening and closing credits. It does not fit (in my opinion) with the story. That really does not matter anyway, since it only lasts about 30 seconds. Another thing that I loved about this anime is that the dubbs in English are excellent. I'm not one of those anime nerds who likes to watch subtitles instead of the real movie and this will not disappoint those of you who feel the same. I give this series 5 to extreme violence, gore, adult situations and great animation / dubbing. Enjoy!""",1

"b""I was really disappointed with Sneiders Perfect Rebounding Workout. I bought it because I wanted an alternative to the DVD Collection of urban bounces. The first sign of trouble was at the beginning the interview on the tape, which showed the presenter, presumably Dr. Sneider, with a giant belly. That is not the role model I was looking for. To be honest, if you do the exercise in this video, you will get a good general training. But the video is very repetitive, completely devoid of enthusiasm, frankly boring and unprofessionally produced. For the rebound part, it makes very few movements, not very imaginative, over and over again. When changing from one movement to another, the camera almost never focuses on the teacher's feet to see what he is doing, so it can only be guessed. The `` class '' is composed of a group of people rhythmically challenged and totally out of shape in the front garden of the Royal Hawaiian hotel. They do not exercise in unison at all, and the camera is usually in them, not in the teacher. You must have hand weights to do the program. For the abs part of the program, for a large part the cameraman forgot to focus the camera. The two people are just blurs. Also, it just does not make sense to do your abs or yoga or pilates movements on a rebounder. It is absolutely uncomfortable to do so, and you can get a much better workout if you do it on a mat, without getting hurt under the hard rebounder. While the exercises in the abdominal and yoga parts were good, I recommend getting a different DVD without rebound, such as Candlelight Yoga (very excellent) with Sara Ivanhoe. That has many of the same movements as the yoga part of this training, but safe, well taught, photographed professionally and, above all, ENTHUSIASM. This was just a very boring and repetitive video. The Urban Rebounding compilations are not perfect, but they are MUCH better.""",0
"b""An amazing movie made under almost impossible circumstances. Located in Paris in the 1840s along a low-class theaters district (the `Boulevard of Crime '), the main story is about a mime (played by Jean-Louis Barrault) that falls in love with` `a woman of experience '' - brilliantly played by Arletty. In an incredibly touching and delicate scene, Arletty begs Barrault to make love to him, but he does not take advantage of the moment and abandons her. Find lust in the arms of others. Other important characters include a degenerate philosopher / writer; an actor of Shakespeare; a rich count who `` keeps '' Arletty; and the woman who loves Barrault and finally marries him. But the love between Barrault and Arletty remains true through the years, although in the end, after spending a glorious night together, she leaves him forever. The performance is excellent in everything, although what makes the film a masterpiece is the writing of Jacques Prevert: the dialogue is simply brilliant. The film was filmed during the Nazi occupation and many of the actors left the set to leave and fight in the resistance. The sets were constantly moving to avoid bombing and Nazi interference, when possible. The movie has a duration of c.190 minutes; the Nazis had a law that said that no film could exceed 90 minutes, so it was done as TWO independent films. The film is not only a testament of love in all its passionate intensity (it's a French film, after all), but also of the survival of a country and a big city, Paris, a whole civilization, in fact, that suffers under the plank of a fierce oppressor: it is the light of love, culture and memory that always shine from the darkness of hell. An amazing achievement in all the phases of the process of making the film, from the message of the story to the sets, acting and photography: it is a film of all times.""",1

"b""Well, yesterday I saw this at Costco and I picked it up, since it's one of my favorite movies from my childhood. My younger brother and I used to rent this on VHS from our local rental location every year around the first of our summer vacations. The film itself is ideal for a movie made for TV, it is as good or better than the animation of the series. The show itself is five stars, so why do I only give it two stars? . . The quality stinks. If you put it on a computer and verify the size, it's only 3.7 GB, not even a full 8 GB DVD, so they chose a cheap disk and used a single DVD in layers. You can see this when you play it because it's an interlace DVD, Google's interlaced DVD for more information. Basically this is to play on OLD TVs, not on the current HDTVs. It also seems that they used an old VHS for the tear instead of using original sources or even a LaserDisc, those huge record size DVDs, had a much higher quality than VHS and did not degrade over time as VHS does. If they started one of those would look much better. They also did not take long to create menus, when you go to watch trailers and change language is a very boring light blue menu without sound. I could have done a better job with the free software in the menus. In addition, the records were made in Mexico, they could not even splurge enough to make them in the United States. I'm glad it's on DVD now, but I've been waiting for so long that it bothers me that it's of poor quality. I can improve the quality a bit by tearing it off and using a combination filter to get rid of the interlacing, but why the hell could not they have launched a higher quality product? I also know some people with LaserDisc players, I could buy the LaserDisc and have it ripped, burn it to a DVD and put it in this case. The casing is beautiful and it looks good with my other DVDs and Blurays.""",0

"b'I obtained this video with the understanding that it will provide me with the basic concepts of yoga, and that I will progressively improve in yoga and I will feel more comfortable practicing it. The video provides a series of on-screen explanations of basic yoga postures with a small graphic. It is very difficult to read on the screen, the colot is too light and helps very little. The video is very good for those who have practiced yoga for a while and understand it well. I tried all the programs contained in the video, without success being able to follow the movements, and very little knowledge of how to do it.

With the help of his ex-girlfriend, archaeologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid), and his bitter rival, government agent Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff), Edward is about to learn that just because you do not believe in something he does not do. It means he can not kill you! `` According to Carnby\'s character, the The fear of the dark is what keeps us alive, but sadly, the fear of fucking movies does not prevent us from renting them in. Despite the horrible criticism, I decided to give in to the temptation to rent Alone In The Dark (I had a rental er free, so I thought there could not be much loss). It was even worse than I expected ... On the one hand, the creatures that are released from the depths of darkness, or any clich\xc3\xa9 of horse feces that are covered in history, are pathetic CGI dinosaur creatures. Something interesting, scary or even just ""great"" about them? Nop. Only computer-generated nonsense monsters that fail to entertain the public in the slightest way. For two, the performance is horrendous. Seeing Tara Reid in the main credits of the DVD made me move my eyes, but seeing her attempt to act as an archeologist in a science fiction action movie made me laugh. Christian Slater\'s only performance, but still not enough to cover the rest. And for all three, the movie is terribly boring, with few action scenes. Oh, sure, some unknown lumps here and there, some creatures blinking on the screen, and a little blood is included. But the real action? Very little . The small amounts of action that yes included is the reason why I gave two stars to this smelly. I do not like to see a movie suffer, but it deserves it. In conclusion, do not make the same mistakes as most critics when renting the movie, knowing how terrible it must be. Just trust the ratings of this. It will save your money and your time.'",0
"b'In 1879, a British column was almost annihilated by a large ""impi"" of Zulu warriors near Isandhlwana. Later, a small British force camped at the nearby Rorke\'s Drift (a commercial station and a mission) which consisted of 104 fit soldiers and a number of invalids in a makeshift hospital that became the next target. For two days, the station was attacked by waves of Zulu warriors. The total number of attackers was approximately 4,500. In the end, nearly 400 Zulus were killed compared to only 20 of the defenders, the hospital was burned and 11 crossed victories were handed over to the survivors. The film itself is a reasonably faithful recreation of the events. in Rorke\'s Drift, with a good performance by Michael Caine, Stanley Baker and a great cast of Zulus. The ferocity of the assault, the stubborn and desperate defense of the small garrison and the chaos of hand-to-hand combat on the barricades can be felt through filmmaking. A wonderful aspect of this film is that the battle scenes were filmed using a large number of actors in the role of Zulu warriors, who obviously were able to recreate the tactics and movement of the true army of 1879. Their war cries, movements synchronized spear on shield and advance in formation create the sensation of a royal army moving to attack the apparently condemned garrison. This is one of the few films that gives the viewer an idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bwhat the combat should have been like in the days before the appearance of the mechanized armies on the scene.'",1

This will never be called a masterpiece of cinematography, acting or special effects. On the other hand, it is not meant to do so. The film achieves what it proposes. The charm of the film is to execute quite silly situations. From Vikings flying from the ends of the Earth to Erik fighting against a host of enemies thinking that he is invisible. The special effect hardly rivals that of other Python films made in the 70s, and this was done in 1989. The performances of the cast of Monty Python are not the best, however, they are entertaining and satisfying. The thing is that none of that is really important. Erik the Viking is a good and entertaining story with some thoughtful but subtle observations about the human condition and religion. Even dark things end up not being so depressing in the end. This DVD is really hard to find, and to make matters worse, Sony created a Director's Cut, but until now had never bothered to release it in the United States. If you have a free region DVD, there is a director's son cut available in the UK, so there is hope. If you find the rare launch without features of the USA. UU For a reasonable price, I recommend that you get it without a doubt, since Sony has not made any announcement to make any new issue. If you're a Monty Python fan, then, of course, look at Erik the Viking. Those of you who do not have Python-style humor will not appreciate this either. If you like the kind of humor mixed with some decent Nordic mythical stories (and do not criticize the low budgets of production), this movie should be a good distraction from reality.""",1
"b""this DVD is a treasure, especially if, like me, you've seen the band live and you can not get enough of them. It is very fun to see these live performances and also meet the band, and catch them in their tired states, drunks, rockers and joking. the dvd also deals with the problem of am! Universal was asked to sign a recording contract with them, but I am! he has remained faithful to Fat Wreck and will not be part of the corporate machine. Much respect to them for that decision. (if you go to a show of yours, say hello to the band, they are so kind and you can probably talk to them there =) the energy of this band is captured on this DVD and I thank you very much for making this DVD and all its many albums. I'm not sure exactly what else I should write for this review! against me ! It's one of the most rockin 'bands and I'm very grateful that you put your political opinions there shamelessly! touch the exact subject! Few bands have such good politics and music energetic, passionate, thoughtful, sound and rockin. thanks, I am! The only drawback of this DVD is that it makes you miss them. Support the independent music that exists, that's part of the revolution!""",1
"b""When a nuclear submarine unexpectedly falls into the Pacific Ocean and a hurricane prevents the military from sending a team later, they subcontract an offshore drilling rig near the area led by Bud Brigman (Ed Harris). To help the drilling team, the military sends a group of Navy SEALs led by Lieutenant Coffey (Michael Biehn) accompanied by the designer of the underwater oil rig and Bud again with his wife Lindsey Brigman (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio). But while searching the nuclear submarine, they realize that there could be more to the sinking of the submarine than they thought, and while Lieutenant Coffey believes the Russians are responsible, the drilling team believes there could be something else .. supernatural involved. There are few directors who really know how to head each effort the way James Cameron does. His first film, The Terminator set a precedent for action films in the 80s, and he only surpassed that achievement with Terminator 2. With Aliens he made a film that was at least equal to Ridley Scott's Alien by making a sequel that changed the mood and style while respecting the original. In 1989, James Cameron directed The Abyss, a film that took place mainly under water, and that was filmed in the largest submarine set of the time. The assembly, built in a half-finished nuclear reactor facility, included 7 million gallons of water. So, among Cameron's other achievements, how does The Abyss rise? The Abyss is definitely Cameron's most underestimated movie. When watching movies like Avatar, Aliens, The Terminator and Terminator 2 it's easy to see how you can forget a movie like The Abyss, but if you look closer, The Abyss fits in with the others. Like other Cameron movies, it shows great attention to detail, with incredible special effects. On a technical scale, the film feels like real life, something that is always great when it comes to a Cameron movie. But, like other Cameron films, it's not about the special effects but the human element. Cameron does a great job humanizing his characters and giving body to their relationships. The performance is phenomenal, of course I would not expect less from a movie that includes Michael Biehn (The Terminator, Aliens) and Ed Harris (The Truman Show, The Rock). Biehn does it very well as a soldier who has lost communication with the outside world and has to make calls on his own about his next move, and that is driving him crazy. Ed Harris is great as the tough platform leader who longs for his ex-wife who keeps running away in different jobs without him, and Marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio is great as the aforementioned wife who finds that being stuck with Bud and his team is repulsive, but that grows close to the husband she had left behind and the team he runs. If you have not seen this movie, but you like the other Cameron movies, I recommend you give it this opportunity. I would say that this movie is possibly even better than The Terminator, and since I think Aliens is better than The Terminator, I think this is on par with Aliens. Give it a try, this is definitely a dormant classic that deserves more exposure than it gets.""",1
"b'(5/3/12, 1 star for this Blu-ray release, 5 stars for the movie) I have the normal DVD with English subtitles, which StudioCanal has inexplicably omitted from its Blu-ray version. Why would they do this? To make a few dollars more profit? Apart from insensitivity, it is undoubtedly an erroneous financial calculation on your part. There are countless moviegoers with less than perfect hearing that probably transmit this release. My wife is a non-native English speaker who needs English subtitles to capture all the dialogues, especially when the actors have a British accent. She will not watch the Blu-ray version, and as we always watch movies together, I will not either. I imagine that there are millions of viewers all over the world who feel the same.'",0
"b""It was the franchise fight that fans thought would never happen, except in the form of comics. After years and years of failed attempts and false starts, the powers finally succeeded. Hoping to capitalize on the amazing success of the merger of two successful horror franchises with Freddy vs. Jaso, two of the most popular science fiction creatures face each other face to face in Alien vs. Predator with those annoying humans trapped in the middle. There is not a clich\xc3\xa9 and eacute; that this movie does not like Disposable characters are widely sketched. For example, a bottle cap worn around the neck of a character is considered a defining feature. The film even manages to include that old chestnut tree where the characters overcome a fireball explosion. Fans who expect the two alien races to start hitting would have to wait almost an hour until their first battle, but it's pretty impressive as they throw each other out like something out of a comic book. It is true that the fight scenes are great in all their glory assisted by CGI, but this is not an endorsement. Poor Lance Henriksen is swaggering him here as a selfish entrepreneur who provides the only human link to the other Alien films (insinuating that he is the inspiration for the Android bishop in Aliens). It's only in about a quarter of the movie before it's dispatched quickly. There is an audio commentary by writer / director Paul W.S. Anderson and actors Lance Henriksen and Sanaa Lathan. They connect apparently as oblivious to the narrative disorder that is this movie. Also included is an audio commentary from visual effects supervisor John Bruno and creature effects designers Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr. Anyone who wants to hear these details will find this clue. There are three deleted scenes that total a total of two minutes and include a bit of Predator humor that was cut correctly. Also included are two advances and a gallery of the covers of the comics. to Dark Horse 's Alien vs. Predator series. Alien vs. Predator was not worth the wait and the fans of the comic will feel cheated. The movie begins slowly, but once the aliens and predators begin to hit each other, the weak script and the clumsy plot mercifully fade into the background. It's a shame because both alien races are ready for innumerable story ideas that subsequent sequels have not been able to capitalize effectively. All we have left is a good paint film by numbers.""",0
"b'This DVD was nothing like the novel, the characters were combined and the story was told out of sequence. It was purchased as a teaching tool to accompany the novel in a special needs class, I could not use it for this purpose.'",0
"b""I do not know where these other criticisms came from (they are identical to drunken wu tang). This movie is NOT drunk Wu Tang. I bought it with the impression that it was. Even IMDB says it is the same. It's not that you do not fool yourself. He does not even have the same actors! ! ! ! ! ! ! The IMDB website is wrong! The information page on Amazon is also wrong!""",0
"b'Very weak . Half of this video is recorded in a fish tank. The quality is marginal and even fish seem to know how poor it will be. This is a completely amateur production. I do not know about the inspiring messages, I turned that function off after the first, which was not so inspiring.'",0
"b""I was terribly excited to discover that one of my favorite classic movies, the 1963 Peter Brooks & quot; Lord of the flies & quot; It was on DVD. I was even more excited when I saw that a study called Criterion had given him a luxury treatment. & quot; Lord of the flies & quot; It was the first DVD I bought and I was introduced to the phenomenal Criterion Collection. Every extra on this DVD is fantastic and interesting, there is no stuffing or no sense praise. The comment alone is worth the price of this DVD, it gives a great idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bhow this movie was made: for example, the film was one of the first independent productions produced. This is one of those rare comments that increase your appreciation and understanding of the film, I classify it next to & quot; Seven samurai & quot; and & quot; Grand Illusion & quot; (also both Criterion dvds) comments as one of the best I've heard. The film seems absolutely fantastic, worlds better than any vhs or laser disk edition I've seen before; Criterion produced an amazing and clean image that will impress in any video configuration. _Lord of the Flies_ is one of my favorite novels; Golding masterfully touched on many themes and concepts about society and managed to capture the essence of humanity in the juvenile cartoons he created. For the most part, those themes and ideas are very faithful in the film. As noted in the dvd commentary; there is no script credit, because there was no script, the production team worked directly from the novel, using it as their only source of history. The result is a remarkably clear and coherent adaptation of the original novel, brought to life with great faith and surprising dexterity for a novice filmmaker. You can still see some technical limitations in the final product, but they do not contribute to your enjoyment of the film. In short: a fantastic, dark and irresistible story is charged to life in such a stark manner that the viewer sometimes seems like a documentary that develops. Finally, to top it off, the film received a real treatment on DVD that perfectly complements and improves the film itself; In total, it is worth the price of admission.""",1
"b'Ghost World is an initiation story that defines the character of a generation that is one of the most elusive in modern memory. Enid (Thora Birch) is trapped in a small town with her companions and adults who are not going anywhere. Only Norman, the future passenger of the bus, is reliable from his point of view, perhaps because at least he is trying to leave the city, although this is not something that happens to the audience but something to think about. This is a reflective movie with attractive characters, sharp wit and soft warmth. The composition that includes the use of color in the ensemble and the costumes is exuberant and clear; the editing and the highly expressive camera. I recommend this film to anyone who likes to better understand the lives and problems of middle-class youth struggling with the search for identity at the end of the 20th century.'",1

"b'As a former Marines and Vietnam veteran, I have to disagree with Mr. Brennan\'s interpretation of the second half of this film. The scenes of war were marginal at best and failed to capture the ""realism"" of the war ... Platoon was much better in that regard. Mainly because Oliver Stone was a veteran, himself. However, the scenes of the training camp at FMJ were accurate. R.Lee Ermey played the Drill Instructor perfectly, as it should have been, after having been the same in real life. I had several D.I. It\'s like that in the training camp and I can assure you that it was during the Vietnam War. Now I can laugh at the movie, but while we were in training camp it was not a matter of laughing, we were there to learn to fight and go to war, other skills were learned, but they were secondary. We had to be tough and they made sure we were there. The training camp portion was almost like a documentary for me! Having said all that, the movie was like two parts to me. The first half and the second half. With one person dead and the other alone and totally based on Hollywood\'s perception of what the war was like. For those who were not there, believe me ... It was very different from this version. In general, due to the performance of R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D\'Onofrio I give him 4 stars.'",1
