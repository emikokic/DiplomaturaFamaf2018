"b""If ever a movie required English subtitles, that's it. Accents and soft conversation are excellent but difficult to follow because you can not understand what they say and without subtitles. Her songs were just beautiful and the story is great, but much of it is lost not to catch what they say. But it was a refreshing film of most people there. Beautiful game and story.""",1
"b'""Just Married"" is a painfully cheesy film that is almost too light and cute. Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy play a couple of Romeo and Juliet - esqe that has been rehearsed in so many movies, it\'s disgusting - he\'s the classic dorky sports fan and the kid of middle-income parents. whose job never teaches us. Her parents would have rather married the snob Peter Prentice, a dull antagonist who is more a roadblock than a real character. Anyway, the pretty couple gets married and flies to Europe where their lies and their incredible circumstances (they are expelled from a hotel after spoiling the circuit while trying to plug some kind of sex toy) perfect honeymoon. The film was made worse by bad jokes, boring characters and clich\xc3\xa9 & egrave; scenarios. I think I considered laughing once. The terrible thing about this movie was how amazing everything was. Each character was able to draw a magnificent and comforting monologue. Most of the speeches did not even match the personality of the character, for example, Kutcher\'s character gave at least two of these monologues, and each was one of the best parts of the film\'s script. Too bad they came out sounding inevitably and awkwardly, since the character is not supposed to be the brightest bulb in the box. Finally, the characters were painfully underdeveloped. We do not know if Murphy\'s character likes to be rich or not, and we can never really discern whether she\'s a rich girl or an art lover. We never find out what Murphy\'s father does, and although a good father-son relationship is evoked between Kutcher\'s character and his father, we never know. Finally, a pretty blonde was constantly around the character of Murphy ... was she a sister? friend? cousin? It pestered me throughout the movie. So, why not 1 star instead of 2? Well, Murphy and Kutcher have been great actors with amazing chemistry. Murphy has especially illuminated the screen with his dazzling personality and his cute and squeaky voice. Kutcher will always be considered an idiot, but he is a character that fits him well. I found them to be the only highlights of the film. It was fast and slightly pleasant, but something was missing or something different. See if you like girls, not if your idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8ba movie is the one that will make you think.'",0
"b'I may not be able to add much to the critics, which I fully share the praise of the content of this beautiful film, but I still felt compelled to offer my two cents on BluRay, this which is just as fantastic. With the full measure of the glory of the backdrop of this story now rightly restored in HiDef, the drama inherent in the script now, finally, finally, a canvas just as worthy of being presented - a fact that has been perpetually lost on all the other video presentations I\'ve seen before. In fact, it is an impressive revaluation of the anticipated impact of this film and, from all previous editions of this video, a transformation of a first-rate adventure of acceptable magnitude to an adventure of the first order. a remarkable show! I dare say it did not sound so good when I remember seeing it in my local theater years ago. Besides, it looks so good, I do not think anyone can dream, as soon as it appears here, that this film marks its 50th anniversary. From the opening credits, I find that the film was shot at 70 mm, so with much more detail than the most common 35 mm films. You can expect similar performance in HiDef with other 65 or 70mm movies, like 2001: A Space Odessy or Lawrence of Arabia - IF disk transfer is good - and it\'s certainly the case here. The image as part of this disc is still and completely as stable as the Rock of Gibralter. There was only the slightest amount of flicker, as seen in my setup, but, again, rarely and barely noticeable when she was seen - still not sure whether the record was really to blame or no. Not a hint of moir\xc3\xa9, nowhere. The sound is rather good and much better than I could have hoped. Although John Barry \'s beautiful score was apparently originally in mono, it is by far the best I\'ve heard of - it even has a better feel than the soundtrack (mono) available on CD, if I remember is good. However, the sound effects track on this disc is either a true stereo or, more likely, derived from various isolated sound effect elements, and then ""panned"" during post-production. There are even good extras: more than two documentaries on the making of the film, a commentary on the film, the trailer and even a brief but interesting interview with John Barry himself about the origin of his ideas for the film. partition. But overall, I love it so much when a film as majestic and monumental as this one receives the royal treatment it does here. Sometimes the presentation is everything! Highly, highly recommended! !'",1
"b'I have been a 3D nut for several decades. I pre-ordered amazon and man, what a disappointment! The quality of the video is only slightly better than that of the 3D slide shutter bootleg DVD from the 90\'s (and at least the 3D DVD was FULL SCREEN), made from a 3D 3D VHD disc. Even the 3D ""red / blue"" trailer for this movie (from 3D Film Expo at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood) was full screen. If you Google on this title, you will find some websites with photo comparisons (PAL, NTSC, DVD, Blu-ray, etc ...) and you can clearly see that this Blu-ray 3D collects the movie of ALL SIDES. Only a small number is cropped from left to right, but it lacks a bit of the top and bottom to create this ratio of 1.85 from the full screen. Part of the 3D perception is lost because of that, and that\'s probably what the others mean here by some scenes that look like ""flat"" or ""2D"". One of the most striking scenes is when Margot & Mark are chatting on the premises. This beautiful shot is obviously configured for the 3D effect. Margot\'s hand is resting on the end table in the foreground, showing this beautiful diamond ring. Guess what ? In this 3D Blu-ray version, his ENTIER hand is completely cut off! I continued to notice these cropped scenes throughout the film ... discarded characters, cut - out lampshades, and so on. Yes, it\'s great to see this red dress look really red, but unfortunately the colors are seriously oversaturated. I think I would not stick to the House of Wax or the FTBL Creature before other reviews of LOL guinea pigs arrive! I\'m sure others will agree that the black ink printed on the Blu-ray disc itself looks awful. I saw better labels on DVD bootleg! Anyway, just my 2 cents.'",0

"b'If you look at the fine print on this DVD, you will see that it is not approved by the Wayne Foundation. And the picture quality of this DVD has all the features of being a DVD recording of a VHS copy of the movie. They did not even bother to use a new VHS tape - judging by the grainy texture and flaws (flicker, ""hair"" on the screen, etc.) annoying, they were captured from an old copy of the tape. I have a VHS tape that has a better picture than this DVD. Do not forget to write to the Wayne Foundation and tell them about the bad publication of this movie! If we make ourselves heard, we might be able to convince them to release the higher quality Criterion versions of John Wayne\'s lesser-known films. UPDATE: PLEASE NOTE!

"b'... but a terrible DVD. The sound is clearly old Dolby Surround and the movie is in full screen. I find that very boring. I have always loved Joshua Tree and I was looking forward to the release of the DVD. I imagined a widescreen, Dolby 5.1, movie trailers, commentaries and animated menus. But none of this has happened. Artisan disappointed me so much with this mediocre and unimaginative outing. I would like to launch a campaign for Artisan to change his mind. To get them to reissue this awesome movie on the big screen. They have to do it because this film is totally broken down. Even the current cover is terribly awful. A dark image of a Joshua Tree would be better. One last thing. Amazon and the back of the DVD indicate that the execution time is 102 minutes whereas it is actually the unrated version 106. This version must remain intact in the future widescreen version.'",0
"b'From time to time, I reviewed this film. It\'s funny. ""El Dorado"" has his hokey moments, with James Caan continually talking about ""riding boldly"" in a poem about El Dorado, Maudie (John Wayne\'s love) picking up where Wayne\'s many women\'s movies have taken place arrested: ""I will not cry. I\'m just going to buy a pine box, about 6 feet for you ""and then the required speech on how stupid men are to fight and the women are healthy for looking forward to seeing their men come home, blah , blah blah He has a geezer sidekick (Arthur Honeycutt) who imitates Walter Brennen from Rio Bravo, James Caan who imitates Ricky Nelson from Rio Bravo and Mitchum who imitates Dean Martin from Rio Bravo and finally, Charlene Holt, who imitates Angie Dickinson in Rio Bravo. \'\' See the model? ""Rio Bravo"" and ""El Dorado"" are essentially the same movie. A sheriff, his sidekick and John Wayne, his sidekick and his girlfriend. Formulaic. However, there is a good movie here. There are elements of Wild Woolly Westerns here. Christopher George plays the nasty Gunslinger who nonetheless warms up at Cole Coleton\'s John Wayne and SPOILER ALERT! it ends well.But there is a scene that is golden: George and his gang of bad guys enter the bar to see the other villain / breeder Edward Asner.When they come in, DIY piano plays and they swagger in. It is straight out of a shoot of 1920. It is not a work of art. But it will entertain. John Wayne is the ultimate John Wayne with his John Waynisms. Mitchum is rather a spectator and reviews the movements. In all, entertaining and a poem to the formula of Cowboy movies.'",1
"b""If you want to be alone while watching Alone In The Dark, there is good news and bad news. The good news is that you will get your wish. The bad news is that misery loves the company. To be hanged by red nipple clamps on a cactus and scorpion fossa would be less painful than sitting through that household trash on Reid aliens as a museum curator. Pinch me, I must be dreaming.Make a pinch a slap in the face, and that's what this movie hokey movie offers you. Alone in the Dark is supposed to be based on an old Atari game, which I have never heard of. What I remember from the old Atari games is their graphics and their rudimentary intrigues. I doubt that the long story of the film was taken into consideration. To fill the gaps, writers Elan Mastai, Michael Roesch and Peter Scheerer borrowed and stole other films. Better movies Films that make you realize that you're not just looking at an imitation, but a very bad imitation, like Chuck Norris paying tribute to Judy Garland. I admit that his interpretation of Easter Parade made me cry, but only because he was kicking me in the face. That's what it was like to watch Alone in the Dark. I do not like stupid and stupid horror movies, but I hate stupid and stupid horror movies that refuse to acknowledge this fact. Alone in the Dark comes with such a poker face that it's impossible to know if we're supposed to take it all seriously. We are, but we are not, or more precisely, can = t. There is no room for maneuver in the scenario, direction or game. Government conspiracies abound (after a long operating session) in Alone in the Dark, where paranormal investigator Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) defeat an old evil. As an orphan, Edward escaped the clutches of unscrupulous agent / scientist Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker), whose depraved experiences turned children into cross-zombies. Now that Hudgens has found the final key to opening the portal between darkness and light, it's Edward, former lover and curator Aline Cedrac (Reid) and Burke (Stephen Dorff) commando chief of saving humanity. which I would call when the ultimate evil would decide to dirty humanity: two actors straddling this rail of direct video and an actress known for her flashing paparazzi. Was it a casting or refund decision? Director Uwe Boll (The House of the Dead) does not help much, never allowing actors to get out of the paper box or express an emotion beyond the written word. If everyone in front of or behind the camera had just recognized the obvious, Alone in the Dark would have been a hoot. Computer-generated monsters that never seem to occupy the same frame as the actors, joyful commandos, a complicated plot that makes no sense, paper doll characters, all the pitfalls of a good time. Dark did not fall into this trap.""",0
"b""We continued to yawn while watching this Sony stinker. It's probably the worst digital animation movie we've ever seen, and we've seen all the details.

Children MAY enjoy it (we do not have one, so we can not comment). Please do not waste your money on this movie unless you're sure your little ones would like it.""",0
"b'Always disappointing I was really hopeful, but between the tough lines and the bad game, it was hard to bear. I think the wolves chasing the vampire were the highlight of the movie. There was no emotional connection, I think it was worse than twilight if it was possible. It amazes me completely that with such a large budget and fan base, they can not even cope. The cheese outfits, makeup and even the soundtrack were bad. Go read the books, there is no comparison.'",0

"b""I do not know who I'm sorry for, Stephen Dorff or Christian Slater. Dorff, who is an excellent actor, even if you'll never know from the movies he's been in, has not had a very good year since the first Blade in 1998. Slater's career has deteriorated over the years. years, including participating in flop projects. Both actors spend their time through their roles in this latest video game to adapt the director Uwe Boll, the same guy who brought us another video game adaptation, the very nasty House of the Dead. Alone in the Dark is not much better, with a story so non-existent that you will cringe your head wondering what's going on before praying for everyone to be killed. Tara Reid is also on board as a smart girl and, as previous commentators have mentioned, we know she is smart because she wears glasses. There is not a redemptive factor about Alone in the Dark, and if you surrender to the House of the Dead parody, then you know what to expect here.""",0
"b""This DVD attempts to cover in one hour the complete history of North American exploration. Given its purpose, I think it's a pretty decent job to do it. He summarized five hundred years of history and dozens of expeditions and explorers in brief information. I do not think this is a good teaching tool, because it would probably be somewhat uninteresting - it does not have very interesting stories, just a flow of information. Rather, it is a good starting point for those wishing to research North American exploration and would like an introduction to key events and people in its history. Not really something that excites people about history, people who see this should already be excited.""",1

So, with that, I was excited to see this movie and relive some memories. What a desappointment. It was not scary at all. The people at the theater were actually *** SLEEPING ***.

An ancient civilization opened the door between these two worlds before and was destroyed. Now the key has been broken (why not destroyed? They never destroy those things!) And sent to the four corners of the earth. Now, take everything that has been neat, exciting, fun and interesting in an Indiana Jones-style movie and throw it into the canvas a few times.

"b'Before looking at this, do not make the mistake of putting this film on stage with ridiculous comedies like ""Tootsie"" and ""Mrs. Doubt Although based on a true story, director Greenwald avoids several Western (and Hollywood) conventions to bring one of the best Westerns of the 1990s. Suzy Friends plays Jo, a woman who has a little confidence in some nasty men. After escaping to the west and leaving her son, she is almost raped by two soldiers. To hide, she wears men\'s clothes and scars on her face, possibly using her new facade to get what she needs in the west to survive. Ian McKellen embodies a woman who takes him, believing she is a young man. She ends up befriending Bo Hopkins, who has her best role in years, and starts a sheep ranch. She falls in love with a Chinese woman she has been forced to hire as a cook and eventually has to fight with a group of cattle to try to gain a foothold and hunt sheep farmers. Friends looks like Eric Stoltz in his man scenes. is totally believable. McKellan and Rene Auberjonois have modest but essential roles as an older father, who trusts Friends, but eventually turns on her. Bo Hopkins is great because the neighbor Friends tolerates, befriends and tolerates. David Chung incarnates the Chinese nicknamed Tin Man as a deficient man dependent on opium. It looks perfect for the party, the scars of life and everything. Heather Graham also has a small part as a Friends partner, and does her best with her. The most surprising aspects of this film are what the film is not. There are no cute scenes from ""Yentl"" where Friends falls in love with a man as a man. The war of cattle herders, a classic plot of the West, never goes beyond history or ends in a banal conclusion. The final scenes, with Jo\'s unmasking, look almost like joke, but when you think about it later, play very sincerely and touchingly, especially the Hopkins reaction. His script is also very clever, never leaving for cheap laughs or the kind of exploitation that a male director might have had. I highly recommend `` La Ballade de Petit Jo. ""This is noted (R) for physical violence, gun violence, some sexual violence, violence, some profanity, some female nudity, sexual content, sexual references, substance abuse and adult situations.'",1
"b'I bought this DVD without having seen it in the theater or on video. I bought it based on the strong reviews I\'ve seen on the top ten end-of-year lists. This is one of the few (only?) Big animated works that is not a musical. He relies solely on the strength of his characters to tell the captivating story of the young ""Hogarth"" (yes, Hogarth!) Who befriends a giant robot that landed on the ground in the 1950s. Naturally, the military and other adults are wary of the seemingly benign giant. The real strength of this film is that adults and children will enjoy it because it works on many levels. It\'s a devious commentary on 50\'s paranoia (without being cumbersome), an exciting adventure film and a humorous comedy for adults and children. Both will fall in love with the ""Iron Giant"" (played by Vin Diesal of ""Saving Private Ryan"") who will finally teach us things about loyalty and sacrifice. A word of caution for those who have very small children: there are some ""damned"" and ""hell"" (3 or 4) throughout the film; thus its PG rating.'",1
"b""I agree with Shemp Newberg's criticism. I have other DVDs from Stefan Grossman, which I talked about with pleasure. I have this one to start learning the bottleneck.

I guess I'll look for another intro bottleneck. On a positive note, there are some great historical clips of bottleneck legends, if you like that stuff (which I do).""",0
"b'Certainly the best Carmen I\'ve seen, aside from the movie Domingo (I did not see van Otter\'s performance). The highlights are of course the performances of the soprano Domashenko and Dashuk; both get their roles right, even if the first is a bit discreet - but in a way, I do not think Carmen was a lady of nuances. Just notice their beauty - they are really beautiful to watch. A few nights ago, I watched a Turandot (another production of Zeffirelli) that was spoiled as a show because the princess was played by a woman the size of a hospitality tent (and she was not a great singer either). Curiously, in this production, it is men who make eyebrows. they are middle-aged, overweight and visually unconvincing, which diminishes credibility, since Zeffirelli focuses on the ""look"" of a production; It\'s hard to see how Jose and Escamillo could, in modern parlance, ""shoot"" women like that! OK, maybe the fame of the latter is a factor. As for singing, the sopranos excelled, Berti was doing well, Acelo a mediocre, and one or two of the singularly shady singers. The conductor and the orchestra were good. As another commentator has pointed out, it is not hard to believe that every family in Verona was represented on this massive stage, as well as a few tourists. There were more horses on stage than racing at the Grand National, and I think I saw my dog, who had been let out for a walk, in one of the scenes. No elephants though. And yes, the constant search of male singers for the conductor\'s signal was irritating, but with so many people on stage, it\'s pity that they did not have to jump up to get the rhythm . cavils. I really enjoyed the performance, more like a show than a big opera. I think my dog \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bdid the same because he came back very late.'",1

"b""It was the franchise that slugfest fans thought never happened except in comics. After years and years of unsuccessful attempts and false starts, the powers finally come together. In the hope of capitalizing on the surprising success of merging two horror franchises with Freddy and Jaso, two of the most popular science fiction creatures compete in Alien. Predator with those annoying humans caught in the middle. There is no clich\xc3\xa9; that this movie does not like. Disposable characters are widely drawn. For example, a bottle cap worn around a character's neck is considered a characteristic feature. The film even manages to include this old chestnut where the characters exceed the explosion of a fireball. Fans waiting for the two extraterrestrial races to start beating will have to wait nearly an hour before their first battle, but it's impressive. like something in a comic book. Certainly the fight scenes are pretty cool in all their CGI-assisted glory, but that's hardly an endorsement. Poor Lance Henriksen is here a selfish businessman who provides the only human link with other Alien films (implying is the inspiration for the bishop android in Aliens). It may be only a quarter of the film before being shipped quickly. There is an audio commentary by writer / director Paul W.S. Anderson and actors Lance Henriksen and Sanaa Lathan. They are connected to the game, seemingly unaware of the narrative mess that constitutes this film. An audio commentary by visual effects supervisor John Bruno and creator effects creators Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr is also included. Anyone who likes to listen to such details will find this track informative. at Dark Horse 's Alien vs. Predator.Alien Series vs. Predator was not worth the wait and fans of the comics would feel cheated. The film begins slowly, but once the Aliens and Predators begin to fight, the weak scenario and the clumsy plot disappear in the background. It's a shame because these two extraterrestrial races are ripe for countless story ideas that the following sequels have not been able to exploit effectively. All we have left is a beautiful painting film by numbers.""",0

It should be noted that the special effects and music of the Tubular Bells are always wonderful, not at all. Max von Sydow is also particularly memorable as Father Merrin. The plot involves the possession of a 12 year old girl by an old demon (is there another type). Murder, a dubious priest and a famous mom are thrown into the mix. It's as scary and realistic as you remember. On a special note, this DVD edition contains about a dozen minutes of cutting room footage - and that's a good thing.

""Battlefield"" drew holes bigger than Swiss cheese - and think it was a work of love (!!!) John Travolta saw this film in homage to L. Ron Hubbard. But this resulted in a catastrophic flop. And no wonder. ""Battlefield"" has humans living in primitive conditions, at the mercy of Dreadlocks Psychlos led by John Travolta and Forest Whitaker. Human civilization is in ruins.

"b""The third installment of the popular & quot; Beverly Hills Cop & quot; The series is like a distant relative who comes to stay with you. At first, you are happy to see them and get used to the past, but they are definitely exhausted. This film reaches this point after about fifteen minutes. Eddie Murphy is back with Alex Foley, Detroit detective, more and more unlikely. Once again, Axel fights with the police, the Beverly Hills Police Department and the Bad Guys who killed his friend. Sound familiar? Even Serge (Bronson Pinchot) is back, in a desperate and painful scene that seems to last forever. The direction, by veteran Murphy, John Landis, is acceptable, showing Landis' usual flair for stimulation and stunts. The scenario of Steven deSouza, generally reliable, is unfortunately half finished. You never know what the tone of the image is. The action scenes are very offbeat and often played for laughter, while the comedy scenes are forced and not very harmonious. History never creates the sense of danger and conflict essential to a film of this type. It's not a riot of laughter, not even at a distance. In addition, any film that makes Hector Elizondo, one of the best actors of the character, looks bad, poses serious problems. There are two good things about & quot; Cop III. & quot; One is an excellent action sequence on a big wheel of the amusement park. This is the only exciting part of the movie. The other thing I liked was the series of cameos by several famous directors (like George Lucas), a typical Landis gag. This gives you at least something to look for in quite boring scenes.""",0
"b'I agree 100% with the comments of another critic ... If you like this movie, do not buy this DVD. This version is terrible. I watched it once and wanted to take the record out, put it on my entrance and cross it several times with my car. Go back to the editing school, Bill Jones. Really insulting to anyone who is a fan of this movie. I would give him negative stars if I could.'",0
"b'The game in this movie stinks, ridiculously. Even Tara Reid can not save this movie. What, Reid is a scientist because she puts on glasses? She looks more like a gym trainer. Is Christian Slater more intelligent? The direction is almost as bad as some of Ed Wood\'s films. The film may have had a sci-fi plot, but the film has scarcely explored any part of its plot. The film is not only bad, it is sometimes boring, only stimulated by the fun of horribly done script lines and meaningless action. Above all, this film incriminates its director. I give this film two stars out of five. This film had at least some pictures. I did not hate his stupidity as much as this other movie also based on a video game, ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"", which I considered as the worst movie of his year.'",0
"b'These DVDs catapulted our sex life. My partner and I found the ""buttons"" of each and we have a good time. Since watching DVDs, one of the things I love to do is to surpass it, and I know very well when she is at the top and desperate to go. She seems to love everything I do during this time, and one of my favorite things is to keep her as long as possible in this intense desire and let her down before dropping her. These techniques answered questions that I had been asking myself for a long time about how to please him - but only to bring MORE questions that I had not even considered before. We have become very interested in what she wants, every time we have sex. My most recent question is: do women prefer to get up slowly, then give up a few more times, or would they rather stay on the edge for long periods? From my point of view, the more she gets and the longer she stays there, the more rewarding she is for me. When I ask her what she likes, it seems to be what I did at the time. I heard her stay at the seaside called ""sweet torture"" and I would love to have a feminine point of view. As I said, we are really sensitive to her sexual pleasure, and I attribute this renewed interest partly to the techniques given in the videos. I highly recommend it, but ONLY if what you want is a super busy sex life! ! !'",1
"b""Great Milestones is an exploration of breeding habits and mating rituals of different types of animals. The interesting aspects of this subject are the way the Moon and the tides regulate and synchronize certain elements of the reproduction and how the weather conditions also play a role. Not only are terrestrial animals studied, but certain types of underwater creatures are also presented. In the second half of this documentary, parents protect and feed their newborns. Finish is a look at young animals leaving the house or nestling in the struggle to join the circle of life. In just 60 minutes, this feature may leave you wanting more. The sound, storytelling and video are pretty good in my opinion. No bonus features are available, with the exception of a few trailers from other programs. The chapters are a little short because of the time limit, but what is presented is nonetheless fun and enjoyable. As diverse as the animal kingdom, we hope that Reader's Digest will do more of these types of documentaries. If you are a fan of this type of subject, it is recommended to watch.""",1
"b'I am a Blu-ray enthusiast and a deadly weapon enthusiast. So, I was very disappointed at the quality of Blu-ray formatting (it looks like DVD quality), but what really pissed me off was the fact that it\'s not the cut-out directors . I guess it may have been a bit naive of me to assume that would be the case, but come on, it\'s BLU-RAY we\'re talking about here! I was not impressed. Not to mention that the seller said it was in ""Good Condition"", but the spine and the back of the sleeve were severely wrinkled and torn. If the Blu-ray conversion was of good quality and the directors had been cut, I would not have worried about the crumpled sleeve. However, as it was not the case, the crumpled nature was straw. I just checked on Amazon, and there is STILL no Director\'s Cut available. As long as there is none, I will not buy any deadly movie on Blu-ray.'",0
"b'This series is reminiscent of series such as Trigun, Full Metal Panic and Outlaw Star, nothing serious but entertaining, dramatic and funny enough to create an addiction. The first thing to do is not to take seriously most of these series if you are looking for a drama series like Ghost In The Shell, Akira, etc. he has battles of space mechas and a bit of drama for most of the series, he is mostly light for the first season. The beginning of Vandread Second Stage becomes a little more dramatic and serious, especially with the arc of history of what the people of the Earth have done to the human settlements in space for their own agenda. The main plot of the series is that after a century or so of gender separation and living on different worlds, men and women began to argue over resources and personal programs. Stories from both sides about what other genres are also make the series very funny, like when you hear the story about the male world how demonic women are and how they are going to eat your organs and are just horrible. Thus begins the clumsy journey of three men trapped on a ship of a multitude of attractive women after a chaotic gender battle that causes a fusion of male and female spaceships. The actors have a wide range of humorous situations that make you laugh throughout the series and the characters are hilarious, as you see, as they try to sometimes interact between the sexes. The real cute couple in the show was Hibiki Tokai, a third-class citizen in his world, who was basically a simple factory worker when he was trapped aboard the ship. Dita Liebely was a bubbly woman. pilot of the ship who wants to contact her first alien and as she has never seen a man before seeing Hibiki as the first alien with whom she is contacted. The video is clear and clear, so no complaints and the sound was also good. The Japanese / English actors were also very good. Again, like the last releases of Funimation, the set consists of four DVDs placed in two thin DVD cases and in a paper sleeve, the extras are not just intro / final songs without text and some bad trailers.

That being said, the DVD offers a fascinating look at the band members at the time. Some of them looked at the psychedelic era with a nostalgic penchant, while others have obviously hung and repeated for 40 years. If they had never met Janis Joplin, the story of Big Brother could have been very different - that no one had ever heard of it, or had grown up with their own blue and sharp terms, we I will never know.

"b""I bought this DVD as Christmas stockings for my husband. We watched it together in preparation for a future trip to Amsterdam. The film, which chronicles the life and struggles of the Dutch painter Vincent Van Gogh, was very well done and one of the best performances of Kirk Douglas. It was sometimes troubling because of the heartbreaking description of Van Gogh's severe mental illness. Anthony Quinn, who played the painter Paul Gauguin, and James Donald, who played Van Gogh's brother, also contributed to the pleasure of the film. The film was visually stunning and you could see the evolution of Van Gogh's art. I am looking forward to seeing Van Gogh's art in person.""",1
"b'With such power, you could reasonably have expected this film to become much brighter. Halle Berry has a friend who is killed in an unusual way, just after confiding to Berry, she was meeting and blackmailing investigative journalist Bruce Willis Halle Berry, taking along his friend Giovanni Ribisi (the best thing in the film, and the only real actor with any ambiguity) to take cover. Or under the covers, could be more appropriate. She poses online to meet him in his favorite chat room, and as a temp in his office seduces him to get close enough to know what she needs to know. Let\'s say right away - watching people type instant messages to each other is NOT exciting. And if you expect a thrill of sexual tension or action on the screen, you will probably be very disappointed. Although presented as an erotic thriller, the action is entirely internet-like and any so-called tension in the story is about variety rather than whodunwhit ... and it\'s a good thing that Willis and Berry do not get dirty, with the appalling lack of chemistry they seem to have and the lack of conviction in their roles they exude. This end is perhaps a supposed twist, but it lacks credibility to be satisfactory, as the facts all end up as a cheap trick in a funhouse, rather than a moment of reflection that gathers pieces across the film. a better scripted effort could have succeeded. Disappointing, with the ""making of .."" pretty thin as unique extra. Maybe with the ridiculously superior product replacement, they did not think they needed the film money ...'",0

The interviews are great and the backstage session with Crow and the Indigo Girls - they teach it & quot; Tried to be true & quot; - is a little gem that (as another reviewer has noted) beautifully captures the spirit of Lilith Fair. On the technical side: the camera work is wonderful, with close-ups and wide angles for what you are. In fact, I would have given 5 stars to this DVD, but for the sometimes irregular sound. I can not comment on 5.1 because I only have stereo.

"b""NOTICE: This is not really a sequel. This is one of those televised / mini-series remakes of a theatrical release. You will not get cinematographic visuals, you will get TV quality visuals. Too many people do not provide appropriate criticism and this is more a betrayal of your customers. The original Storm Riders is a fantastic fantasy tale, it's not. It's more like a standard kung-fu action movie that uses characters. Storm Riders had this fantastic feeling, but that's not the case. There is a good kung-fu action, but this thing seems incoherent as you try to watch it, and maybe it's because they tried to stick the movie together, if my theory is correct because it was an adaptation of miniseries. The story starts and stops without flow. If you just want an action movie with decent fighting scenes, do it, but it 's not at all the caliber of Storm Riders. I really want them to set a standard that differentiates TV adaptations from actual theatrical releases, such releases tend to be a little insulting.

"b""Hollywood werewolves have long been considered serious creatures who attack their victims like a Groucho Marx hirsuit. The image of this wolf-shaped werewolf was originally engraved by Lon Chaney and subsequent generations of actors simply continued his style. But with AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, director John Landis not only pushed the werewolf on all fours, he looked like nothing more than a mobile tank top, but he also added a touch of humor needed to to force the spectators to detach themselves momentarily. from the gore to contemplate what they had just seen. David Naughton and Griffin Dunne are two Americans who make their way through a dark English moor at the exit of WUTHERING HEIGHTS of Heathcliffe. They are attacked by a screaming werewolf who kills Dunne but simply bites Naughton before he is shot by the villagers himself. This introductory scene where Naughton and Dunne are banished by a group of hostile drinkers is a confusing mix of scary fear and biting wit. It is precisely this same fusion of horror and humor that suggests that the viewer engages in extremes of emotions ranging from laughter to choking, the viewer sometimes having no choice. Jenny Agutter is a very underrated actress who shines like a nurse who falls in love with Naughton, and does not understand a radical change in her eating habits as he prefers more and more his extra rare meat. Agutter adds an unexpected dimension to a role that, on the other hand, the hand of a less competent director might have relegated it to little more than an English candy. Griffin Dunne provides visceral humor like a corpse that continues to emerge, like the ghost of Hamlet 's father, at the right time to remind Naughton that the price to pay for being free of lycanthropy may be a little too high. And then there is the music, played in the same vein as Simon & amp; The words of Garfunkle from THE GRADUATE, but here, the legend of Credence Clearwater Revival & quot; Bad Moon Rising & quot punctuates the eye of scenes of transformation that make a bad moon leads to bad vibrations. Finally, the special effects of Rick Baker are amazing in that you can see the bones lengthen, the sprouting of the fur and the nostrils stretching while Naughton is as scared as the audience. In the end, AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON is a werewolf-type revolution in that sight and sound combine to present creatures as helpless in their own way, while their victims are theirs.""",1
"b'Amazon to their complete discredit posts reviews of two totally different movies in one! There are two versions of The Big Trail: a 35-mm version that lasts 110 minutes and was released in 2003, and a new large-format version released in 2008 with a duration of more than 122 minutes. The important version, to add more confusion, comes with the first as a cabinet. Potential buyers must be informed! The ""Full Screen Edition"" will confuse many buyers - in fact, it is nothing like that, so I rate it as the lowest. The film, in its historical format, deserves a FIVE STARS! and can be purchased in the game called ""The Big Trail Two Disc Special Edition"", which includes not only this lower DVD version, but also the all-important and historic ""WIDESCREEN EDITION"" version of the film as was the first time. Again, I would easily rate this five-screen DVD big screen edition! The widescreen version lasts 122 minutes and is taken directly from the original 70 mm. The ""Full Screen Edition"" presented here as it is not a cropped version of the widescreen picture, but rather a 35 mm shorter version (110 minutes) shot at the same time by Fox for most rooms movies. day that could not turn the huge movie. Yes, it\'s a real movie and certainly a good movie until you see the 70mm. My low note is to draw attention to all these important details that are not mentioned in most positive reviews. Most of what makes this epic film scale is so much better appreciated in a widescreen format, and not the full-screen, totally confusing edition as it is proposed here. Lawrence of Arabia \'\' on something less than a 60-inch screen is like watching a colored ribbon stretched in the middle of the television. Faced with such a small image, it is understandable that many people opt for cropped or ""full"" screen versions instead of widescreen versions. But the goal of ""The Big Trail"" is the magnificent GRANDEUR format, a monstrous image of the breathtaking details of the vast panoramas that make up the film\'s backdrops. These are breathtaking images, worthy of consideration with the great black and white landscape photography of the best Western photographers in the West. If you have a big screen TV, just try ""The Big Trail"" in Widescreen on the Fox ""Two Disc Special Edition"". Once you\'ve seen the movie in its entirety on a good sized screen, you\'ll wonder why Fox first released the movie ""The Big Trail"" in 2003, in a ""Full Screen Edtion"" .To order the big screen version of ""The Big Trail"" and see a milestone event of the American filmmaking, something extraordinarily spectacular.

Distortion and pixilation are sometimes ugly and really take away the pleasure of watching the race. If you compare this DVD to Le Mans DVDs covering the races of 2002 and 2003, the 2006 edition is definitely worse. Another complaint is that the DVD covers twice the highlights of the tests and qualifications, thus adding a lot of repetitions to the DVD. s 140 minutes of execution. It was a habit for the producers of this series, who participated in this show that was broadcast on the SPEED channel before its live coverage of Le Mans. This preview, which takes a little over an hour to cover tests and qualifications, gives the real beginning of the DVD, which turns into tests and qualifications. The lack of special features and onboard cameras is another disappointment. In the 2005 DVD, producers included for the first time embedded cameras (even though the DVD had slight pixilation problems). In the 2006 version, there are no special functions and the images taken by the onboard cameras do not exceed two seconds per car. It was good if the Audi R10 Turbo Diesel had a full lap in the car. Overall, I would recommend this DVD to all fans of Le Mans, as it is the best record of a race that saw Audi triumph with a diesel engine for the first time in 74 years of history. the race. He also does a good job showing all the racing action and all the drama and glamor that make up the annual endurance festival on the Circuit de la Sarthe.

"b'It\'s my fault that I was expecting more from this movie, but I guess this movie was not made for guys like me. The acting is good, the character of Matthew McConaughey, Ben and Kate Hudson, Andie, must act and react. Dialogue does not matter. The character of Kate Hudson still has the upper hand, which is good for a moment, but after an hour, it becomes tiring. She completely invades every aspect of Ben\'s life; we do not even see Andie\'s world apart from her two friends and her workplace. So, although the two characters have a similar program, there is a complete imbalance between the superiority, and this represents for me the biggest gap in the film. He supports all his attempts to ""lose"" it, but all this only produces frustration for Andie - and helps him do more crazy things. As a spectator, you\'re dying to see her fall once on her face. But it is wishful thinking. Ben \'s resilience to Andie\' s antics just distracted me and Andie \'s total lack of shame did not please me. Of course, they both look great, and Hudson shines positively when she smiles, but the man, 112 minutes, is long to endure this game. I can imagine that some people think this movie is awesome. Girl Power and everything. I do not know . But I think we can agree that the film was designed as a vehicle for the rise of Kate Hudson. This film reminds me a bit of WHAT WOMEN WANT (with Mel Gibson) for a variety of reasons, but mostly because it was written and produced by women - which, in the world of male-dominated cinema, is an indispensable prospect - but Nancy Myers producer / director of What Women\'s Want) is significantly smarter than the ""brains"" of How To Lose A Guy in 10 days. Just watch additional DVDs to see the evidence. We meet two of the producers, both of whom have obviously had facelifts. I\'m serious . It\'s scary. They talk about matter like Shakespeare\'s. Then there\'s director Donald Petrie, who has absolutely no charisma. The MAKING OF with it is so cheap that it\'s probably funnier to watch than most movies. While seated to chat, a television screen behind him triggers images of the film, and an office worker (back to the camera) stares at a static screen while biting his fingernails and shaking his head. She does this for the duration of the interviews with Petrie. Oh, and did I mention the background music that accompanies the extras? It\'s the music of department stores. Or elevator music. Whichever one you hate more. I did not care about the comment. Donald is an enemy. There is no release, which is now unusual for a comedy. The deleted scenes are actually good, honest emotions are shown by Andie and we have some quieter private moments between the two tracks. Look, it started ok. It looked like it would be a soft and harmless romantic comedy, but the romance lasted about 10 minutes. I can summarize my comment with this observation of why the director Petrie was interested in making the film. He says it was because he discovered that Kate Hudson was attached to it. Aha. So, basically, if the film is doing well at the box office, then it will launch Hudson and his career. Sorry Petrie, but that\'s not enough for me.'",0
"b'""Ring Around the Rosie"" plays Gina Philips (""Jeepers Creepers"") and Tom Sizemore (""Saving Private Ryan""). I was interested in their names, but unfortunately, the film is terribly boring, even if it lasts less than 90 minutes.Gina Philips plays Karen, a young businesswoman who inherits a house located in a remote place in the countryside be haunted. Near the house saw a guardian played by Tom Sizemore, who might or might not be possessed by something wrong. The premise is quite familiar, used recently in films such as ""The Amityville Horror"", and with the right direction, the film would be thrilling. But you will soon realize that there is no thrill, no surprise. by a sudden and big sound, in ""Ring Around the Rosie"" which presents many pieces of recycled images seen in other thrillers - rudimentary tricks like shadows moving behind the door, a strange reflection in the mirror, a strange noise at midnight or unreliable The film also looks at Karen\'s friendly boyfriend (Randall Batinkoff) and his lovely little sister (Jenny Mollen). The first leaves the house while Karen stays to clean the house; the latter arrives there and what Karen sees and intends to begin to become a stranger. Given the nature of the conclusion and the suggested story of Karen\'s childhood (which I can not divulge here), there could be psychological explanations of the strange events that terrorize Karen, such as thrillers such as The Others. ""That\'s what I thought about trying not to sleep, but no matter how I try, I can not find one in this disjointed story that is confusing and illogical. If you see a character fall from the window and another character catches him in his arms like a cartoon, you realize it\'s not a very good psychological thriller. Or maybe I think too much.

"b""The title comes from the idea that serial killers have graduate degrees in murder, although I would have thought that committing multiple acts would divert them to a postgraduate territory. The four murderers mentioned here - Charles Manson, Henry Lucas Lee, Ottis Elwood Toole and Kenneth Bianchi - receive disproportionate coverage. Manson is not seen at all, which can be a blessing considering the crazy interview that I saw him give. Henry Lee Lucas also makes a small shift, but his partner Ottis Toole may be the most troubling situation. Although convicted and jailed for what is considered an incredible 700 killings, with Lucas, Toole gives the impression that he has committed none. This does not mean that he is completely helpless, since he freely admits various acts of fire, but he claims to have confessed to the murders on the basis of the information provided by the police, that is to say that he wanted him to be guilty. The study by Kenneth Bianchi, known as Hillside Strangler, also addresses this behavior that psychiatrist Martin T Orne defines as textbook sociopathy. Although it is easy to believe that Bianchi, in his interviews, pretends, it is more difficult to accept than Toole, with his bumpkin character and his smiling facade. Maybe that makes Toole the best actor, Orne also thinks that Toole is a serial killer. Bianchi's initial defense for his murders was a multiple personality disorder, and when Dr. Orne proved to him that he was a fake, denying the testimony of other psychiatrists, Binachi abandoned the charade and was found guilty. This video was made in 1987 and it is said that Bianchi was to be released conditionally in the 1990s, which Dr. Orne thinks has a good chance of winning since Bianchi's tactics, without remorse - not of memory, has earned him alliances. . However, while Toole's face reveals an idiotic child amused by his own game, Bianchi's is the banality of evil, a bland surface that can not be trusted. The video ends with survivors of serial killers, including Sharon Tate's mother, who meet regularly to hear parole hearings of convicted murderers. One can only wonder whether they may have had an influence on Bianchi's release, since Orne predicts that once this form of obsessive / compulsive behavior is put into practice, there is no longer any way to Stop. According to Dr. Orne, regardless of the quality of prisoner Bianchi, once released, he would start again. Some may regret that these men have escaped the death penalty by being in states where the death penalty has been abolished and the idea that parole and good behavior help to dilute life imprisonment. It may seem hard, but Dr. Orne says there is no effective civilized method of deterrence - the best that can be done is to keep the perpetrators isolated from the rest of society. There are no parallels between the assassins seen here, no similarity that could possibly explain what triggered their actions.

""As a child of divorce, I spent a weekend dad who would take my sister and me to any movie, no matter the odds (well, within limits) and this one scared us . I remember sitting in the theater and watching the transformation (after seeing the transformation of Lon Chaney Jr. in ""The Wolf Man"", I knew the lineage of the genre and the example that this film had to do. ..) Seeing The Howling later (not much later, when the movies were almost competing), I was a big fan of Rob Bottin and his mentor, Rick Baker (not to mention the late Dick Smith and Master Splash, Tom Savini), I was just stuck on the screen during one of the coolest effects of all time, just impressed by what was happening, and panicked at the credibility of the transformation stop-motion of Chaney\'s makeup) not to mention the scene with David Naughton (\'be a pepper! Dr Dr Pepper!) and Jenny Agutter in bed (not to mention the shower) ... yowza! (Well, I was 11 years old) The only thing that ever aroused me about this film is the lack of what is supposed to be an extremely bloody scene that Landis cut off because she went beyond the scene that followed (supposedly, the audience was so disgusted and shocked that they were able to see the whole dialogue scene that followed David waking up in the wolf\'s pen at the zoo): the scene was the widened killings of the damned near the wharf, and I do not think it\'s happening in this new DVD version of the film (which is a disappointment, because the widened gore of Verhoven\'s Robocop (Criterion edition) is better than the version approved by the MPAA). ""movie monster"" in every sense of the word ... it\'s brutal, funny, sexy, exploiting in many ways (the book ""Splatter Movies"" calls it gore porn), really a film of Landis to force it is ""jokes"" and chaos orgy of the automobile, and it offers an excellent acting and casting (even in small roles) as the Pakistani worker at the hospital and the punks of the subway of London. Just a funny movie, with really incredible effects and winners (always impressive and credible ... nothing digital is getting closer !! I repeat: the digital is not there yet ... the transformation seems crisp, painful, horrible and stretches the imagination in more ways than one.In the end, I waited for this damn DVD forever ... the DVD of the first edition was down and it broke down so fast that I I was fortunate to find a copy of a video store for rent, no extra on that one ... but this one is the one to own.'",1
"b'The only thing that is wrong with this picture is the title. Adapted from Thomas Harris\'s novel ""Red Dragon"", it was decided to change the title. Probably think that most American moviegoers would think it\'s a Kung Fu movie or something. Probably right. This is also before the more acclaimed sequel ""The Silence of the Lambs"" by the same author. This is another great film by Michael Mann, both stylized and substantial. The style can disturb some people. It is shot with various unnatural hues, including purple, blue and green. Although they may not be realistic, they still seem to fit the scene. Mann and his photographer place cameras in interesting places. Take, for example, Hannibal Lector\'s stagnant white cell (Brian Cox). We see both Lector and Will Graham (William Petersen) centered between the same 2 bars, with quick cuts in both directions. Another camera hovers over the room. This film does not really concern Dr. Lector. This is a serial killer known as the Tooth Fairy (Thomas Noonan - really scary). As he struggles with his mental health, Petersen grabs the killer using his ability to enter the killer\'s head. He stole this theme for his television series ""Miami Vice"" at the same time. Another great tactic known to Mann is the use of music. Here we find an original score of the Reds and Michel Rubini, not to mention the incredibly cool climate scene featuring Iron Butterfly\'s In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.'",1
"b'Once in a blue moon, a crowd delight rises and raises the spirit. ""Strictly Ballroom"" is one of those films. Made in a delicious high-end style by Baz Luhrmann (ROMEO + JULIET by WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, MOULIN ROUGE) in his crazy debut (the first of what we would call the red curtain). Trilogy), the film tells the story of a first-class dancer who joins an ugly duckling left-handed, while his nonconformist style is worth the disdain of his more conventional colleagues. Together, they strive to make their dreams a national champion. To say that this film is incredible would be a euphemism. This is one of the most entertaining and impressive films ever made. The cast is simply beautiful and Luhrmann presents here his style of implementation and intelligent and fast editing. He brilliantly uses an openness of documentary style and ocassional interludes that allow to better understand the endearing characters. It works perfectly! It is certainly the film of well-being of the decade. It\'s hypnotic, strange and deeply sincere - a deliciously entertaining crowd. A must highly recommended!'",1
"b'I love the first two films of Anne of Green Gables. I first saw them on PBS and brought out the original VHS tapes by Disney. The first DVD versions of Sullivan were of very poor audio and visual quality. This new set - expensive - brings together the four films, all in 16x9. I do not like the other two films, so I will only comment on the first two. These were originally filmed in 4x3 format, with television in mind (I read that they may have played in theaters abroad). I am not an expert, but these new widescreen formats seem cut off. Thus, the information is lost with these new transfers. Is it so bad? Yes, because I think the original proportions of these films should be 4x3 (or 1.33: 1) as they were originally released. Worse still, the image quality seems to be so numerically reduced that many of the details visible at the origin are no longer visible. The sound seems ok; The default is the original 2.0 stereo mix. Unfortunately, the subtitling seems to have been done by nitwits. For the first film, the first disc (fortunately, each film has two discs) has a pretty good subtitling. The second disc contains all IN FULL CAPS subtitles, and it contains many errors. Really bad quality! ! At this price, I would not recommend to fans to buy back these movies if they are already in possession. However, as a FYI, I contacted Sullivan Entertainment and they said they did not intend to release the movies on Blu-ray.'",0

"b'A sequel to the movie ""Alien"" by director Ridley Scott was inevitable, of course. This traditional horror film, shot in outer space, was simply making too much money for the studio to let it fend for itself. Surprisingly, when director James Cameron took over, So, ""Aliens"" was adventurous, taking the story in new and exciting directions as a thread of adventure and action instead of another movie of horror. ""But now comes"" Alien 3 ""- as a useless sequel to a major movie we\'ve seen in a while.The director for the first time David Fincher and four writers have created another horror film, trying existential connotations while they make foreigners in this movie ""Moby Dick, of Ripley."" But Alien 3 starts by changing the end of his predecessor and destroys almost all the characters we care about.Fans will remember that Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Hicks, Newt and the Android Bishop escaped into a spaceship at the end of `` Aliens. \'\' But this film begins with their ejection of the ship and landing on a prison planet, which kills them all but Ripley! ""On this high-security planet, where lice infestation requires everyone to be bald, Ripley finds that the only surviving monster is still with them, and she soon organizes the prisoners to be in control. but since there is no weapon on the entire planet, they end up playing hide and seek with the creature for most of the movie. problems with this movie, but the worst is its dark and dark pattern; the absence of sympathetic characters; the annoyance of the premise of the film, which ultimately allowed Ripley to discover that she has an alien queen growing up in her; and a long chase sequence that is so dark and chaotic that it becomes confusing. Those looking for thrills or an improvement of the first films will be very disappointed. Those who are looking for a puzzle will be in the right place.And why is this ""Alien 3 (ie. Cubed)"" instead of just ""Alien 3"" or ""Alienz"" or ""Alien: One of These drooling monsters have survived after all? It\'s probably something to get writers like me to think about the issue and give the film a little more ink. It worked .'",0
"b'As many critics show, if you like this movie, you will really like it. if you hate it, you will really hate it. As I have seen twice before and am ready to see him again, you can put me firmly in the first category - I have not been so transported and moved by a movie since `` The Fountain \'\' (which evoked responses similar to love or hatred among viewers). This requires the voluntary suspension of casual cynicism, which could be a sticking point for some ... but if you are ready to open your mind and your heart even more, you will be well rewarded. simple as it should be: a thread woven through the lives of several characters, who carries them through the great events of the sixties. Richness comes in the evocation of times, in countless little details that revolve around the characters. And most importantly, in the end, it\'s a love story, beautifully told. If you have already felt the intense emotions expressed in these beautiful songs, you will identify yourself with Jude & Lucy, Sadie & JoJo and all their friends. Not just romantic love, but the sincere love of others as brothers and sisters, all together in this confusing and exhilarating world. Are there difficult moments or scenes that are a little too precious for contemporary tastes? Of course ! But that does not really matter, because one of the characteristics of the 1960s was the willingness to take ridiculous risks, to risk appearing stupid or even to fall flat on your stomach. I am happy that Julie Taymor has taken similar risks here, as it helps to capture the sensibility of that time, a sensibility that has led to considerable creativity and innovation. Are not the questions of useless war, of the demonization of the Other, of intolerance and fear of change, of mistrust of the imagination, as powerful as they are today? But while the film is really on the side of the counterculture, Julie Taymor does not hesitate to show how even the best idealistic intentions could penetrate in dark places, like some protesters going bombs. A film of peace and love, which is also very familiar with grief and despair. The film ends with the anthem ""All You Need Is Love"", a song that some have rejected without hope. naive artifact and dated power of flowers. But I remember something George Harrison once said, when he was asked if love was really all you needed - he replied that even though it was not everything. So what is the rest? Yes, it\'s a cloud of golden nostalgia shimmering and sunny in a way ... but it\'s also a reminder that there is more to life than fear and darkness, that there is hope even in the midst of madness and chaos. And in that sense, it\'s really a contemporary film, with a vital message. Very strongly, thankfully recommended!'",1
"b'I was disappointed to have this movie for the price. However, I was delighted with the expedition. I highly recommend anyone who is tempted to buy this product to save money and rent it or try to make it really cheap. The movie was not what I was hoping for.'",0
"b""This film was generally neglected upon its release. Predicting Lone Star and Thunderheart, this movie has three amazing things: (1) the cast is stellar. You get Dafoe, in a good guy role, M Emett Walsh as lazy coroner, Mary Elizabeth Mastronantino in an amazing lead role, Sam Jackson (how he figures on the end credits) ripping the scene, Mickey Roarke in a GOOD performance, and even a thankless role credited. (2) the plot is much better than No Way Out. With Donaldson's staging, you might think it would be just a remake / remake, but the plot continues to tweak, and once you think you've understood it remotely, something else is happening. product. (3) the landscape is amazing. The only film that comes closest to the Mexican landscape is Backtrack, which is also very good. The big screen adds (although it's fair to ask when it does not), so, if you were like me and you did not see it until it was released on VHS, you must make you happy. Not everything works - you always expect Dafoe to become Wild at Heart or Roarke in most of his films, but like Angelheart, he's focused and amazing here. Unfortunately, there are not many extras (maybe there is a director 's edition with Mimi Rogers, but for now, it' s a great movie - four stars out of five.""",1

"b'Okay, you think it\'s a common knowledge, but apparently not as common as we all realized. ""Starboard"" is right. \'Port\' is left. It is obvious in the direction of the helmsman that the director, the producers, the actors and the film crew are all landowners who deserve to go down with the boat. This is not the only mistake in the movie, nor the most obvious. There are many other problems in this production that have already been discussed - the fact that you know what will happen before it starts, the crew pulling the passengers, the length of the film, Leonardo DiCaprio- for name a few. Although not everyone is too distracting, taken as a whole, they make the film somewhat disgusting for those who do not like to read romance novels 24-7. Even for this purpose, romance is stupid (for want of my efforts to find a better description). The only saving grace of the case is the decor, simply spectacular. They spared no expense in building the replica of the ship, and it shows. Two stars for the sets, and nothing else.'",0
"b'A story in a story about a cruise ship - the story of the surface is a ""seven-year itch"". A British, honest and respectable, childless couple, who celebrates this generous birthday, is advised unscrupulously (regarding the husband anyway) by an Indian sage that children are a better marriage therapy than a cruise in India . Lust takes over the seemingly conservative Brit, perfectly played by Hugh Grant and ridicules him. Yes, it happens to men all the time. The British couple met the sexy French siren and her crippled, elderly husband who tells the story of the British husband to tell his autobiographical novel ever published. As for the writer\'s inner story and his French obsession, it shows how much the ""greed"" of the hedonistic fantasy can lead to a dark, sadistic or at least regrettable behavior. In other words, everyone learns this lesson in their own way. A subtle theme is the representation of the writer in check, who buys the fantasy too strongly and tries to make life imitate art until his life and his art all succeed, (like the thirst for seven years men, is another truism - the failed artists often go too far in fantasy, abandoning the realism that ultimately causes frustration and failure) that completely misses his point of view and is ready to cash his life perfectly respectable for a sadly scandalous brief in the very way that made the cripple a loser so odious and so odious. Just like Homer\'s siren song (which was also cruising in the Mediterranean, is not it?). Great score of Vangelis too, capturing romance and tragedy in a theme.'",1
"b'Like another reviewer, I can not load the DVD on my Toshiba SD-1200 drive. I have a lot of DVDs and I watched a lot of rentals and I did not have any problems like that before.

Just disappointed.'",0
"b""This criticism only concerns blu-ray, because there are many critics about the film itself and there are so many ways to say that the film is great. I was a bit skeptical about this blu-ray because I had read that it was not really an upgrade from the Jane Doe edition. Technically, that might be true, but the truth is that it's the best Fletch ever had and could have. I do not know if they can invent a format that can infuse an exaggerated life into a comedy from the mid-1980s that was not originally planned / budgeted to be a visual show. Yes, this movie does not look like The Departed on blu-ray, but it's an improvement over the DVD and that's really all you can ask for. For $ 10, it's hard to beat and for me, it's obvious if you're a fan of the film.""",1
"b""I recommend this movie for adults and children. It has something interesting for all age groups. The southwest landscape is beautiful and impressive, as the story takes place in the desert of southwestern Arizona, on Navajo lands. There is also a story of two young boys who lost their goats, and they think she wandered in a canyon known as & quot; Cougar Canyon & quot; a place that is supposed to be haunted, according to Navajo legend. They have to go after the goat, of course, and face many dangerous mishaps before successfully completing their mission. The real stars of this film, however, besides the beautiful landscapes, are the superb photographs of the desert fauna in its natural habitat. There is a battle between a badger and a cougar, or a wild cat, more commonly known, with a surprise ending. The close-ups of a diamond rattle snake are awesome, and the narration is superb too. This film is reminiscent of the old documentary series Disney Nature Documentary, released years ago in the 70's. I really enjoyed it, and I'm an older person, but I can see where it would appeal to kids too, because they are usually fascinated by wild creatures such as rattlesnakes, wildcats, black bears, etc. in their natural environment. It's actually very educational, especially for city dwellers. I can not say enough good things about this movie, you just have to see it for yourself.""",1
"b'The critic who implements it directly in these pages is the one who cites the fact that Jonathan Larson designed \'Rent\' as more opera (using ""La Boheme"" as a source of inspiration), and not as a musical . And what that means is that the connection dialogue is sung on stage, and not as a dialogue. So, see Jesse L. Martin forced to speak like ""I remade the ATM cable to the Food Emporium"" when we know that it kills him not to sing it and that it kills all the fans of Rent to force him to simple mouthing words ... well, it\'s a major flaw because it inflicts major blows to the flow and energy of Larson\'s work.Other concerns: * The first half of the piece unfolds little close by blow. Then, oddly (considering the fidelity in the first half), the second half deviates a lot from the original. The director Columbus is wasting too much time in staging ""Take Me or Leave Me"" in a way that is not planned. Fun, no doubt, but the extra 5-10 minutes he talks about here could have been used to keep the deleted scenes intact. * Deleted scenes are not fundamental issues - ""Rent"" is a difficult story to follow for the unitized. Each of these scenes could have helped to explain the scenario. One of the reasons to support ""Take Me or Leave Me"" was to have more Idina Menzel. [Menzel (the original elphaba in ""Wicked"" and the original Maureen here) rose to Broadway royalty, so who can blame Columbus? ] But if so, why leave out a good year? which has a good amount of Maureen? * Deleted scenes eventually bring the Mark of Anthony Rapp into disrepute, which is unfortunate because it is the voice and the thread of the play. Leaving its\' 3D IMAX of my mind ... it\'s poetic ... this pathetic number is an important mission, both for Rapp as an actor and for anyone trying to follow the film - it\'s the centerpiece puts things in perspective for the viewer in time. Why else would Larson have tried to put lines in Rapp\'s soliloquy, entitled ""Christmas ... last Christmas Eve""? He frames us. It would be a criticism of three stars, but I four because of the redemptive nature of the beautiful documentary about the Larson family - it\'s very powerful. It is obvious that the family still suffers deeply 10 years after its loss.'",1

One would think that no one in this film had any training because everyone is out of shape and hence for combat choreography. There is no good soundtrack and the music they play is boring.

After repeated attacks on herself, in desperation, she seeks a protector and finds a mysterious Russian officer (Evgeny Sidikhin) with a haunted past.

The Russians, in general, long for their family, hate the war that has dragged them on, and recount horrible memories of the atrocities committed by the Germans on their homeland. Paying evil for evil does not correct their actions, but I suppose it brings a kind of balance and understanding to the story. Fortunately, assaults are not presented, but that's about all for the graphic shoot. But we receive the message. The whole movie is depressing. I think the only feeling of hope comes from the heroine's desire to survive, to keep her sanity and sense of decency, whatever. The written epilogue is almost as disturbing.

Once past the idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8ba virus affecting someone this way and spreading so quickly, the rest of the plot seemed perfectly logical. The few questions I had were easily discussed on a beer with my friends. When I heard that they were doing a sequel, I am very excited and mark my schedule. The opening night, the first time after I left work, I was there. Three hours later, I banged my head on a table and wondered if there was enough beer in the world to understand what I had just seen. ""28 Weeks Later"" should become a case study in film schools on how to take all the best in an amazing movie and set it aside for the future. As mentioned in other reviews, the holes in the plot are huge and relentless. My ""favorites"" being: 1) children leave the safe area and we even see soldiers in the guard tower let them go, 2) no one monitors or monitors the infected (but not symptomatic) survivor, 3) her husband is stupid enough to kiss her and 4) no matter how many blocks the boy runs through frantically, his father ""Raged-Out"" appears quickly and attacks him and him alone. I was particularly eager to see the virus spread through a crowd, as told in the first movie. Nope . When he hits the fan in the station, what happens? The lights go out and we get a lot of fast, stroboscopic shots. Hey, thanks. Unless you are epileptic, you are not afraid. I give two stars mainly because I could not give seven days.

It was a film that attracted me from the beginning and never let me go until the end of the credits. I\'m looking forward, now, to see the following ""Evolution of the underworld"". If you only get one sci-fi / horror movie on Blu-Ray, consider this movie with serious attention. This film will certainly be a movie that I watch a lot more than once. Once, I would note this film 4 and 3/4 stars An option.'",1
"b'I was very disappointed when I saw that what I received in the mail was a price-priced DVD for the usual price (by A2ZCOS instead of a studio). What I expected happened. This is the only DVD my reader has ever read. Firstly, a message was sent by A2ZCOS stating that the film was old and that the sound quality could be lower than expected. Then the DVD player stalled and said that the DVD was ""dirty"" and that he was unable to read it. I really do not expect Amazon to sell this garbage, but I guess I should check from now. As for the film, it\'s one of the greatest movies of all time. - - - I really think that Amazon owes me for the waste, but it does not matter.'",0

"b""There are some pleasant surprises in this film: Tori Spelling's comical ability, beautiful original music, pretty cast, and premises full of comic possibilities - two cute guys from New York trying to make love. But it would take a lot of writing and character development to make it a wild joke. Well tried, though, and there are rewards. Gabriel (Christian Campbell), an aspiring songwriter with a quirky smile, takes Mark (John Paul Pitok), a dark and seductive Go-Go Dancer (does he really call them that?) The subway. It's his fantastic man (rightly) who comes to life. The two men return to Gabe 's apartment where they find her sparkling and egocentric actress (Spelling), an actress, who prints 150 CVs. It's planned for a lot of auditions, is not it? This is the first in a long series of frustrating attempts to be alone, and while there are fun times to be sure, the comic results are debatable. The roommate presents himself with his own tower and throws them. In their constant quest for intimacy, they meet a queen of Broadway, a drag queen and other characters, all more absorbed than each other. And they call the 70s the & quot; me & quot; decade! Absolutely no one notices that Mark and Gabe, holding hands and waving and hinting, might want to be alone. Gabe can not blow his horn and say it. It's like an extended sitcom episode. To top it off, after spending a whole night getting to know Mark, with beautiful private moments en route, Gabe insults him by acting like it's just a ride. Mark, in real life, is much more tolerant and kind than a handsome guy is likely to be in real life, so it looks like things will go well. It's worth it to just watch for the cute cast. I deserved only three stars, but that made four.""",1
"b""Based on a true story, Nigel Cole's CALENDAR GIRLS is a whimsical, touching but sometimes trivial film. Trivial only in the fact that there are many times when nothing really important happens, and the crisis points are predictable and exaggerated. But a delicious cast always manages to entertain. The idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bwomen over 50 in nature is difficult to understand, but these ladies are so elegantly attractive and the calendar set with great taste, we can not help but be caught when the calendar becomes a success international. for a long time an Oscar, brings his role of Chris, the instigator of the calendar, to a wonderful achievement. Ciaran Hinds (The sum of all fears, Lara Croft Cradle of Life) is very good, her husband whose comments on a sneaky journalist cause a break in their marriage. Julie Walters (Oscar nominated several years ago for Educating Rita) paired Mirren in her role as a widow whose death is inspired by the husband. The other ladies, Annette Crosbie and Penelope Wilton in particular, are all very accomplished in their performances. Not a film that shakes the earth, but a film that proves that beauty is not relegated to the young, perhaps the youngest.""",1
"b""Before seeing The Girl Next Door, I was expecting it to be a scorching teen sex movie. After watching it, it became one of my favorite movies, if not my favorite. It is a story of love and a comedy. Emile Hirsch plays Matthew Kidman, a high school student who is a great student and a good kid, but he is a bit cheesy and did nothing memorable. throughout high school. This changes when he meets his new neighbor Danielle, played by Elisha Cuthbert. Danielle is beautiful and Matthew instantly falls for her. Shortly after spotting her, he sees her undressing through the window and can not help but watch. Danielle catches her looking at her and becomes angry at first, but it seems that she has fallen in love with him soon. Danielle is a former porn star, whom Matthew discovers only when his friend Eli (played by Chris Marquette) shows him video with her in it. To make matters worse, Kelly, former producer and ex-girlfriend of Danielle (played by Timothy Olyphant), comes one day and wants Danielle to return to the world of adult cinema. Kelly and Matthew get along well at the beginning, but that changes when Matthew tries to get Danielle out of the porn industry, which Kelly does not like at all. Eli and Kelly are two characters who really steal the show in this movie. Eli is Matthew's high school friend who is excited and obsessed with sex and hot women. He had some of the funniest lines of the entire movie. Kelly (the director who worked with Danielle and who was dating her) is the cool and wise guy who cracked me in just about every scene in which he was. I could not decide to love him or hate him - he's a nice and cool guy when he and Matthew are friends, but when Matthew makes him angry, he becomes psychopathic and violent. I do not want to say too much in this film, but Danielle asks Matthew to do things he never imagined doing. It 's really an opposing affair that attracts: Matthew falls in love with Danielle' s wild adventure, and Danielle falls into Matthew 's innocence and purity. In many scenes, we can say basically that Danielle is really a good person, she does not really want to be part of the porn world, and she really cares about Matthew. Matthew feels the same about Danielle and gets into a lot of risky situations for her. This film was so touching that I cried in two parts and did not cry easily. Still, there were also so funny parts that I could not stop laughing (mostly scenes with Eli and Kelly).""",1
"b'I do not understand why other countries have all 4 seasons available and not the United States. This is a great show and should be available here. I have most of the shows recorded on the television, but I would like to have a box set of this show.'",0
"b""It's still one of my favorite shows to date. I really like to see episodes again and again. This is the second in last season and is one of the best seasons. Obviously, over the years, children grow up and grow up and that creates interesting situations. In the episode Fast Friends, Steph hangs out with the kids who smoke and makes her feel obliged to do the same. I also like The Apartment where Steve buys an apartment and DJ sleeps on the couch. Danny finds her (after her late homecoming) and gets very angry.Full House is such a sight that I'm sure young children would still like to do it, and that older kids like me continue to love because I I grew up watching him. There has never been a cooler (or nicer) uncle than Uncle Jesse, and love between the whole family is awesome and fun to watch. This is one of the best seasons and any fan should have it in his collection.""",1
"b""You think Hollywood would have no problem making a film about Hollywood. Think again. Certainly, there have been some great photos in which Hollywood is looking at himself. The oldest I can think of is A Star is Born, from 1937, which was redone in 1954, an even better movie. 1950 Sunset Boulevard is one of the greatest movies ever made, and a few years later, Singin 'in the Rain, a classic musical. Yet, over the years, the industry has produced more bad movies about itself than the good ones. Lovers of America are somewhere in between. Its beginning is rather promising, but it weakens and disappears thereafter. Lee [Billy Crystal] is a Hollywood press agent who has big problems. His boss, Dave [Stanley Tucci], needs him to promote the new film starring Gwen Harrison and Eddie Thomas [Catherine Zeta-Jones and John Cusack]. The couple was the hottest and most popular couple in America, and audiences flocked to see their movies. Now that they are on the verge of divorce and can no longer stand, they are box office poisons. Lee must find a way to convince the press that Gwen and Eddie are recovering together without the two stars knowing what he's doing. He asks for help from Gwen's sister, Kiki [Julia Roberts], who is not only unhappy with Gwen's order but secretly in love with Eddie. Then there is the problem of the film itself. All the studio has seen is the opening credits. The director [Christopher Walken] does not want to show it until he makes some changes. These changes will result in a film very different from the one that the studio paid for $ 86 million. As I read the synopsis above, I discover how much America's Lovers have been fun and insightful. The plot leaves room for farce and satire, but the authors did not take advantage of the opportunity. Instead of being brilliant, fragile and insightful, the story is rather cute, disgusting and tame. Most chances for Hollywood to laugh at itself are wasted. The same goes for Julia Roberts. Although I'm finally able to respect her, I do not think she's right in Jane's role. In addition, she has most often done the ugly duckling. The film is primarily a vanity project for Billy Crystal, who also produced it, and for the director Joe Roth, who used it to launch his new company, Revolution Studios. They were probably afraid to upset the Hollywood establishment they are part of, too. If your mind wanders while watching a movie, it usually means it does not grab you. There are several scenes in American darlings where a character says something and everyone in the room gasps. I started to think about it. In all my life, I have never known anyone who can say to all listeners, and I have known very neat people. It's something that only happens in movies. Then I started listing in my head other things you only see on celluloid. Before I knew it, the movie was over.""",0
"b""At the time of its release, Hostel caused a lot of controversy and aroused a series of audience reactions. Many have reacted with hatred to the violent and indestructible nature of the film. My problem with this is not violence. I can not connect to the first part of the film, which focuses on the insane behavior of men hiking in Central Europe. All this becomes a long wait to see what awaits in the second half, and it provides very little evidence for what we will have to endure. All the violence of the film is hard, personal and disturbing. It's not fun, but in a broader sense, quite interesting. You are wondering about the world and the dark places where everything or anyone can be bought at the right price. This DVD contains very good performances and, overall, a very good set of extras, including a featurette almost entirely about the inspiration and reaction for the film, and how much of that is based in reality. Eli Roth is certainly a smart man, and he's ready to say a message, not just shocking, but because of the harshness and harshness of the film, it's hard to digest, and it's too uncomfortable to be really memorable . There may be a little too much truth in Hostel.""",0
"b'TETSUJIN 28 is a Japanese action film based on Mitsuteru Yokoyama\'s manga series, better known in the West for its 1963 animated black-and-white adaptation that appeared on American television in 1966 as `` Gigantor . There are some pretty spectacular scenes of two giant robots, Tetsujin 28 and Black Ox, strolling through the streets of Tokyo and falling into the skyline, including a heartbreaking movement where Black Ox rises to the top of the tower from Tokyo. There is even a good place where Black Ox launches the disabled Tetsujin in the Diet building (Parliament). These sequences are quite exciting and well done, as if the cameras were on the scene and took the action as it unfolded. Unfortunately, the two subsequent fights do not deliver the goods. The punches thrown are quite weak and there is not much movement in the fighting. Robots never fly and fight in the air, even though, by the final encounter, they both have that power. The original animated series had a lot more giant robot action than we have here. Even worse, the young Shotaro, who has been designated to pilot the remote device that controls Tetsujin, never seems to want to do it. He is weak and scared for most of the film. When he finally accepts his role at 90 minutes, which is way too long for us to wait, he is not particularly effective. While the boy playing Shotaro may offer a realistic portrayal of the reaction of a ten-year-old child in the circumstances, I must admit that I was not exactly looking for realism. I wanted the boy to be packed and eager to control this powerful robot and send him into a furious fight to end Black Ox\'s depredations. Exactly how Shotaro (or ""Jimmy Sparks"" as he was known in ""Gigantor"") behaved in the original manga and anime. Or the heroes of the movie ""Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot"" and the 1960s Gamera movies. These new Japanese heroes are really thin when put to the test (see also Toru in GAMERA THE BRAVE and Tadashi in THE GREAT YOKAI WAR, two films also made in 2005, and both also on this site). What do you say about the next generation of Japanese heroes? At least Ash of `` Pok\'\' My \'\' still knows what to deal with a threat. I did like one aspect of the movie, though. I loved seeing two idols of Japanese pop music in the cast. The oldest is Hiroko Yakushimaru, who was popular in the 1980s and starred in a film I remember, entitled SAILOR SUIT AND MACHINE GUN (1981). She plays Shotaro\'s mother and she is very beautiful. The other is one of my favorite pop pop singers, Yuko Nakazawa, one of the founding members of Morning Musume, here a young police officer assigned to the case. They give her short brown hair and a rather plain navy suit, clearly an attempt to minimize her usual glamor, but she has a lot to do and it\'s always a pleasure to see her in action. Another key female character is Mami Tachibana (played by Yu Aoi), an MIT robotics expert recruited to help refurbish Tetsujin 28 after a disastrous battle in the beginning. She is young and brave and looks very uniform and beret when she befriends young Shotaro. The score of Akira Senju is nice and melodic and keeps things optimistic when the film slows down (which is often the case). I also have the CD of the soundtrack. The end music mixes with the chorus of the male chorus singing the 1963 theme song ""Tetsujin 28"", accompanied by shots of the original manga, which seems much more action-packed than anything in this film. The Pioneer / Geneon DVD does not offer credits in English anywhere except on the DVD case.'",0

The eight-year-old girl who saw her to the end (she always does, no matter what!) Was often distracted and her five-year-old brother was bored and leaving the room before the scary parties forced us to turn off the band. 3) Attempts to make the story appealing to young children by adding animal characters further confuse the plot and make the story unrecognizable to anyone like me who has read and enjoyed the book.

"b""It was a very interesting film. In fact, it is NOT banned in Singapore. I saw this film while living there and it was a real relief. Although the film focuses on street thugs, the general theme is that of the forgotten people of Singapore who can not be doctors, lawyers or friends of gahment (government). Students are simplified at a very young age and some bad tests mean that you are grouped with the dregs. This film shows what is happening in Singapore on one side that many Sinagporeans do not know. 5 stars for audacity. Cinematography is difficult (unstable) at times and the plot of the story jumps a bit ... but it's still very convincing.""",1
"b'If you liked the first, it\'s okay.I say it mainly because the tone (darker than many mainstream movies), the occult nature and the unusual imagery tend to extinguish some moviegoers. But if you just want to see a movie about a demon that has been raised by humans to fight evil, it\'s a great movie for you. Guillermo del Toro\'s leadership style is very kinetic and fluid. This helps keep the film moving, preventing it from feeling as if it is dragging. The scenes go very well from one to the other (which is also very good with wipes and creative overlays). The real appeal of this film, however, is Hellboy and the team that has been provided. Ron Perlman is the absolutely perfect Hellboy. His delivery of the lines is just perfect to create a sharp character, but ultimately adorable (and also loving). He has an ironic humor about him that makes Hellboy something that we can all refer to. We have all had moments when we feel under appreciated. We all felt like unwanted strangers. Yet, despite all the incentives he had to give up on defending these humans, he continues to do so because that\'s what his ""father"" taught him to do. Of course, Abe and Liz are also present, as well as Doug Jones and Selma Blair doing an excellent job of portraying their respective characters. But it\'s not their movie. It is interesting, however, to see one of the elements of the story of the first film turn around to portray the other side of it when the team meets the angel of death. In short, as I said above, if you liked the first, it\'s just your kind of movie. I can not wait to see what del Toro has in mind for the third film. (Of course, you\'ll have to wait until he finishes `` the Hobbit \'\'.)'",1
"b'Former government agent Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) must solve the mystery of the events that took place as a child to save the planet from destruction by monsters from another dimension.OK, I admit, ""Alone in the dark"" does not appear on my best movies of all time, but it\'s not my worst movie list either. It can be directed by Uwe Boll, considered by many to be the worst director of all time, but if all the other Boll films are like that, then Boll was grossly underrated because I saw a lot of movies that are much worse than this one (for example, the remake of ""The Stepford Wives""). The script is based on a video game, which gives it the ""video game"", going from level to level, getting with a lot of movies of this type (such as ""Resident Evil"" or ""Doom""), but that does not did not put out of the movie like making me want to play and play the game. Not being a player, it was my first encounter with ""Alone in the Dark"" and I found the story interesting enough to maintain my interest in the movie. The game is of unequal quality. Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff (as other government agent) both offer decent performances, but Tara Reid is not convincing as a scientist, which adds to the entertainment value of the film. My main criticism is that some of the battle scenes are too long. There is a fight scene at about 1 hour that includes about 15 minutes of people shooting at monsters with very little dialogue, which has become tedious after a while. Despite that, I have always loved the film and I would be ready to see it again.'",0

"b'My son absolutely loves the book I Stink! So when I saw this animated version available, I knew it would go all right. The people of Schoolastic have an excellent track record of animating classic children\'s books, and this is no exception. I Stink was animated in a way that perfectly complements the illustrations in the book, and Andy Richter, a Conan sidekick, does a fantastic job of giving the floor to a garbage truck ""all in attitude, all the time"". The animated version of I Stink is almost as popular with my son as the book. The DVD also includes some other animated adaptations that (somehow) deal with the topic of garbage trucks. Trashy Town is the only other story on the DVD, but with its simple animation and catchy chorus, it went very well. The others are mean. Arnie the Donut was funny and a little disturbing (it is a conscious pastry conscious of its impending demise), but Monsieur Racine \'s Beast was just a little too strange.

"b'While for me, ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" remains the most beautiful Masterpiece Theater series of all time, this one takes the second. Gemma Jones is superb like Louisa Trotter, the Cockney Cook / Hotelienne who never loses her sense of common sense or her heavy cockney accent even after being stewardess of Edwardian England \'s Rich and Famous. The first episodes focus on the rise of Louisa, assistant cook to mistress of the Prince of Wales (future King Edward VII). But most of the series concerns the activities of Bentinck Hotel, an exclusive private London property managed by Louisa. With a few exceptions, the family must have been registered with Debrett\'s Peerage for at least 100 years before being able to book a room at the Bentinck. And yet Louisa\'s selectivity is not so much a reflection of snobbery as her passionate commitment to being the best in everything she does. The entire series is rich in characters and incidents, and in fact Jones / Louisa is well back in several episodes. But she is undoubtedly the dominant and dominant character of this series. You did not see the unbridled outrageous outrage until you saw Louisa, in the last episode of this collection, testify at trial on behalf of her friend, Lord Haslemere, pouring out a diatribe in all his glory of cockney.

"b'Without doubt, it\'s the funniest holiday movie. The real test of a good comedy is to be able to still scream about the film years later, and on ""Christmas Vacation"", more than that for me. But it works in reverse: instead of traveling abroad in countries like Europe or Wally World, the Griswolds are prone to disaster, and timing approach the Christmas days. Chevy Chase is clearly in her element here by resuming her well-meaning but desperately klutzy matriarch role, Clark, who naturally goes too far in creating ""the perfect Christmas"". The trusty Beverly D\'Angelo is also Clark\'s support woman who is being pimpled by annoying parents and children, as well as her husband. The late John Hughes stuffs holiday and reference satire script. with the brand ""Lampoon"" slapstick & lowbrow humor. Admittedly, sometimes the tanks of humor, but it is a more noble effort than the previous uneven ""European holidays"".

Find familiar faces Juliette Lewis & Johnny Galecki (the latter currently on the hit sitcom ""The Big Bang Theory"") as children Griswold; Julia Louise-Dreyfuss, pre-Seinfeld, was half of her posh neighbors who were suffering at the hands of Clark; and Doris Roberts, Diane Ladd and William Hickey while some of the troublesome parents come to visit.

"b'Having played both games ""BloodRayne"", I am a fan of the series. So when I heard that they were making a movie, I was rather interested. But deep within me, I knew it was probably going to fall. I was more than fair. Unless you are interested in a harvest so terrible that it makes you laugh, DO NOT BUY THIS FILM! It\'s a total disaster! Movie Rayne has nothing to do with his video game counterpart. The fighting scenes were slow, nothing to do with the fluidity of the game. And do not get me into trouble ... I saw better setups in a haunted house. Nothing has been done realistically, and the ten minute recap at the end of the film (which was done for a reason that I will never understand) only shows how negligible it is. The game was not great either, and the brief sex scene ... let\'s just say that I found myself laughing through most of this mess. Needless to say, the plot was also missing (and it is lightly). If you want a vampire movie, choose the ""Underworld"" movies. If you\'re a fan of ""BloodRayne"" looking for something to satisfy your fandom, try the game again. You\'ll get more satisfaction than this horrible version.'",0
"b'The Italian Job is the best film ever made, without a shadow of a doubt. In general, I agree with Leonard Maltin, but sometimes he is out of reach and he is certainly in this case. Well, you might think that the characterization is bad, but they are supposed to be stereotypes. Before the birth of Kevin Williamson and his ilk, this film was ironic. It should be noted that the British censors of 1968 would not allow the release of any film suggesting that crime was paying off. If you only buy one video from Amazon (and that would not be a good thing - they have a wide variety of quality movies - could I personally recommend The Quiet Man, for example?), Make it this one.'",1

"b""For years, I did not care too much about movies, without much love for Hollywood drones. But since I have a DVD player, I also found myself at the cinema. What a treat to see SNATCH. Writing brilliantly funny, superbly executed by the actors, realistic dialogue, credible characterizations. Fast moving, carefully interwoven subplots, flowing brilliant, overall superb. I came out of the cinema by making fun of myself while enjoying a scenario that is both simple to follow and complex in makeup. Guy Ritchie did a great job on that, the cast was superbly chosen, even Brad Pitt, which so far has not been one of my favorites. I have now also bought the DVD, two discs, loads of extras, I have watched it four times, I can not look, my ribs do not support the punches they take. I recommend it to everyone. For our American cousins, I think it's only recently been released, go see it now, you'll love it.""",1
"b""As a lover of ancient history, I was excited to watch another film about Cleopatra's life. This film is extremely glamorous and seems to follow the script of an old soap opera rather than the life of the last queen of ancient Egypt. Filmmakers obviously did not create this as a factual account of Cleo's life. The comedy Billy Zane (Antony) and Timothy Dalton (Caesar) was very good, and Lenor Varella (Cleopatra) offers a good show, if you like passion and exaggerated drama. If you want to see a fictional and modern TV view of Cleopatra's life, it's your movie, but Cleopatra's film with Elizabeth Taylor is far superior.""",0
"b""... well, frankly, it's a real tragedy. But if you do, then that's it! It's still my favorite classic black and white movie of all time (followed very closely by CITIZEN KANE, hey, I had to pick one, no?)! This movie is the reason why I have a DVD player in the first place. Nothing is as beautiful and as clean as classic black and white cinema. It was the first DVD I bought! Like a Honda car, this movie speaks for itself, so I will not waste time questioning every commendable word that could be said. Let me only say that when AFI recently made its list of the 100 best cinema lines of all time, CASABLANCA was chosen most often (6 times).""",1
"b'In simple terms: Style over substance. There are some excellent sequences, but that\'s all that this movie seems to be, well-planned and executed sequences - but nothing coherent sticking together. The ""crash plane and the last-minute rescue"" are extremely impressive and the machine gun ammunition coming out of Supe\'s chest, followed by the bullet in the eyes, is beautiful. My jaw dropped and I almost wanted to applaud. This is what Superman is talking about: seeing him defeat the bad guys in a new, attractive, even fun way. But that was where the pleasure ended. Like what Superman is not sure about, it\'s the children\'s love and ridiculous heroics with kryptonite. I find that both are so implausible that they both must be ridiculed. As Brodie (played by Jason Lee in Kevin Smith\'s Mallrats) points out, ""It\'s impossible! Lois Lane has never been able to have Superman\'s baby. Do you think that his fallopian tubes could support his sperm? I guarantee you that when he comes during sex, he will probably explode like a gunshot ... on his back. ""Apart from the fact that Lois Lane is alive after coitus, you would then have the impossibility for a human being to conceive and bring to term the child of a stranger. Remember that the fact that Clark Kent looks and acts ostensibly like a human is an alien. He is a completely different species. And entirely different species can not mate. Just think of the ravages it would cause in the animal kingdom if a lion fell in love and mated with a crocodile. Or a guinea fowl. The other problem that thrills me with anger is the Cretinist concept of Superman\'s physical ability to lift a whole continent of kryptonite into space. As the internet blogger dpogue21 says (much better than I could not - so thank you) in his imdb review, ""My next big problem is that Superman is raising a continent of kryptonite in space. It does not take the Simpson cartoon guy to say what\'s wrong with that. I do not know how many comics Bryan Singer has read, but when Superman is exposed to a small amount of kryptonite, he hardly has the strength to stay upright. Anyone who has had the idea to fly a large island with its greatest weakness in space is no longer dealing with projects related to Superman. The concept is as ridiculous as making a Dracula movie where the main character has a stake in his heart and still manages to fly a garlic spacecraft in the sun. Why not just Superman eating kryptonite? He can eat it and brush his teeth with him, then go sleep in kryptonite pajamas. It is no more absurd to have a continent of kryptonite hoisted into space, then let it fall into the atmosphere without burning back or splashing the central park when it hits the ground. \'\' Do I need to say more? I did not mean it. ** [...]'",0
"b'The special effects were ok, but the story was weak, stupid and predictable. As a child, I loved Alien movies. Aliens (the 2nd) is considered a classic in our house because we continue to laugh at the way my mom rained M & M on the stage after a stranger scared her. So, with that, I was excited to see this movie and relive some memories. What a desappointment. It was not scary at all. The people at the theater were actually *** SLEEPING ***. I was jealous of them. I was especially happy that it was a short film. Unfortunately, the most frightening thing in this movie was a penguin. Do not see it. If you are a big fan of alien or predator and you have to catch it, wait for the video or HBO.'",0
"b""Peter Brooks 's spartan adaptation of William Golding' s immortal novel about a group of English schoolchildren stranded on a desert island still lives nearly four decades after its initial release. Despite the total absence of star names and limited production values, the film succeeds thanks to the performances of children's actors and to a general primitivism that makes everyone credible. At first, shipwrecked people do not seem to have it so badly; there is a lot of food, no adults and no predators ... except maybe one, one & quot; beastie & quot; it could be a strange animal or a ghost or something worse ... A moving and ever poignant indictment of inherent human savagery, Lord of the Flies translates the essence of Golding's tale to the screen. Like many adults, children think they are good enough to make their own utopia. Too bad for utopia. So much for the innocence of childhood.""",1
"b""Max Beesley did it. His chemistry and Mariah's were electric. I smiled, laughed and cried. The first time I saw it is Ok, but times 2-10, I keep seeing something new every time.

"b'Poor Bellini! Out of fashion for a century and saved from near-darkness by the genius of Maria Callas, it was destroyed by this horror. What should we do with Zimmerman\'s absurd production? Bellini in a kind of big city office loft, the characters, the action at the height of the romantic score of bel canto, the opera reduced to a near farce. This could have been saved by a higher song, but even that is missing. It\'s as if the singers were wondering, ""What is nonsense and why are we here! `` Every opera performance should be a homage to the composer but in this case it is nothing but an obedience to the director and her obvious necessity must be considered disturbing, scandalous and inventive. One can only shudder to think of what she has in store for future opera performances (if any). Can we wait for his Norma in Detroit, a metaphor for the collapse of downtown?

Do not get me wrong, it\'s good to see guys play again, and watch Kim get sober on the way, wander around the cities, and so on. But the main problem with this doc is that it\'s absolutely boring. And they grope the key issues in all the minds of real fans: the reasons for the break and the possibility of new music. In fact, the best part of this movie (aside from the music) is the impromptu interviews of Kelly fans. She begins to ask questions! What a concept! This is a lost opportunity. The filmmakers were either incompetent or too marked and ""honored to be chosen"" to make a film of any depth. We are left with a lazy love letter, fly-on-the-wall. Tiptoe filmmaking.Look, I love all things Pixies. Period. And at a certain level, it\'s a pleasure to see just because I like that group so much.

"b'From the trailer and Julia Roberts\' presence in the cast, I went to CLOSER while waiting for a light romantic comedy. (My preconceptions have not been so broken since I saw Bambi\'s mother being shot by hunters on Saturday night). CLOSER opens as Alice (Natalie Portman), a New York stripper visits London a car after looking left instead of out of the sidewalk. She is taken to the hospital by a stranger, Dan (Jude Law), a writer who could start a live relationship. Dan then sits for an official portrait of photographer Anna (Julia Roberts), to whom he has failed. Thereafter, Larry (Clive Owen), a dermatologist, meets Anna, whom he marries, then divorces after discovering that she had had recent sexual intercourse with Dan, once scorned. On the rebound and in need of physical comfort, Larry looks for Alice, polishing clothes at a London striptease club after leaving Dan, and whom he had already met at a photo exhibition. Anna. But Dan still loves Alice and is emotionally devastated to have sex with Larry. Is it messy or what? (The weather is dark, apparently all this has been happening for a few years.) CLOSER is a painful film to watch, of sexual manipulation, possession and obsession, in which the four main characters influence each other. It\'s not a vacation for an afternoon at the movies with your old mom. The language is sexually graphic and, in a sequence of scenes from the London Strip, visually hot. CLOSER is however one of the best films of 2004. Julia Roberts is perhaps the biggest surprise because she shows that she can transcend radically - even beyond ERIN BROCKOVICH (2000) - her usual cute roles; I was strongly impressed. It would be difficult to choose the lead of this film and the support parts. All four (Portman, Law, Roberts, Owen) have about the same screen time (even if I did not follow the stopwatch). Some or all of them could win an Oscar nomination. I had begun to doze about a quarter of the length of the film, but then I woke up almost when I realized that CLOSER is an exceptional adult film, with no visual explanation. sex or violence, which brutally shows adults in dysfunctional relationships behaving at their worst. Really, as a line in KINSEY indicates: ""Sex is a dangerous game. If you are not careful, it can open you completely. \'\''",1

I do not know why, but the five seasons are available in the UK, and I thought Ally McBeal was one of the most enjoyable TV shows in years and was sad when it was canceled. The abbreviated cabinet available in the United States using the NTSC format is quite that - abbreviated, and can not do justice to a big series. As an American, I think we deserve better.

"b""Beginning in the late 1950s, there was a series of country music movies, perhaps in response to the successful series of B rock and roll movies around the same time. Most of them had a kind of plot involving rubes that ran into all kinds of problems. But these movies are not just the wacky hi-jinx of hilarious hillbillies; They were the wacky hi-jinx of hilarious hillbillies who had famous country music stars as friends. In other words, fragile intrigues and declining movie stars were just an excuse to present a large number of country music stars of the time. Many of the performances were synchronized, although some were recorded live. The Nashville Sound, recorded in 1969, was different. Perhaps influenced by the Pennebaker documentaries of the time, this film has no fragile plot or funny gags. Instead, it was a serious look at Nashville and the country's stars. It's well filmed, meticulous and fascinating to watch. Much of it was filmed at the Grand Ole Opry, but you also have priceless images like Loretta Lynn performing in front of a group of radio and record labels, Bashful Brother Oswald singing a Mountain Dew chorus in front of the Record Shop. Ernest Tubb. , a rehearsal of Mother Earth (with Tracy Nelson), a performance outside Shelby Singleton 's house, a recording session with Doug Kershaw and a hairless Charlie Daniels, and many more. There are also many beautiful pictures of Nashville itself. All the performances are exceptional and the film does a great job capturing the essence of country music at the time: performers, fans and people from the industry. I waited a long time for it to come out on DVD!""",1

"b""Action movies remind me of the true beauty of movies, how a story can be told through a visual arrangement and a movement through the frame, instead of a dead dialogue and two still actors who converse. These films are like filmed plays, while others are inspired by black and black white roots, telling stories without words. Road Warrior contains one of the finest examples of this genre - such a small moment, a minor hurdle overcome, but which dances boldly across the screen like a painter. Here's the magic, shot by shot. Midway through the final chase sequence, a red hot rod approaches Max's big truck behind with intent to kill him. In a shot that has been copied several times, Max gets out of the cabin and pushes his shotgun into the camera - a forced perspective, moving right and left, zigzagging back onto the screen. The wicked's head explodes like a firecracker, and we are treated with a shout of joy by Max's wolf's wild friend - an animal reaction to the violence ironically given by a child raised by animals. clippings that tell the little story of the red car losing control and hitting other nasty vehicles. This little story is closed by the famous and almost peaceful shot of a man who jumps his head in a horizontal fall, still in forced perspective and flying to the camera. Now another series of jumps takes us back to the red hot rod and we are fighting to stay out of Max's huge wheels. In a beautiful game of movement, the car dances in front of Max's truck, making trips back and forth to Max and our screens like a carrot, until we have a third shot in forced perspective: the camera approaches the The truck grills, then climbs up and enters the cabin to Max, when Max finally puts an end to the misery of this car by nailing it into an explosion of pieces of gasoline and metal. A beauty so sick and twisted ... Did you know that George Miller, the director of Road Warrior, also directed Babe?""",1
"b'Ruff Ryders have become legends of the street in many ways in Hip Hop culture and they have set a standard of quality in delivering a product often brutal and without difficulty in the hardcore levels.

"b""I had this film on a whim, partly because I'm tired of seeing Americans turn into big drops or pussies who are afraid of their own shadow comparison, but this is a collage that goes well to The Karate Kid and Secondhand Lions (New Line Platinum Series). It is certainly up to the challenge with Million Dollar Baby (full screen edition) and Absolute Power. summarize this film so I will say only three things: 1. It weaves with as much grace as possible all that the American man has done himself. and Prejudice did for India but without music, love and dance.3 The ending is spectacular - Eastwood's voice in the background, slowly singing against a visual as the Gran Torino moves towards future with his special passenger master For this alone I would rent or buy the DVD.""",1

The film is essentially a documentary about the members of this group and some of their training sessions in different places. it's well set up and I like music. there is a lot of content on the DVD, so there will be a lot of things to take. There are many good ideas on how to train and unorthodox workouts that teachers pass through to students. So, for this aspect, you could not ask for more. The only complaint I would make is that it's not a step-by-step presentation on training. there is no progression from this skill to another. I really thought I was buying something more like this. so in that sense, I was a little disappointed. there is a video produced by american parkour which is specifically intended for the initiation to the formation of parkour. I will probably receive this one too.

"b'Me too, I really like the original theatrical release and I bought the 2-disc edition for quite some time. I generally have an aversion to Hollywood\'s marketing ploys, but from what I heard from Mark Steven Johnson about his comment from the previous version, they were really on time during production, especially with some CG stuff. They also struggled a lot with the MPAA to keep their PG-13 rating. (It\'s hard to be faithful to the darkness in the comic book series while marketing it for optimal revenue.) Let\'s hope they have taken the time to sensually incorporate the extra fighting images into the story and few painful shots (in the middle of many good ones). Aside from marketing ploys, I think there is extra pressure for administrators these days to ""get the product out"", that they have to make various artistic compromises (and, the LOTR). I really hope this DVD was designed for Johnson to ""complete his original vision"" for an already good movie!'",1

"b'& quot; The Breakfast Club & quot; is the film on the brat pack that I allow myself to guess and which will be remembered for a long time as a turning point in American cinema - at least as far as comedy for teenagers is concerned. The plot (for those who do not know him already) is articulated around 5 teenagers from different horizons, forced to sit together during a relaxation session on Saturday afternoon. A hilarious, well-crafted and often poignant film about the fundamental truths that make us all human, John Hughes & quot; The Breakfast Club & quot; is perhaps the greatest exploration of the anguish and confusion that has afflicted all of us during the high school years. Although anamorphically improved for 16X9 screens, this newly created DVD offers no improvement in video compared to the previously released DVD. The colors are dated, unrealistic, often unbalanced with bleeding and burrs. The details are minimal, even in well-lit scenes. The contrast, shadow, and black levels are all extremely low. Age-related artifacts, including chips, scratches and spice cuts are all obvious. A considerable amount of film grain is present everywhere for a totally unsatisfactory visual presentation. The 5.1 audio in Dolby and DTS features a dated feature with a muted dialogue and virtually no spatial separation, except in the music tracks. The Breakfast Club & quot; is a brilliant film However, the lack of extras (a documentary would have been nice) and the very low processing of the transfer led me to say that this record was not worth it.'",0
"b""It only takes a few minutes to see how terrible this thing is. The film begins with jets involved in a high-speed, transcontinental race. Well, our hero pilot Grant (Antonio Sabato Jr.) decides he needs to be refueled. Have you ever seen a crew refuel a car on the track during a NASCAR race? No, me neither. It would be a little dangerous, I guess. Well, Grant's jet is refueled by another plane while it is in the direct flight path of the other race planes. What happens ? Duh ... there is a horrible collision and three drivers (with 11 spectators ... huh?) Are dead. Good move guys. Maybe the funniest and most pathetic event of the movie happens a little later. Several years have passed since the tragic incident of the jet race and we are listening to a person in charge of the network who broadcast the race live. The executive says ... are you ready? ... he says that the sequence of jets colliding during the race was the highest-rated video they had shown in the last four years. Unbelievable! ! Talk about a future world where nothing exciting happens. Must be boring. Other things to look for are a guy who makes noise when his mouth does not move. In addition, a scene where a shirtless Sabato Jr. is about to wear a tank top. He takes it but the camera changes angle and now there is nothing to see. Then the camera changes angle again and pulls it on his head. Good editing! In this film, everything is cheap, except for decent actors.

"b""Bloodrayne (Uwe Boll, 2005) From time to time, you meet a really bad movie director, but every time he undertakes a project, he does something, even if you know that the movie will be even worse than the last piece shit he has released, it always makes you want to see it.In this case, Uwe Boll, responsible for such execrable films as Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead, managed to sneak into a casting is hard to believe were willing to take a chance on a movie based on the video game Uwe Boll. At the top of the list of `` what were they thinking? The actors here are Ben Kingsley. Can you believe this guy played Gandhi? Michael Madsen (Reservoir Dogs), Billy Zane (Posse), Michelle Rodriguez (Girlfight), Udo Kier (Suspiria) and many others are also present. I can not believe they were all short of money. All are presented under television actress Kristianna Loken (who saw the big screen playing the bad boss in Terminator 3), in the title role of the film, a half-human half-vampire who wants to kill Kingsley. The character of Kagan, because Kagan killed Rayne's mother. The fact that he is also his father does not seem to make him doubt his motivation. Not that anyone in this movie has enough character to really have a lot of motivation. That does not seem to bother Boll, who cuts this film exactly the same fabric as his colleagues: a lot of action, sex notes that could actually be interesting if he cared enough to explore these scenes, a useless script, a camera that is right on this side of the skill, and Boll's somewhat impressive ability to do the worst possible of anyone. And yet, despite everything The most depressing thing about Bloodrayne is that the film has gone quite well overseas (predictably, it has had a nightmare in America, making two and a half million, less than one fifth of the budget). At least none of the original actors, including Loken, had the courage to sign for what can not help but be another Boll monstrosity. (zero)""",0
"b'We spend half of our time on Lake Como, so I think this DVD would be great. I wish other reviews were available before buying the DVD.

As I watched the comment (yes, I'm a monster watching these videos), all I could think was that this movie would not be so bad if there was no sound.

Otherwise, skip it and find Michelle on Lost reruns or Turner on the L-Word.""",0
"b'This film almost reminds me of the television series Alice: in a small restaurant run by a grouchy little chef with a golden heart, and led by a trio of waitresses, the brave Blondie Southern, the childish and naive, and the single mother who has the means (or the expectant mother, in this case), as well as the typical assortment of wacky and colorful customers. The writer / director Adrienne Shelly manages to take this model and to draw something marvelous. Far from being a simple remake of Alice, Waitress is a well designed and well - executed exploration of a woman \'s fight to take her place and make her dreams come true, despite the bad choices and bad decisions she made on the run. of road. what really sets it apart from the rest of the big screen is the script. The dialogue, written by Adrienne Shelly - who also directed and co-starred Dawn, the smiling waitress who ultimately finds true love - sparkles with wit, charm and humor. It\'s fast and it\'s funny, but it always seems quite natural, thanks in no small part to the talents of the actors and the actresses responsible for broadcasting it. Unlike the writing, say, of Gilmore Girls, widely appreciated for its uniqueness, the dialogue in Waitress never seems forced or unnatural. It\'s great without being intrusive. My only reduction to this movie is the fact that the message ""men are dogs"" is a bit heavy. Without exception, all waitress\'s male characters are portrayed as being either naughty, like Earl (Jeremy Sisto), unprincipled, like Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion), or just weird, like Ogie (Eddie Jemison). Even Joe (Andy Griffith), who is really kind and caring, shows up throughout the aggressive and demanding film, so much so that Jenna, who has been suffering for a long time, is the only person able to deal with him and his only friend . This is obviously a film made by a woman, mainly for a female audience, but we can not help thinking that if a man made a movie in which all the female characters were nothing else, would be a game serious, well deserved. Waitress is a good movie that is worth the detour. It is tragic that Shelly, who was brutally murdered in November 2006, is no longer making films, as this film will undoubtedly raise the impressive talents of the author / director to a wider audience than ever before. . Fortunately, Waitress is an appropriate memorial to remember.'",1

"b'The cultural revolution that shook Paris from 1905 to 1930 is well documented in this two-hour documentary DVD, which includes photographs, film archives, literary excerpts and analyzes. The focus is on the arts, from classical music and jazz to sculpture, from poetry to dance, to paintings painted in novels. The rise of post-Impressionist modernism to Fauvism, Cubism, Dada and Surrealism and their many pioneers of the fine arts and literature is considered an extraordinary period of free experimentation and interdisciplinary interaction, especially between poets and artists. Paris was the pot of fermentation and the vanguard was strong, strong and varied. Watching this documentary can inspire envy. O have lived in such a time! Of course, my generation and I experienced such a revolution, albeit for a shorter time in this fast-growing society, while San Francisco Bay, between 1965 and 1980, was the hub of musical, artistic, and noetic innovation. , ecological and scientific. and explorations. Which evokes a minor gap in the documentary: the absence of any mention of developments in science, especially physics, and its influence on the arts, when the concepts of time and space and matter have made the object of a radically new reflection. Otherwise, the survey is a wonderful cultural story, optimism before the First World War and the engine of cynicism and creative criticism after the carnage. The viewer can then immerse himself in the many books covering this exciting period to continue his studies. This DVD is an excellent introduction to the history of art and cultural studies.'",1
"b""We should all congratulate Uwe Boll. He's like a kind of cinematic roach. No matter how little talent he has, and no matter how bad these films are, he manages to make them. I know, he finances them himself through some kind of bizarre German fund, but still, his ability to continue making movies despite absolute and complete failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe. that video game developers continue to give their best properties to this guy. I really enjoyed the Alone in the Dark series of games. Even the last one, the New Nightmare, was good for a few hours of play. There was a good movie to make Edward Carnby's adventures, but that's not it. Now, Uwe Boll has got hold of Bloodrayne and Hunter: The Reckoning. What's next, Silent Hill? Doom? I can only imagine the band that this guy will cut through movie game adaptations if he is not stopped. Someone has to withdraw their line of credit, or these video game publishers have to realize and realize that when they make a bad movie in a game that kills the franchise, no one is interested in that title. Is House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark a viable game title? No way . A new House of the Dead game is coming out for XBox and nobody cares. The title is dead, and all because of Uwe Boll. So, if one of you works for a game publisher, or knows a game publisher, or has access to a game publisher ... please let them know. This movie itself is not even worth reading. I can not separate what I did not like from this pile of dung from the rest. Literally, everything is zero. Writing, playing, music, synthesis effects, editing. I thought that if I waited for the release on DVD and that I rent it with few expectations, I would not be disappointed. Even the 5 dollars you will spend on this DVD if you buy them on one of Amazon's sellers is too much. You are going to regret it . This movie is just a bunch of Boll.""",0

He enters Grant's life and upsets everything and both learn to be men. Instead of turning to comedy, the scenario is more subtle, focusing on the dilemmas, contradictions, hypocrisies and even humor in their tragic failures. It's really a drama that takes everything seriously.

Anyone who has always wanted to get ahead, but who has been the victim of class snobbery and arrogance in the workplace will be linked to this movie.

However, he keeps his cool, even if he discovers that the couple who hired him is stabbing in the back. Just see the movie to find out, no?).

"b'This musical continues to delight and seduce us ... more than 40 years after its creation. This is worth our old fashioned applause - with a good show of songs and solid dances. Robert Preston shines like Professor Harold Hill ... an unscrupulous crook who tries to deceive the entire population (about 2,400) of River City, Iowa. He makes his way through their hearts (and their wallets) and manages to stay one step ahead of the authorities. Along the way, he (Professor Hill) touches the life of a future woman (Shirley Jones as Librarian Marian) and her extremely shy little brother Winthrop (played by a very young and adorable Ronnie Howard) and, to his surprise, he finds himself in the unfamiliar territory of a good friend. His planned escape has been blocked, he is caught and must, uh, face the music. Throughout this journey, we receive many memorable and fun songs and delicious dance routines. The filmmakers showed a little courage ... using a little imagination and taking risks ... and gave us a lot of entertainment. My favorite places are the opening sequence of the train and the excellent dance (and song) scene inside the library. The people of River City are stubborn and narrow-minded ... but in fact they are comedy producers. Virtually all the adult characters in the film contribute their share of the workload ... and add humor to the pleasure of the image. Paul Ford, like Mayor George Shinn, is particularly talented ... and Hermione Gingold, who plays his wife Eulalie, is funny too (albeit in a different way). Shirley Jones is pretty good here. She has always been a great singer, but she also plays stage and fantasy. Pert Kelton, as an Irish mother, is a delight. But the show belongs to Robert Preston. A very talented artist, he is light and agile (and agile) by manipulating his lines. He is not a great singer ... he speaks most of the lyrics of his songs ... but they (the songs) work, and they work well. I had heard that in the pre-production phase of the film, they wanted to replace Robert Preston (the star of the stage version of ""The Music Man"") with someone else. Meredith Willson, the author of the original story, gave them an ultimatum ... either Robert Preston remains or ... no movie. And by watching it (Preston) happen here, it\'s easy to understand that feeling. It\'s a delight.'",1
"b'This Is It shows that until the end, the king of pop possessed all the elements that made him a superstar. Here we see the preparation for his unfortunate London Comeback, but even though we all know how this story ends, you can not help but smile when you see Michael in his original element and have fun. The most intriguing part of this documentary is the lack of dialogue with Michael Jackson, but you can feel totally in his expressions the cogs that work actively inside; He strove hard in this last effort to make the world vibrate. It\'s Michael Jackson, unlike what he\'s been seeing for years. Here, he sings all his songs live, even those who have a fast past such as Jam, They Do not About Us and Smooth Criminal - this item also shows fans how exhausting it really was to dance and sing, and this sequence clearly shows why, for the Dangerous and History tours, he had to synchronize several faster numbers. Many of the signature MJ dance moves have been omitted, and I would have liked to see some images without occasional distractions of the 3D short films (I wish they had put it on a split screen so we could see this sequence AND the performance of the scene at the same time). The performances of the rehearsal are clearly the following: I can not stop loving, I will be there Thriller (totally new production that used in the Dangerous and History tours!) Beat It (the first time in years, I have I saw the same dance in 1982!) The others are good too, but none are close as sharp or polite as these figures of the repetition. The key point of this rehearsal sequence is to be able to hear her sing live, and it would have been better if this Is It album contains these versions instead of the studio versions ... Moreover, the new guitarist of Michael is great (on the eyes and on the ears). Many of MJ\'s dance moves are omitted, and I would have liked to see some rehearsal footage without the occasional distraction of 3D shorts (I wish they were split) screen so we could see this footage AND the performance of the scene at the same time). So, in all fairness, this is not at all an experience in concert with MJ, but it has all the elements of one. The slogan of ""Get to know the man you have never known"" is not really accurate because Very few dialogues with Michael Jackson apart from seeing him say ""God bless you"" to all the members of the production team and noting when it thinks something needs to be changed about how something is done. It will be remembered as the greatest concert ever to take place in the history of music. From these few vague excerpts of what This Is It\'s current concert may reveal, Michael would have made a comeback in this series of concerts, and once again, he proved that he was and will always remain king of pop. It is recalled that even though the tabloids tried to throw it into the light of evil, the only message from Michael Jackson was that of love. LOVE. simple and simple.'",1

Then he is on the ground using these principles in action. It\'s in the first DVD that Manny also explains parallel thinking. Parallel thinking is ""how can I photograph this scene""? Do not just take the picture you originally saw. Instead, what other options (different times of the day, different seasons, use of different lenses, etc.) can you use to capture scenes in one place? The second DVD features 14 field sessions at different locations on the east coast. During each session, Manny offers a detailed description of what he does at each location, and explains why. Throughout these sessions you will find information that you might miss, but that is important. For example, if you stack filters on a lens, use a ring lift so you can use larger filters on a lens and not burn your photo. Or, do not change lenses at the beach if the wind is blowing, because you do not want to introduce grains of sand into a lens or into the camera; and when you return home, vacuum the lens and the camera to remove the grains of sand on the outside surfaces.

Second, the digital transfer is AWFUL! if I did not know better, they copied the VHS master to DVD. the colors are all blah and the animation is lost. This mystifies me because I also have the German widescreen version (which is amazing!) And their transfer is impeccable and clean! third, did anyone forget the special functions of this disc? ! Play the movie or the selection of scenes. that's it ! . Finally, this movie has the worst art box ever! and it does not stop there art is also on the record and the interactive menus (which play a hideous god made for dvd elevator music!) This release of an amazing movie is a crime! Craftsman (the company) should really rethink that and publish a new special transfer edition. but that will never happen.""",0
"b""I went into this film trying to have an open mind, considering that I had heard, at best, mixed things about it. But in the first 15 minutes, I knew it was a mistake to give it a shot. It looks like a video clunker, and that's basically what it is. the plot is simple. A man who goes down a lonely highway at night. There is a love triangle that has gone wrong and a lot of speculation about what is in the chest and why it is there. But frankly, I did not care. The acting is horrible and the writing is laughable. So, believe me ... do not bother with this one.""",0

All the qualities of the 2002 version are insufficient. The characters are merged. Families obliterated. George Cloony may be a beautiful face, but any demanding character is out of him. Solaris is far from stealing a project for him. He needs much more obvious formula roles to really shine.'",0

"b'This movie was not great at all! He did not follow the book for a second! I thought this movie would run like the book I read in high school, but it succumbed! It was as if they did not care enough about the central points that made the book work in the first place. I think the movie tore me up because the characters did not connect to the book at all! First, there is Agnes Bruckner, who played Vivian. It did not look anything like the book\'s ""Vivian"", his diary and motivation were not the same, his personality was completely different from the book\'s, his performance in the film was mediocre in the sense that Agnes was not not at all the character of the time. The script was very old and terrible! My imagination desired more drama and precision. The red-haired woman playing Esme played down the character (for whom was the most important villager in the book). Everyone plays in this film was too flat in general! Whatever you do, avoid this movie like the plague! This movie was not even scary or clever. For those of you who have loved the book, do not worry about the movie because it is a DEAD END!'",0
"b'This particular crime series is above the panoply of whodunnits. There is only another series of detectives in his class that comes to mind - and this is the Sherlock Holmes series that featured the wonderful Jeremy Brett. There is something very interesting in the relationship between Lynley and Havers. It\'s still strictly platonic and professional, and yet it\'s something more ... a friendship. I refer affectionately to Havers as Lynleys\' ""spouse of work"". Those familiar with the series and newcomers will find that to some extent this is true. Aside from friendship, there is a lot of detective work in this series. I appreciate the brainstorming sessions of Lynley and Havers and even their arguments, which can be scathing. I must mention a word about the actor Sharon Small. It must be said that Ms. Small fits so easily in the role of Havers, it\'s almost incredible. All in all, this is a high-quality and entertaining crime series that only appears once in a while.'",1
"b'Former government agent Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) must solve the mystery of the events that took place as a child to save the planet from destruction by monsters from another dimension.OK, I admit, ""Alone in the dark"" does not appear on my best movies of all time, but it\'s not my worst movie list either. It can be directed by Uwe Boll, considered by many to be the worst director of all time, but if all the other Boll films are like that, then Boll was grossly underrated because I saw a lot of movies that are much worse than this one (for example, the remake of ""The Stepford Wives""). The script is based on a video game, which gives it the ""video game"", going from level to level, getting with a lot of movies of this type (such as ""Resident Evil"" or ""Doom""), but that does not did not put out of the movie like making me want to play and play the game. Not being a player, it was my first encounter with ""Alone in the Dark"" and I found the story interesting enough to maintain my interest in the movie. The game is of unequal quality. Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff (as other government agent) both offer decent performances, but Tara Reid is not convincing as a scientist, which adds to the entertainment value of the film. My main criticism is that some of the battle scenes are too long. There is a fight scene at about 1 hour that includes about 15 minutes of people shooting at monsters with very little dialogue, which has become tedious after a while. Despite that, I have always loved the film and I would be ready to see it again.'",0

"b'This is a masterpiece of a film inspired by John Landis, who takes a topic many times before - lycanthropy - and adds some sauce and spices to the kettle. Here we have a movie of werewolves with adventure, a black comedy, a little flesh (both rushed and torn in bloody rags), laughter, ""oh-my-gods"" and even a pathetic. It\'s a brilliant, inventive and inventive film with great special effects that you\'ll never forget, as I did not see it on the screen in \'81. Night begins with two young Americans crossing the scary European countryside . I love the scene where they enter a pub and are welcomed like the plague. The two leave the place and are quickly invaded by a werewolf with a guy mutilated to death, and the other, the ""he-hada-gone places"" David Naughton [who plays David] surviving to become a wolf - Murderous assassin. All hell breaks loose afterwards, as David falls in love during the day, kills at night and constantly strikes his backpacker, Jack, with his torn and torn flesh. With loud cries and laughter, as with each of Jack\'s post-mortem appearances, he deteriorates more and more until, in the end, he is nothing but skull and fascia. The scene in the theater when Jack presents David to each of his dead victims devoured, with gaping holes and missing limbs, is a beauty. The transformation scene where David turns into a werewolf in his living room is absolutely incredible and unforgettable - it\'s a classic horror scene. Long live the special effects and makeup professionals here. A superb rendition of John Landis with a refreshing originality and a wonderful and clever variation on a stereotypical horror theme. Sorry, Naughton did not become the star he should have. If you have not seen this one, you must do it before the next full moon. Lon Chaney Jr would have been proud of these guys.'",1

"b""We acquired this collection because we wanted to own the 1935 version of A Tale of Two Cities. We just watched it and had a wonderful experience. The film is very close to the plot, the performances are superb. The book of Charles Dickens will forever be a testimony to the struggle of humanity between the naked and the others. The performance of Blanche Yurka, as Madame DeFarge, is remarkable. French citizens, seeking to put an end to the tyranny they endure on the part of the oppressive aristocracy, present the endless example that, when rights are exceeded, they always lead to revolution and change. Marquis St. Evremonde, played by Basil Rathbone, shows the horror he represents for everyone to show that they do not care about those who suffer. Especially when it comes to children; because the horror committed against this family provokes the fire that leads to events that put an end to the ruling society. Manette's performance as an innocent prisoner at the Bastille for more than 18 years is superb. His daughter, played by Elizabeth Allen, represents the person who inspires a great love to two men, Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton, superbly portrayed by Ronald Colman. The character of Miss Pross, played by Edna May Oliver, is awesome. We will hate her, admire her, and then love her for her sacrifice that saves Mrs. Manette's life. In the end, the sacrifice made by Sydney for Lucie's sake is one of the most sensitive and touching love stories. He finds a purpose for his life, knowing very well that his actions will live forever in the hearts of those for whom he sacrifices. I highly recommend owning this DVD. The other films have to be reviewed as we see them.""",1

Casting and acting are both impeccable and the chemistry between the two talented leaders is wonderful, but I still found that looking at it was somewhat empty and depressing.

It looks like quatlity from the outside and says it has been remastered and that format is a mailbox. Not true . This is a poor form of video transfer and is cropped, not even close to the mailbox and the sound is poorly mastered. Even the menu deceives the words.

"b""This fun and fun puzzle game has an incomparable reach and flavor, making it 88 minutes entertaining at the movies. William A.

Claire Trevor is the coach of the cops L.A. Madeline Haley, ex-O.S.S. Officer who is poking his way into the mission to go south to try to get information on the mean middleman Pete Ritche, hoping that it will lead them to Mr. Big.

He ends up taking Madeline with him after the weapons are fired and the pursuit is launched. Madeline and Johnny tell each other stories and warm each other up. When Johnny's mate, Miguel, gets shot, they have a body to handle, which further complicates the pursuit. Fred MacMurray is good like Johnny, the cop who does not know Madeline is a cop, who does not know he's a cop! Trevor is a kind of fun pulp movie with more flavor than a habanero pepper, and she's starting to like Johnny. Without knowing it, he helps them to catch a plane for Encinada for the big problem. Like the two near the border, everyone regrets having to return the other because they fell on top of each other. ending at this very fun to watch the movie.

Then I watched the director's commentary. It took at least 15 minutes of the movie. Most filmmakers add to their film when given the chance and do not remove it. The director's son created a fragmented and disjointed film, very different from his original mood and plot. After waiting years for Erik the Viking's DVD, I was extremely disappointed and a little angry at the way which they treated. I hope to see the theatrical release available in the near future, because I do not think I will look again at the sound of this director, and I certainly will not share this version of the film with friends and family as I had originally planned.""",0
"b'If you have not read the book yet, you miss a lot of essential information to understand what is happening in the film. On the other hand, the movie has more action and endless twists than the movie, and the movie tends to be confusing without reading. I have some objections to the movie. in the book, the script of the film has some differences with the original novel by Dan Brown: - At the beginning of the film, you find Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) signing his book in an event in Paris, while in the novel the book was published again. As part of this scene, the French police came to get him to this event to go to the Louvre, while in the novel, it was very late and slept in the hotel. the book, and was oversimplified in the film.- The alleged conspiracy between the Vatican and Opus Dei has some twists in the book, and has totally changed in the film. The relationship between the Vatican and the Opus Dei group is described in more detail. There is a lot of information missing about Silas, the albino monk. Getting the security box from the Swiss bank was much more interesting in the book. was an additional Criptek in the book.- There are other crucial differences towards the middle and the end of the film, but I do not want to mention then, because if you have not read the book or seem the movie I will ruin the suspense for you.Finally, read the book, watch the movie, do not listen to critics, ... WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS WHAT YOU BELIEVE. Use your common sense and reasoning abilities.4 stars for the movie, 50 stars for the book.'",1

I was more than fair. Unless you are interested in a harvest so terrible that it makes you laugh, DO NOT BUY THIS FILM! It\'s a total disaster! Movie Rayne has nothing to do with his video game counterpart. The fighting scenes were slow, nothing to do with the fluidity of the game. And do not get me into trouble ... I saw better setups in a haunted house. Nothing has been done realistically, and the ten minute recap at the end of the film (which was done for a reason that I will never understand) only shows how negligible it is. The game was not great either, and the brief sex scene ... let\'s just say that I found myself laughing through most of this mess. Needless to say, the plot was also missing (and it is lightly).

If you do not like ""boys"" as a dubbed Japanese movie, it will drive you crazy. The quality of the image is also very bad. I have a VHS copy of ""Flying Deuces"" that looks better than that.

The film is not only bad, it is sometimes boring, only stimulated by the fun of horribly done script lines and meaningless action. Above all, this film incriminates its director.

Even then, that might not be enough. The good news is to use his films as a means of torture for terrorists. Someone suggested that the only thing Boll should direct is a porn movie. I do not agree . I'm sure he'll find a way to ruin it too. He would probably focus on the man's limb instead of the woman's. No, the only thing Boll should lead should be the end of his career. What is incredibly entertaining about this movie is the reviews of this site and reviews of the Rottentomatoes. Reading them, I burst out laughing for several minutes. The comment of a previous critic on how the prostitutes of the film were real Romanian prostitutes is a riot. I will not even dive into the plot because it is inconsequential so for all those who have not watched the movie yet, indulge yourself and read the reviews.

"b'A Faustian spin through New York and post-war Louisiana, ""Angel Heart"" tells a very old story from a surprisingly original and wonderfully frightening angle. The plot, which focuses on the case of a missing person more and more violent, is relatively simple, but the story that triggers it is remarkably complex. When you collect the pieces at the end, it makes sense, but right. De Niro is superb like Louis Cyphre, the ""shopkeeper"" with some guarantees to collect, infusing the right balance between sardonic humor and demonic threat. Mickey Rourke gives what will probably still be his best performance as Harry Angel, a shocked war veteran and a disjointed P.I. The support cast is excellent, especially Charlotte Rampling as a occultist, and Lisa Bonet as a voodoo witch. But the real star is the writer / director Alan Parker. He has an extraordinary talent for the simple but powerfully disturbing image: a slow zoom on the exterior wall of a New York hotel; a New Year\'s crowd in Times Square; a descending elevator; a wide staircase; the blades rotating a fan. These images are simple, cold, but overflowing with hellish threats. Trevor Jones\' music is the perfect accompaniment, his saxophones exuding threatening rhythms and the omnipresent pulsation of a beating heart. It is a deeply disturbing marriage that will be afraid to close around you with the same uncertainty as the fate of the protagonist.'",1

Anyway, I rarely write more than 3 or 4 line reviews, but this is an example. of these rare exceptions. I watched this film for the second time a few days ago and, curiously, the impact was even greater than the first time. He keeps playing in my head all day. Some details that had escaped, I noticed now. Despite what some people may say, I can not think of anything more beautiful and purer than the love the boy visibly felt for his soldier. By reading some of the comments, I tend to agree with many of them. They say they have become extremely sad. One woman said that she wanted to get the boy in and tell him that his prince would come back. Another guy said he wondered if the soldier really knew how much the child loved him. Rudi Van Danzig died in January of this year and someone said that he would finally meet his soldier. Well, I could not read it, but judging by the movie, it's hard to imagine anyone who would not want to live a story as intense, though short, and whatever. always remain a mystery, and this, in my opinion, adds to the magic. I will not repeat here what has been said about the actors. They are really good. However, a particular observation about the boy and the soldier: they are really convincing and sometimes you even feel like enjoying them. The boy has the kind of unusual and fleeting beauty you see once in your life. His eyes are sad, even when he smiles. Of course, there will always be those who are ready to criticize it, but it is to be expected. Let's face it: some things are not meant for everyone. Technically speaking, my only complaint is that, unfortunately, the quality of the picture is not great, but the movie itself more than makes up for it. And I will watch it again! ! !""",1
"b""It's hard to find words to start describing this fantastic show. First of all, the writing is superb. Some elements of this story lead the viewer to go online or visit the local library for more information on what is being presented. There is a richness in storytelling that is not often seen on television today. For all that we are told, there are nearly twenty things that we are not told ... which really involves the viewer in the series. It encourages active visualization, speculation, discussion and research, among others. This does not mean that one could not simply watch the show and derive a supreme level of pleasure. The first season, I was an almost-active spectator and I always thought it was the best show I've ever seen. The images created by the dialogue are incomprehensible. And of course, what is the good writing without great talent to deliver the lines? In the foreground, there are powerful actors such as Clancy Brown as Brother Justin in conflict and Nick Stahl as Ben Hawkins, intrepid but discreet. Seeing seemingly unrelated stories between these two evolving characters is an incredible event. The show also includes Tim DeKay, Clea Duvall, Cynthia Ettinger, Amy Madigan, Michael J. Anderson, Toby Huss, Brian Turk, Adrienne Barbeau, John Savage and even Pa Walton himself, Ralph Waite. If one is a fan of any of these actors, their talents are highlighted in this series. The emotions go through the first season and these actors know exactly how to represent them. And what is good writing and a beautiful action without a spectacular return for the action to take place? From the windy sandstorms of Dustbowl Oklahoma to the beautiful countryside of rural California, every set is perfect. The eyes receive beautiful images to absorb. Last but not least, the mere involvement of the store alone. As I mentioned earlier, this show makes you an active spectator. If you've ever, for a moment, believed in the era of wonder ... the magic of the past ... this series is definitely worth it. Elements of our daily life are challenged and an entirely new world is created before your eyes. I challenge everyone who buys the DVDs of the first season to watch only one episode at a time. Look at one and wait a week before seeing another one. I bet you can not. You will be impatient to see what happens next. If you did not think it was possible with a TV show, remember ... it's not TV ... it's HBO.""",1

"b'I must confess with some shame that before this movie, I did not know who Harvey Pekar was. But that did not limit my ability to enjoy this movie, which was one of the most interesting I\'ve seen in a long time. The theme of the film as a whole is brilliantly summarized in the first seconds of the film. Several boys climb into a house on Halloween, all dressed up as superheroes, except for one boy, who is simply dressed as himself: Harvey Pekar. The film as a whole is about Pekar\'s attempt to tell his mundane, boring, and disappointing life in a comic book. Instead of a comic book about superheroes, he devised a cartoon about himself, a clerk at the Veterans Hospital in Cleveland. The film tells the story of Pekar\'s life in more or less detail, highlighting his encounter with R. Crumb in the 1960s and his inspiration in the drawing of a comic, despite his inability to draw. By taking incidents of his own life, involving his friends and colleagues, designing comic book frames and engaging artists to illustrate his stories (many by Crumb himself), Pekar manages to create something unique , funny and strange way, triumphant and beautiful. The film implies that we can all be the heroes of our own story. There is not much going on in the film, but it still manages to compete. The major events of the story are Pekar\'s meeting with R. Crumb, his decision to write his own comic book, to meet his wife, a series of performances in the late 1980s on the Dave Letterman Show and his cancer. Throughout, there is no attempt to make Pekar better than him. He is portrayed as physically unattractive, a little weird, a chronic underachiever, more than a little neurotic and extremely self-absorbed. But in spite of all that, there is an honesty to look at her life and describe her as she is, warts and everything. The way he treats everything with an indefatigable sense of humor and his determination to make his life an objective and a goal is heroic in a very concrete way, as opposed to the fictitious heroism of Superman, Batman, or the Green Lantern.It would be difficult to impress Paul Giamatti too much by playing Harvey Pekar or Hope Davis while playing Joyce Brabner, the woman who marries Pekar. The real Pekar and the real Brabner also appear on the camera, as are most of the real models of the Pekar characters. In fact, the way the story of the film circulates transparently between real people, actors and comics is one of the highlights of the film. In a scene, the Paul Giamatti playing Pekar and Judah Friedlander playing with Pekar\'s friend (and MTV celebrity) Toby Radloff are on the screen while the real ones Harvey Pekar and Toby Radloff have a conversation. In another part of the film, Hope Davis and Paul Giamatti are supposed to be behind the scenes of the show Dave Letterman, but when Giamatti, as Pekar, comes out on stage with Letterman, he cuts the images of the real Pekar interviewed by Letterman . I remembered Margritte\'s famous painting, where he painted a pipe with the words ""This is not a pipe"" underneath. By switching from real Pekar to an actor who plays it, it\'s a way of saying, ""It\'s not Harvey Pekar"" whenever Giamatti is on the screen. In addition, it is clear that Giamatti is the cinematic equivalent of the different Pekars drawn in comics. It\'s a great movie, and I hope it gets the attention it deserves. It\'s very different from the CRUMB movie, but I guess it will appeal particularly to those who enjoyed this strange but fascinating documentary.'",1
"b'I\'m not going to rip Hilary Duff as a previous critic because I think it was pretty much the best part of this movie, hence the star. It\'s fun and girly but I could not appreciate it because of the constant stereotypes (ie A blonde girl enters the business world and knows nothing about how to use color the characters judge men by their ""hot abs"" or their ""tight asses."" This seems just a little sexist in terms of male and female characters and, although I know that most girls\' movies are like that in some This has never been to the point of feeling the need to go out. ""The English guy\'s accent is laughable."" Why do not they just use the English to portray the English rather than the people whose accent The other characters, besides Lane, are rather dirty and wooden, including her best friend and more or less all the people she works with .The story, I suppose, is light and cute, but if you have an ounce of telligence and do not assume that all women are bimbos whose specialized subject is the mantle and that the value of men is evaluated by the firmness of their loaves. , I suggest looking elsewhere. I was also somewhat concerned about sexual references (ie painting the bodies with chocolate and then ""burning"" after a date, talking about the climax, etc.). This is surely a bit for a younger audience?'",0
"b""I believe Waitress's excellence is unique, but my desire to help him was undoubtedly reinforced by the post-production tragedy of the murder of writer / director Adrienne Shelly. I think co-star Cheryl Hines says the best in the performance: Shelly's tragic and senseless death forces you to watch the movie through a different prism. I was surprised that Keri Russell was not nominated for the best prices. I thought she was exceptional. She is in all the scenes. His performance carries the film. It's really a series of interactions between her and her husband Earl (a wonderfully unresponsive Jeremy Sisto), she and the client / owner Old Joe (a dyspeptic Andy Griffith) and she and the doctor / suitor Dr. Pomatter. In particular, the relationship between Jenna and Russell's Nathan Fillion is very well played, both by the actors themselves and by the solid writings and direction of Shelly. She will be missed.""",1
"b""Beverly Hills Cop did not need an introduction. It was one of the best action comedies of 1984. He helped introduce Eddie Murphy into the mainstream and reigned in 1984. Beverly Hills Cop II was pretty good. A little exaggerated but still fun. It complimented Tony Scott's style and captured most of the 80s. This monstrosity is instantly forgettable from start to finish. A bust goes wrong and Inspector Todd (Gilbert R Hill) is killed. Axel (Eddie Murphy) traces the murderer known as Ellis De Wald (Timothy Carhart) to a Disney idiot named Wonderworld where Ellis De Wald is the supervisor. Where to start first? Axel Foley does not even feel like Axel Foley (much like Big Top Pee Wee was different from Pee Wee of Big Adventure). Eddie spends the whole movie looking like he does not know what his character is supposed to be. Gone is the tenacious but stupid cop who annoyed his target. He is replaced by a guy so relaxed that it becomes boring after a while. The only characters to return are Inspector Todd (but he gets killed early) and Rosewood (Judge Reinhold). Taggart is gone and Sgt too. Bogomil. This film was based on DOA. The first two films of the BHC had very good villagers considering the period. Victor Maitland and The Alphabet Killer were good villagers but Ellis De Wald is awful. Without wishing to show disrespect for Timothy Carhart, he was rather a martyr and his plan of maturity was weak and lazy in the name of the writers. Use an amusement park to make counterfeit money? The film is rarely funny and bringing back Serge (Bronson Pinochet) was an inexpensive attempt to remind us of the first interaction of Serge and Axel Foley in the first film. There is a moment of redemption in this film: the faulty sequence of driving in the park where Axel saves two children. This scene is the only reason I gave it two stars. Humor for the most part is forced and if ever hearing this annoying theme song for Wonderworld, it will be too soon. Who thought it was a fun thing? In conclusion, this film killed a promising series. It's a shame that the same director (John Landis) behind Animal House, Blues Brothers, Coming To America and a few other of my favorite movies is behind this mess. John Landis is a great director but not a great director for this type of film. Thumbs down.""",0

"b'In movies, as in most other art forms, the most important works are often presented in smaller packages. Such is the case with ""The Five Senses"", an independent Canadian production that chooses for its subject nothing less than a meditation on what it means to be human. Writer / director Jeremy Podeswa has conceived a poetic, high-profile piece centered on a group of people sharing the universal need to find true love and acceptance in a world where injured and broken relationships all too often lead to loneliness and despair. Like all of us, each of these characters seeks to achieve the twin goals of intimacy with others and self-acceptance that are essential to human happiness. Some succeed, while others fail, just as in life, but none of the characters are left untouched by experience. ""The Five Senses"", though intriguing, is more of a mood piece than a narrative drama. With an exceptional casting, Podeswa is able to attract us to the center of his world through sensory imagery and deliberate and methodical stimulation. In fact, one of the film\'s strongest themes is its examination of the role our senses play in defining our world and our character. Podeswa understands that we have become insensitive to our senses. As a result, he uses this film to reconnect with this crucial element of our beings. The silent, silent tone, the muted autumn colors, the slowly moving camera, the bewitching musical score combine to create an atmosphere in which the audience can become aware of every sight and sound that comes to us. In our effort to establish meaningful intimacy with other human beings, we most often rely on the sense of touch - but that can serve, Podeswa shows us, as much to trap us in a false intimacy as to make us one who be authentic. and sustainable. A number of his characters use sex as a substitute for true proximity, while others establish a physical connection at a much deeper level. One of the most moving moments of the film occurs when a gay man - probably an AIDS patient - falls into tears during a massage session, heartbroken because no one has dared to touch him for so long . This film recognizes the vital part played by tender physical contact in the totality of humanity. In the same way, the film explores the beauty of sound, one of the characters - ironically an ophthalmologist, a man dedicated to preserving the organ of a sense - is faced with the prospect of impending deafness and aspires to create a mental catalog of all the exquisite sounds of everyday life that he will soon be unable to hear and which we take so often for granted. Yet, like all other characters, it is his spiritual emptiness and his inability to make a meaningful connection to another human being that brings him his greatest obstacles to happiness. Podeswa also examines the smell that plays a vital role in the life of man, one of the characters - a gay and lonely man - revisits his old lovers to give them a smell of perfume to discover if he can feel true love. ""Yet, The Five Senses is not just a movie built on a clever gadget. ""On the contrary, it breathes the fullness of humanity because each of its many characters emerges as a fully developed and instantly recognizable human being. There are adolescents who are alienated by their own inability to conform to society\'s accepted norm and feel guilty by their acts of careless irresponsibility. There are mothers terrified of losing their children, in one case, literally, as their young girl moves away and disappears and, in another case, figuratively, her teenage daughter seems to sink into a ""Inexplicable strangeness. ""There are adults who can not understand a life filled with failed relationships who are desperately seeking that last chance for happiness, often with the result that they are farther away than ever from the universally desired goal. One of the most daring aspects of ""The Five Senses"" is that it does not give in to the temptation to provide a ""happy"" or even conclusive ending for all of its characters. The film recognizes that life is a disordered and endless process of change of fortune and personal growth, and that it stays true to this theme until the end. This courageous, captivating and captivating film is undoubtedly one of the true discoveries of recent films. years - a true work of art!'",1

"b'`` The Exorcist \'\', as well as movies such as `` Rosemary\'s Baby \'\', `` The Shining \'\' and `` The Ring \'\' stand out to me as some of the greatest movies of horror of all times. Not only were they good movies in themselves, but they ""broke the rules"" and adopted new ground. This DVD contains many deleted scenes and behind the scenes watching the realization of the movie.I know that I heard that after a movie screening a few months before it was released, some screen managers thought that the film should not be released. It was just too scary. When you really watch the movie for the first time, you\'ll really be scared ... Some people remember it for the ""pea soup"" incident, but this movie did not use gore to argue its point of view. Like the other movies mentioned above, he used smart imagery, dialogue, and symbols to make his points people. Most reading of this review know that the story was based on a case in 1947, in which a 13 year old boy was supposed to be possessed. Obviously, some details have been changed for the movie. I would like to see a film of the ""true"" story of 1947, in which no name is revealed, but the facts are given. The Exorcist really deserves all 5 stars. Maybe more and more writers and filmmakers should go back before trying to make another senseless teen movie that is a horror movie.'",1
"b'You\'d better eat ham if you plan on going through this movie. John Carradine, an old millionaire from Nutty, dies and states that his four children and his three servants must accomplish their inheritance through a grumpy testament in which he expresses nothing but hating everyone and saying odd things like ""It could separate the rabbits from the alley cats"" and then laughs handsomely. They have to spend a week at home or they will not be able to get their share of inheritance. Every person in the movie is totally hateful, and at the halfway point, I did not care about how the movie ended so long. After the children are settled in the house, they all begin to die in a variety of ways that are all subdued: Johnny is killed in a tank of piranhas, another is under a sheet of aluminum on a tray in the refrigerator, a couple is killed by electrocution in the bed, the other by the head, etc. . There are additional features such as Carradine that makes an adult dress up like an organ grinder monkey, a free ax to the head (one of the worst special effects of all time), voracious insects, a The film continues, and it is obvious that the conclusion will take place in the middle of the film. A special mention goes to the last line of the film addressed directly to the public: ""And I bet you thought it was the butler all the time. ""The closing music, which is at the limit of the non-listable list, is also extremely unpleasant. I gave this movie two stars (generously) for John Carradine\'s hilarious but minor performance.

And despite Penn's multiple problems with Penn's lighting supervisor, the film deserves a special place in the reduced gold list of major American artistic triumphs.""",1
"b'The Enterprise picks up several envoys from various planets to place them on a planetoid named Babel. Their plans are to discuss the acceptance of Coridan as a member of the Federation. Some members of the Federation are strongly opposed to accepting them. Reasons can range from vendettas to the desire of criminals to steal the precious Dylithium crystals on the planet - the protection of the Federation would put an end to such criminal enterprises. Among the delegates, there are Vulcans, Andorians and a foreign delegation that looks like crossings between Bassett Hounds and the Ugnaughts of `` Return of the Jedi \'\' with obsessive eyes and a short temperament. The composition of the Andorians has been remarkably successful. When Ambassador Vulcan Sarek and his wife Amanda board the Enterprise, there is obvious tension and Sarek asks that someone other than Spock be his ""tour guide"" of the ship. It is then revealed that Sarek and Amanda are Spock\'s parents. Jane Wyatt is the loveable wife and mother who has subdued much of her emotions to fit Sarek, but still allows them to emerge from time to time. Mark Lenard begins his Sarek career, which we continue to see until his death in one of the last seasons of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". Sarek has not spoken to Spock for 4 years. Angry that his son refused to study the same subjects that he and his father had studied, there are between them silences pissed off but discreet. Amanda must run to appease both of them in her own way. One of the pig-faced extraterrestrials, a gruff guy named Gaz, confronts Sarek in the living room and threatens him when Sarek declares his intention to vote for acceptance of the Coridans. Shortly after, Gas is found, murdered. An autopsy reveals that his neck was broken in a place that would cause instant death. Spock recognizes this as a form of death penalty used on Vulcan centuries earlier, preferred for its speed and painless delivery. A method called Tal-Shaya, well known to his father. An interesting element that the Romulan equivalent of the KGB is called Tal-Shayar in the Next Gen episodes - the Romulans are distant cousins \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bof the Vulcans and their languages \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bprobably have common roots ... maybe the English translation of the Tal -Shayar is: ""the neck killers""? Anyhoo, Sarek is thought to be a suspect, but he is eliminated when it is obvious that a defective heart valve prevented him from functioning. A risky operation requires that Spock, the only Vulcan on board equipped with the same rare T-negative blood type, provide close to half of his blood during a transfusion. Why they could not take a pint a day exceeds me. Spock is preparing to be the source of blood for his father when Kirk is attacked by an Andorian. The Andorian clearly stabs Kirk in the lower back, close to his loins in the attack, just before Kirk kicked him and knocked him out cold. Kirk leans on his side and pulls a bloody hand and uses the wall-mounted intercom to ask for help just before losing consciousness. In the infirmary, we see Kirk with a bandage around his naked torso. We are now told that his lung has been perforated and the Andorian has barely missed his heart. Considering he was using a small knife that could not reach his heart, I think they should have redone the fight scene, but it\'s just me. It is as if the lung injury was a reflection after the battle and perhaps the authors thought that the public would not ""find"" a kidney lesion as they would understand how a lung injury would leave him helpless. Hey, whatever. Poor continuity in these scenes, anyway. Spock suddenly refuses to participate in his father\'s surgery. Instead, he must command the Enterprise because there was a murder on board the Enterprise, an attempted murder, arguments between the delegates and an unidentified alien vessel barely pursuing them beyond the reach of their detectors and their weapons. Kirk, disoriented, wakes up in Sick Bay, he says the news and must find a way to put Spock on the operating table without violating the Federation\'s rules and the stubborn oath of Vulcan. A subsequent interrogation and search of the Andorian who attacked Kirk led to interesting discoveries that will put you on the edge of your seat. Despite some cheese here and there, this is one of the most exciting episodes of the old series. An excellent show.'",1

The film plunges even deeper, showing how funny people can be in the face of imminent destruction. The film and the book ask the question: ""What would you do if you fell asleep on a plane, but all those who were awake are dead and that one of the people on your plane is a psychopath and another is a girl blind, who can feel bad, a bit like Haley Joel Osment in ""The Sixth Sense"", then you\'re looking for shelter in an airport, but all the soft drinks are flat and the food is spoiled, then you discover that these creatures look like Pac-Man (the ""Langoliers"") literally consume the past? `` Well, what would you do? It\'s a tricky question, and to be honest with you, I do not know what I would do. But I can say one thing, Bronson Pinchot (in a performance that departs quite far from his beloved character Balki Bartokomous in the popular TV show ""Perfect Strangers"") also does not know how to answer the question. Man, is he going crazy - and I\'m not talking crazy about Riggs in ""Lethal Weapon"" - I mean, he\'s going REALLY crazy. You can say that Pinchot really accepted this role for what it was and took the method to a whole new level. After all the laughs and the routines (the scene where Dean Stockwell drinks beer at the airport is absolutely great!), You attend a fantastic and suspenseful chase scene where the Langoliers are speeding on the plane.

"b'This biopic, based on Take Me Home, an autobiography by John Denver, will be appreciated by hardcore fans (like me), but it remains horrible in many ways. The story begins in the early 1960s as John (Chad Lowe) begins his career as a folk singer. He meets Annie (Kristin Davis) at a concert and falls in love instantly. They get married and move to Aspen, but as John\'s career takes off, tension rises in the marriage. They divorce, he has a second marriage in short and discovers his love of theft, which finally earns him the respect of his father (Gerald McRaney). This film is a summary of Cliffs Notes on John\'s life; it\'s badly written and amateurish and lacks depth or emotion. Lowe (who wears a hideous clown wig that makes him look like Dana Carvey in ""Waynes World"") kills shamelessly everywhere, playing an innocent who never seems to grow up. (In fact, although the film covers thirty years, no one is getting older.) Davis is very pretty, but the horrible scenario does not give him much of a chance to develop. McRaney plays the only character that seems real, and he\'s the villain of the play. The story is shallow and Lowe\'s Denver is not particularly friendly. Her hair is so laughable and distracting that the movie has no chance. Although we hear Denver singing many of his songs, Lowe is terrible about lip sync.

"b'Wish You Were Here was the follow-up album of Pink Floyds, the very popular commercial album, Dark Side Of The Moon, which, among other great songs, contained perhaps their signature, ""Money"". Released in September 1975 Wish You Were This is the favorite album of many band members as well as fans. When he came out on the streets, he went straight to number one albums from the United States and the United States. From the first four notes - the basis of the song - he invokes a sadness, that of Syd Barrett. Recorded at London\'s Abbey Road Studios during numerous sessions. Although some of these sessions were problematic, Roger Waters\' idea was to split the ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"" centerpiece into two and join each half with three new compositions. ""Shine On"" was a tribute to Barrett, who, coincidentally, made an impromptu visit to the studio during his recording. Wish You Were This is the second Pink Floyd album written entirely by Waters. This reflects his feeling that the friendship that had united the group was largely absent. Anchored in the themes of absence, the greed of the music industry and Barrett. The album begins with a long instrumental preamble and enters the words of Shine On You Crazy Diamond, a tribute to Syd Barrett, whose mental depression forced him to leave the band several years ago. Barrett is fondly remembered with lines such as ""Remember when you were young, you shined like the sun"" and ""You have reached the secret too soon, you have cried for the moon"". This simultaneous release on Blu-Ray and The DVD is the authorized story of the album and was made with the full participation of the band members. The film is filled with new interviews with Roger Waters, David Gilmour and Nick Mason and interviews with the late Richard Wright. Cover creator Storm Thorgerson, guest singer Roy Harper and band member Ronnie Rondell and others involved in the album\'s creation are also in attendance. the decision to split ""Shine On"" became the catalyst. The interviews also shed light on the fact that before Barrett left the band, he gave up or gave up trying to make music successful. he did not want to make music for ""Top Of The Pops"" and, ironically, members of the band blamed the music industry\'s greed on themselves as the main impetuous of wanting to make music more commercially acceptable , if not exactly ""pop"" songs. The film is also full of excerpts of concerts and performances as well as pieces from the group that works on the parties.Pink Floyd: The story of Wish You Were Here is a fascinating documentary that pays tribute to the group in the creation of the masterwork album. For casual fans, collectors and musicologists, you\'ll want to add this to your collection. If you\'re an aspiring musician, then you\'ll play again and again just to get a glimpse of the creative concept. Syd Barrett has been active in music for only about seven years, recording four singles, Pink Floyd\'s first album The Piper at The Gates of Dawn (and contributing to the second), as well as several unreleased songs with Pink Floyd. In 1969, Barrett released a single single, ""Octopus"", which announced his first solo album, The Madcap Laughs (1970), recorded in one year (1968-1969) with 4 producers including David Gilmour and Roger Waters. Nearly two months after the release of Madcaps, Barrett began working on his second album, Barrett, produced by Gilmour and Richard Wright, which will be released in the late 1970s, before becoming more than thirty years old. Barrett\'s innovative guitar work and the exploration of experimental techniques such as the use of dissonance, distortion and feedback have had a huge legacy, not only in determining the direction that Floyd would take without him, but also from David Bowie to Brian Eno the influence of drawing. After suffering from diabetes for several years, Barrett died at home in Cambridge on July 7, 2006. He was 60 years old. The cause of death was pancreatic cancer. The occupation of his death certificate was given as ""retired musician. According to local newspapers, Barrett left about 1.7 million euros to his two brothers and two sisters. This amount apparently has been largely earned royalties from Pink Floyd\'s compilations and live recordings containing songs he had written with the group. The Dirty Lowdown'",1

"b'It seemed that this film was intended for this age group (13-16 years old) or the director / filmmaker from where they made this shit. The director\'s commentary changed my point of view on the first film so I thought the director\'s commentary would change his mind about it. No, no luck. The game was so bad that it made me laugh aloud. The complete madness of the ""general"" who makes himself a complete ass and says such stupid and stupid things made me say ""wow"" aloud several times. The premise of the first film was to conclude that in time of war all governments eventually turn into fascist governments. When I say ""become,"" I do not say it literally. Just that they behave and produce these results. This came directly from the director\'s mouth during his comment and that\'s what he was trying to convey. As I listened to this comment (there are two - one from the director and the other from the director / cast) I really did not have a clear picture of what they were trying to say. Of course, there was the end where the director said that the state would use religion to his advantage. If it interferes with them, they will try to eliminate it, if they think they can use it to their advantage. Regardless of these ""messages"" they were trying to convey, this was done in an amateurish and neglected way. I give science fiction a lot of leeway to suspend beliefs, but I have limits. There was something that happened to me that could happen to you too. The way these people behaved would make me believe that a very advanced technological society could in fact be extremely neglected and ineffective. Anyone who has been in our own army (like me) would have thought of a million better ways to protect the base and fight against these insects. Even with our current weapons, our own army could eliminate a volume of fire that would annihilate these insects. For a society that has been at war with these insects for the past 10 years, any government would fire the contractor or the advanced weapons division that continues to use the inefficient guns they use, despite the Marauders. The level of insubordination among these soldiers is incredible given the extreme threat and, in some cases, punishment. But I guess that\'s part of the point; that a totalitarian society could indeed produce armies with highly dysfunctional methods and leadership. These are some of the things that come to mind, although you can get this right from the first movie without wasting your time on that bad one. I thought that SST 2 was bad and I still think that one is worse than this one, but not a lot.'",0

"b'Lacombe of Louis Malle, Lucien always impresses, although he tends to have fun in the third act at the very moment when one can expect a tightening. But it remains a discreet reminder of the less heroic side of France under the reign of Vichy (the Nazis are barely seen in the film), his derisory farmboy is only accidentally collaboration with the German police composed entirely of compatriots after having been refused for resistance. The main achievement of the film is to show, like Fascism in general, the attraction of collaboration for disaffected and underperforming foreigners in the community (only one of the ""policemen"" is a true fanatic) and the attraction of the undeserved power that Lucien finds the power he has over people (especially the tacit threat of giving his Jewish ""girlfriend"" - perhaps a little more symbolically called ""France"" - to the Germans) is even more intoxicating than to kill simple animals. with Melville\'s masterpiece of resistance, The Army of Shadows, there is a banal sense of reality that accentuates the drama. Located in the kind of small picturesque village that foreigners find idyllic, but which is a tedious hell to live for the locals, it shows how much discomfort and opportunities are more a driving force than wickedness. Admittedly, this is not glamor, his colleagues hang out in a local hotel getting drunk and lamenting their fate as the news of the war gets worse (as noted, you have to listen to reports from the German and British radio). and divide the difference \'\' to find the truth) and they are progressively noticed by the emboldened inhabitants.

"b'Paul Verhoeven and Joe Eszter opened their film with the ultimate oxymoron of love and death: the moment of orgasm coincides with the moment of greatest agony and death. Never before has a film character been killed in the throes of orgasm. Never before has such a creative and controversial opening polarized public opinion of the first scene. Never before has orgasm in the cinema reached such a frightening, cynical and dark point with every counter-penetration of the murder weapon. The very concept of getting rid of a victim in this way in the first minutes of the film demonstrates the genius of the creators - and their ""mediocre"" taste. But this is just the beginning of a delightfully ironic, even amusing dance. between life and death which forms the twists and turns of Basic Instinct. Besides a film analysis of the infantile and simple level of sex and violence, a great film reaches an emotional intensity too, "" Scenes in which characters look at non-verbal communication access - and Basic Instinct scores 200% in this department. Directed by Verhoeven, director of photography Jan De Bont, and the actors themselves, the ""looks"" reach a particularly fine level when Curran and Gus meet Roxy for the first time in the scene ""his and his Picassos"" home . Verhoeven and again set the bar in the oceanfront scene on the deck in which Curran, Gus and Trammell meet for the first time. The cut and the movie score in this area are so beautiful that it hurts. It is surely the most beautiful score of Jerry Goldsmith, whose power throughout the production is invaluable. Nonverbal glances are the key, and Joe Eszterhas\'s famous dialogue makes Basic Instinct such a coherent and vital film A delightful character rub, this Basic Instinct is absolutely perfect - at least until the violent sex scene between Curran and his psychotherapist, which seemed unnecessary, but adds a touch of madness to Curran and Garner\'s relationship. The fact that this relationship is discussed openly in the department brings the final touch to contradiction and astringency. A great film simultaneously stimulates all parts of the mind, from the most intellectual to the most primitive, and the Basic Instinct of gore, emotionally satisfying interaction, and intellectually stimulating intrigue. Basic Instinct is jam-packed with classic and memorable scenes, but most scenes of sex and violence are definitely off the list. Verhoeven has to do it with taste and trick, of course. No missteps here. But who cares how they can make love or stab themselves? This is the trick between violence, fantastic interactions and thorny dialogue of one of the best movies ever assembled, which makes Basic Instinct so great. The scene with Dr. Lamott, Dr. Garner and all the police staff, particularly remarkable and satisfying, highlights the ambiguity and folly of the film\'s basic themes, again with the brilliant support of Goldsmith. the pinnacle of Michael Douglas\'s career - and Sharon Stone for that matter. Aside from Douglas\'s astute expressions, let\'s not forget this fabulous voice. Douglas is simply incredible and I have never liked seeing a main character attacked by all the other actors in the cast, especially his own people. A particularly underestimated performance of Denis Arndt, Lieutenant Walker, Curran\'s immediate supervisor. acridic and sardonic delicacy for the continuation of Curran\'s investigation. If characters like Curran and Walker are irritating, then Stone as Trammell is the ultimate lubricant, nothing sticks to it, it can easily get out of any situation. Basic Instinct dares to portray an invincible murderer without guilt, without weakness, who, as an antagonist, outweighs Curran\'s seduction. Finally, I would like to address Jan De Bont\'s beautiful camera movements, associated with long, multi-character dialogs loaded with camera movements, enhancing the European style and making this film one of the most enjoyable films to watch in Europe. terms of camera movement. The interaction of the camera and the actors is electrifying in its vitality. I really enjoyed Verhoeven and De Bont\'s comment on the Blu Ray. In his craft, Basic Instinct goes well beyond the average thriller to become the ultimate thriller against which all others must be measured. This film will last by far on its critics - the best Verhoeven film by far.'",1

He goes in search of the machine to change the wish; meanwhile he finds a job in a toy company. Basically, the film becomes a long joke about a ""child"" in the adult world, but it also tends to other problems - the loss of innocence and superficial honesty so prevalent in childhood and then gone adulthood. Hanks, of course, is a hit at the toy maker (which 13-year-old child would not be?).

"b'Robert Duvall is original in this captivating film. I say captivating, I could not turn it off, the numbering was very realistic almost with a documentary side, the action not too flashy or excessive had a realistic grain, and I had to know how it was going to end. As an artistic finalist, you really do not know what will happen to our protagonist, the hitman at the end. I throw the original word to this work for several reasons. The main character, ""John Anderson"", played by Duvall (although the same character we have seen playing before), is a hitman with a difference. . He does not regret the ""jobs"" he has done, but as he approaches the twilight of his life, he has not established real roots. Now, however, he has a girlfriend with a ten - year - old daughter, and his love and dedication for this child shines through, just like Duvall \'s love for the Tango played so well on a number of occasions by the very attractive Argentinian. Young and old. The assassination plot went to Tango for a good part of the film and when Duvall brings us back to his goal of being in Argentina, we are sorry to have to leave this beautiful dance behind us. There was a moment or two when Duvall\'s scenes could have been narrowed but I never felt that it was really bad. Overall, I would recommend this film to fans of indie films, dancers and Robert Duvall fans.'",1

His interpretation as a great artist is impeccable and shows a tender side. Moreover, Rex Harrison, as Pope Julius II, is also extraordinary. The two men create a refined chemistry of the rebellious artist and the stern but eager pontiff who commands Buonarroti the great task of the Sistine.

"b'Almost nine years after watching the film for the first time and nearly 34 years after the events, the movie ""Apollo 13"" seems even more captivating. The story of Apollo 13, for all those who followed the space program and especially for those who witnessed it, is a story as captivating as that told throughout American history. It is fraught with drama, intrigue, twists and dangers. Moreover, everything really happened! In April 1970, the American public already saw the tremendous success of the landing on the Moon as a past. and could not have been less concerned about the Apollo 13 mission. The interest was so apathetic that the astronaut was not even broadcast while the ship was about to enter the lunar orbit. The capricious public certainly had its pique interest when, shortly after the unsupervised broadcast, a simple maneuver cleaning the house (stirring the oxygen tanks) revealed a fatal flaw that caused a tremendous explosion. This explosion made Apollo 13 out of control, put an end to any hope of landing on the moon and left a lot of doubt about the fate of the three astronauts (Captain Jim Lovell, LM Fred Haise pilot and the pilot of the module Jack Swigert). The heroic efforts put forward by Mission Control members, as well as the astronauts themselves, to bring Apollo 13 back to Earth safely, are one of the greatest stories ever told. His own personal account of this mission has created one of the greatest historical movies ever shot on screen. Apollo 13 is a real cinematographic success. He rekindles the imagination and wonders if the space program was held in the 1960s and early 1970s. Using advanced special effects in the service of history (and not instead), Howard is able to give the public a close-up view of the Apollo mission. Using archival footage to create special effects scenes, the director is able to make the launch realistic, as if the viewer stood at the top of the tower and watched the rocket about to take off. The scenes in space are well designed and extraordinarily realistic. When astronauts are forced to stop a large portion of the lunar module and the entire control module to conserve energy, the public feels the cold and abject abandon that these men have had to undergo. The true mark of the greatness of this film lies in the fact that, although we know by history that the men of Apollo 13 have survived, the last moments of the season, as presented in the film, are still incredibly striking and tense. Then, the emotional release that comes from knowing they did it is so overwhelming that even the most cynical and hard-nosed viewer will feel choked. The narration and effects of Apollo 13 are excellent, but the film would probably still fall short if it is not the case for the huge cast engaged to play these roles. Tom Hanks is solid while the impressive Jim Lovell, Bill Paxton (who always seems to find a way in every blockbuster) is good as a confident rookie, Fred Haise, and Kevin Bacon gives an accurate representation of last-minute substitute Jack Swigert. Gary Sinise plays Ken Mattingly, astronaut Swigert replaced because of the fear of a measles infection, with appropriate melancholy. The other performance is that of Ed Harris, who plays director Gene Kranz. Harris really deserved his Oscar nomination for this performance and there is certainly a strong argument for him to win the award over Kevin Spacey, winner of the finalist actor. ""Apollo 13"", himself, was a serious contender for the honors of the best film, losing only in front of the brave ""Braveheart"". The only disconcerting question is why Ron Howard was omitted from the Best Director nominations (he should wait another 7 years before receiving his due for ""A Beautiful Mind""). Apollo 13 is not just a big thriller. it is also a revealing history lesson. This allows us to remember those wonderful days of the quest to reach the moon, as well as the drama of this endangered flight. These days, it is discouraging to realize that the space program has stagnated since these heady days. ""Apollo 13"" proves, without a doubt, that we still have the men with the will, the knowledge and the courage to take this space exploration to places beyond the imagination.'",1
"b""Zatoichi Vol. Four is as good as the first three volumes. Like some of the other episodes, they tend to look like some of the movies. Despite this, the series is excellent.

"b""During Barca Walter's interview with Al Pacino several years ago, she said it was Pacino's favorite role. But this film stands out despite this proclamation. This is the story of the underworld to riches with one of the biggest end of the film! Pacino plays a Cuban refugee thug, Tony Montana, who claws and scans (taking lives along the way) to the top of the cocaine world in Miami with the help of his right arm Manny Ray (Steven Bauer). Pacino plays this role with such passion and energy that he absolutely feeds this film from beginning to end. You can not leave the eyes of the man. He adds human dimensions to Tony Montana. It shows Montana 's humor, machismo, intelligence, leadership, guts and flaws. It even shows the soft side of Montana (the scene with Michelle Pfeiffer by the pool). Pacino really makes you love a character who is basically a ball game. Now, it's acting! There are memorable moments throughout this film and some are very graphic, but what is probably the highlight of this film is the big shoot-up scene at the end; The Sosa hitmen infiltrating the Montana area to kill him because Montana missed a major blow for Sosa. When Montana, full of cocaine, finally focuses his attention on the hitmen, he defends himself by challenging them completely with a machine gun / grenade launcher. & quot; Say hello to my boyfriend! & quot; is now one of those famous movie lines from the history of cinema. He blows them up like dominoes, resisting gunshots from cocaine in his system. This is a real & quot; the guy is & quot; scene Its action is fueled by high octane adrenaline and Pacino plays the card of belief. His performance is so exhilarating that you want to catch a machine gun and fight at his side. Pacino IS Scarface! The DVD comes with great benefits such as theatrical trailers, production notes, biographies of filmmakers and directors, making SCARFACE (with Pacino) and 10 movie releases. The film is in letterbox format but is not digitally enhanced. It would have been nice to see the movie improved but it does not hurt the experience of watching this movie. In fact, I really do not care. It's SCARFACE!""",1
"b'When Bruce Lee moved on in 1973, two films were put together to try to take advantage of Bruce Lee\'s mania by putting together some of Lee\'s best moments in the Green Hornet series and achieving 2 90 minutes. ""Bruce Lee movies"" to the joy of those who were worried about other Bruce Lee\'s images. The first was entitled ""Green Hornet"", the second was curiously titled ""Fury of the Dragon. `` What we have here is the official sequel to the first 90-minute Green Hornet feature. An identical approach in that the production is composed of different scenes from the Green Hornet television series ... and the result? Despite good times and good memories of Bruce Lee becoming a superhero and hearing his true voice, we end up with 90 minutes of clumsy splicing of stories that do not get married. I even remember seeing some fighting scenes from the first movie. If you ask me, what we have here is a shadow of what would happen in 1978 ... The Bruce Lee massacre by Game Of Death, from 20th Century Fox. The only difference was that they brought together the images alone rather than launching an unconvincing double with 10 minutes of real footage. Anyway, this one is a guardian for the fans of Bruce Lee, the one who will be worth a lot in the near future.

"b'On my short list of movie titles not to be missed in 2011, Jose Padilha\'s ""Elite Squad: The Enemy Within"" was certainly at the top of the list. I first realized Padilha with the 2002 feature documentary ""Bus 174"", a true and unforgettable story of a bus hijacking that was very public in the Brazilian media. It was a poignant image that had as much to say about contemporary journalism, rampant crime, local corruption, political maneuvering, and the state of the police as it was about the actual event she described. I think it is fair to say that some of these same themes have remained a constant in all future film projects of the author / director. That said, I want to point out that ""Elite Squad: The Enemy Within"" is actually a continuation of the 2007 project titled (you guessed it) ""Elite Squad. ""Although both films are certainly more useful as companions, they have a story in their own right that can be appreciated on their own merits. If you choose to see this without seeing the first frame, you may miss part of the character\'s story, but the scenario allows you to become familiar with it quickly and efficiently. The film focuses on the character of Captain Nascimento. actually played by Wagner Moura. Moura is responsible for a special criminal unit and when a riot in the prison goes badly, human rights defenders (led dramatically by his ex - wife \'s new husband) question tactics and decisions. of the brigade. Public opinion, however, is on the side of Moura\'s quick and uncompromising action and places it in an even more powerful position. By targeting the elimination of the Rio drug crisis, it targets the lower-class slums where the problem has the greatest weight. But by eliminating the obvious enemy, he could give way to a more unexpected enemy. As unscrupulous policemen and politicians argue over the new power, Moura begins to realize he has cut off a monster\'s head to see another (more damaging) one. Unable to trust those in power, he sees new allies in the media and activists who once criticized Moura\'s methods. The filming is compelling and credible and undeniably scary. The film is shot in a rigorous documentary style that makes the inconvenience all the more tangible. Although the narrative may be a little too much on the analysis of the voiceover, Moura\'s point of view remains in perspective, because the great story leaves him on the sidelines for large portions of the action. In essence, this is a morality game disguised as a ruthless crime saga - but in the same vein, it is surprisingly underrated. The character changes are subtle and the action is inexorably real. It is difficult to imagine that the film can have a happy or satisfying conclusion, but what remains to us certainly seems appropriate, even if it does not sum it all up in a pretty little bow. In the end, the characters distinguish this piece (Moura is fantastic) which has universal relevance in its themes of corruption and those who fight it. ""Elite Squad: The Enemy Within"" is a rare image that will make you think during the entertainment. About 4 1/2 stars. KGHarris, 2/12.'",1

"b'""Destination Moon"" and ""Rocketship XM"" both came out the same year - but that\'s where the similarity ends. I consider ""Destination Moon"" as the father of the modern science fiction film. The quality of the production and the magnificent Technicolor give this film a quality that few sci-fi movies from the 50\'s could achieve. What helps this flem is the fact that there are no real stars - but very competent players and very recognizable at a minimum. ""Rocketship XM"", meanwhile, was a pressed film designed to beat ""Moon"" at theaters. The print quality in black and white is beautiful, having been restored to its original quality. Lloyd Bridges stars. The special effects for ""XM"" were suitable for their time, but the effects for ""Moon"" were ahead of their time. If I wrote down these films, I would give ""..Moon"" a B + and ""XM"" a C +. Both films are nice and make beautiful pieces of accompaniment.'",1

"b'Here is an enigma for all of you. What do you call ten liters of ice cream and a spoonful of manure? Ten gallons of manure. I do not care how much they dress the DVD version of this movie, it will not change the fact that it\'s terrible. I only give this star, but keep about five or six Advil at hand. That should be enough to cover you for that. A few jokes about this disaster: 1. It was directed by Uwe Boll, director of two of the most dreadful movies I have ever seen in ""House of the Dead"" and ""Alone in the Dark"". In what was a moment of brutal honesty for me, Boll himself admitted that he did not shoot the film until two weeks before filming began. What he ended up saying was a group of ""names"" who had a hole in their schedule and who came forward for a quick paycheck and a free trip to Romania. It can also be seen, the whole film has the impression of avoiding repetitions and no one seems even interested in making an honest effort. Will Sanderson and Michael Madsen may have discovered the only way to survive a Boll movie. They would have been completely drunk in all the production.4. Ben Kingsley, who had previously had to deal with Madsen on the film \'Species\', refused to be with him.5. In the harem scene with Meatloaf, these are HONEST TO GOD, 100% PROSTITUTES OF ROMAN. I swear you can not do that. Apparently, Boll could not afford real actresses (their unionization rate made them too expensive), so he decided to cut costs by placing an order for the real one. It\'s a disaster from the front to the back. I\'ll give it though, it\'s better than his last two movies. Bloodrayne, at least, is a bit unintentionally funny. Even saying that, I could never recommend anyone to see it. It only encourages the man to continue. Uwe Boll, undoubtedly in my mind, is the most talented director I have ever seen. I\'m absolutely amazed that this guy continues to find his place behind a camera ...'",0

I've danced most of my life so most of the workout exercises low impact I'm already familiar with, but the repetition is beautiful, and I'm just a little sore the next day every time I do low-impact exercise. High impact training is another story. I did it once since I got the DVD and I could hardly walk the next day! ! It comes from a dancer who is in very good shape. The high impact workout is mainly composed of squats. As soon as I get over the last time I did it, I'll do it again because it feels good and it's so good for you! There is an extra workout for both arms and abs. Each group has Dallas cowboys cowboys demonstrating. Three cheerleaders have been selected to do beginner, intermediate and advanced exercises, so you can choose the one you want to follow. The only thing that bothers me is that the coach who runs the coaches speaks a lot. He is very motivational, however, and especially people who are not very familiar or motivated in training would benefit. I was hesitant to buy a workout DVD because of their disappointment and lack of motivation to do them more than a few times, but this DVD is an exception.It is very fun, takes less than an hour of my day , and I can choose exactly the intensity or ease that I want to take on a daily basis.

Meanwhile, Hackman\'s own marriage is struggling, and the scenario is intelligently parallel to this disintegration with layers of deception and corruption exposed as he dismisses the mystery of his case.

"b""Nothing new happens in this film. It has a lot of action, mostly in the form of explosions, but nothing in the movie advances the story line Terminator. The viewer goes where he entered. The frustrating thing is that the film insults the viewer's intelligence with lazy things. For example, there are scenes involving the movement of massive rattling machines, but the characters are not even aware of the machines until the machines are above them. Or consider that barrels of oil or gas, or tubes of molten metal or liquid nitrogen are conveniently ubiquitous so that the characters can shoot them down when necessary to make an explosion or melt the machine. They play one after the other for about two hours. Nothing else is happening. We did not learn anything new. My recommendation is to spend this horrible addition to the T series.""",0

Bloodrayne marks Boll's third video game for film adaptation, and like those who preceded him (House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark), Bloodrayne is so bad that you have to see it to believe it. Kristanna Loken, best known for her game and her performance in Terminator 3, plays the role of the vampire heroine in this incoherent mess that, for one reason or another, also stars Ben Kingsley, winner of an Oscar. The plot is the typical human VS vamps affair, but the most intriguing aspect of Bloodrayne is just how did Boll manage to get those actors in this movie? It's astounding how Kinglsey, Michael Madsen, Michelle Rodriguez and Billy Zane all got together, all of which sparked the most awesome dialogue you could hear. From time to time the action and blood are pretty decent, but Bloodrayne is best appreciated as an involuntary comedy. Matt Davis, Meat Loaf, the favorite of Boll Will Sanderson and the faithful Udo Kier are also there.""",0

"b'+++++ This film is based on the musical piece ""Cabaret"" (also called ""Goodbye Berlin""). The music and lyrics are from the big John Kander and Fred Ebb respectively. It was directed by, and the dance and music numbers were staged by the late Bob Fosse. Personally, I\'m not much for musicals, but this film is more than just a great musical. Do not believe that there are just songs and dances. There is also a good story about corruption, decadence and false dreams of Berlin in the early 1930s, when Hitler came to power. The story follows the life of Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) during this turbulent period. She is the so-called star of the Kit Kat nightclub who has a mischievous master of ceremonies (Joel Gray). Writer Brian Roberts (Michael York) intrudes into Sally\'s world, hoping to take the vacant room in front of his. He soon learns that she is a ball of fire and energy. She tells us her dream: ""I\'m going to be a big movie star. That is, alcohol and sex do not appeal to me first. `` The film alternates between real life and hard outside Kit Kat nightclub and carefree life indoors where attendees can forget about their troubles and troubled times. the drama of real life outside. Five songs from Broadway\'s original production did not appear in the film as ""interpreted"" songs, but appeared as background music. The music, the costumes, the choreography and the game are all exquisite. Minnelli\'s performance, impressive on stage and equally convincing, is particularly impressive. Added to this is Gray\'s fascinating performance as Master of Ceremonies, which infuses humor and pathos as well as effervescence and solidity. The last scene of singing and dancing performed by Minnelli is historic and unforgettable! This film has won eight Oscars including Best Actress (Minnelli), Best Supporting Actor (Gray) and Best Director (Fosse). Finally, the DVD itself (released in 2003) is perfect in image quality and sound. He has a long list of interesting extras. In conclusion, I recommend going to this cabaret (old boyfriend). You will never want to leave! ! (1972, 2 hours, widescreen, 32 scenes) +++++'",1

It's a story of the Second World War that has not been told yet, and the Ritchie Boys themselves make it a captivating film and a wonderful story.

Personal note: In the 70\'s, I met the late Budd Boetticher as a friend. We were going to horseback at Griffith Park with his Andalusians and we made several trips to Mexico where he still practiced his dangerous and adored horse riding bulls. In life and in movies, he seemed obsessed with the role played by the male antagonist in his constant struggle against his environment.

"b""Stereotyped characters, convoluted logic and abundant lack of intelligence are found in & quot; Domestic disturbance, & quot; a thriller that wants to be mean, but ends up playing nicely. What begins with a rather interesting film resonates in an endless pit of incredible twists and aggravating characters who make all the wrong choices. Here is a film that covers a familiar terrain, but does not attract much interest when things go wrong. John Travolta plays Frank Morrison, a boat builder whose ex-wife Susan (Teri Polo) is about to remarry. This, of course, is unacceptable for their 12-year-old son, Danny (Matthew O'Leary), whose explosions against his parents' divorce led to being picked up at the police station on numerous occasions. Like any good father, Frank advises Danny to accept what he can not change and to welcome his new father-in-law, the rich and popular Rick Barnes (Vince Vaughn). Now, anyone who knows his thrillers can guess that if there is money involved, then there is usually a tainted past here and there; this film is no exception. The wedding goes off without a hitch, despite the presence of Ray Coleman (Steve Buscemi), a former acquaintance of Rick 's who will collect a large sum of money from his former friend. One thing leads to another, devices appear, and Rick has a murder on his hands, without knowing that Danny has witnessed the act of the backseat of the car in which he occurred. This is the first in a series of scenes that look promising but have little intensity or surprise. Judging by Danny 's & quot; Boy who shouted Wolf & quot; syndrome, it is easy to predict that no one will believe him when he reveals what he has seen except Frank, who must hold grudge to his son's abuser if there must be an action or an energy in the history. There's a little bit of cat and mouse going on, Frank is looking for the missing ray and possible clues to pass on to the police, but that does not lead to anything. The film seems more interested in showing us how stupid people can be in such situations, even if they are incredible. From the beginning, Susan stands by his side to defend him against Danny's accusations. Does he ever think that when a strange event occurs, Rick is out of the house at the same time? Does she ever stop thinking about how her disbelief in her son's statements affects her, rather than the old song-dance about her marriage to Rick? Even the police are completely helpless, ignoring everything to the end when it matters little. My big complaint with & quot; Domestic disturbance & quot; is his publisher, which has reduced the film to just 88 minutes, too short for a thriller and too long for a documentary about vengeful fathers. Paramount's advertising campaign for the film hit us with a large number of TV commercials in preview, as well as a long revealing theatrical trailer. There are scenes in both cases, one involving a car chase, the other involving a discussion between Rick and Frank in which Rick tries to buy it. These and other glimpses are not even included in the final cut and may have been more interesting than what we see here. The highlight is the standard forage, but it has the ability to generate more intensity than the rest of the film. Travolta makes a good performance, convincing us of his loving father status; Vaughn does not manage to create a sense of threat, while Polo does little more than look completely helpless. For all its attributes (which are few), & quot; Domestic disturbance & quot; adds nothing new to a used genre; his absence of lucid conspiracy could be neglected if not for his inability to generate a certain level of suspense. Note: The film was shot on the east coast of North Carolina, in Southport, but in one scene, Ray mentions that his location was a memory of Rick's childhood about family vacations in Maryland. Your thoughts, Mr. McNally?""",0
"b'I like a good vampire movie, be it scary like ""Nosferatu"" or campy like ""The Lost Boys"". Unfortunately, I can not say as much for Bloodrayne who is neither scary nor camping. What I did not like most about this movie turkey was the way it was published. There was no real beginning. Everything the viewer learns about Rayne (Kristanna Loken) goes through a series of boring flashbacks. I can not believe that Oscar winner Ben Kingsley was linked to this awful movie. At least, ""Species"" was scary, disgusting and entertaining. ""Bloodrayne"" is neither one nor the other. Until now, I had never thought that a love scene could be so funny (involuntarily) before seeing Rayne and Sebastian take care of it. It was so bad that it was funny. Although the two Underworld films do not really offer anything substantial, at least these films were entertaining, but Bloodrayne was not. Bad game, bad writing, bad everything. Apparently, Hollywood has not learned from past disasters that video games do not make good movies (that is, ""Super Mario Bros."" and ""Mortal Kombat"" movies).'",0

He takes the time to explain the rationale for the practice, which seems like a good idea to tell those of us who are learning exclusively through DVDs. The two songs you learn here, a classic, a bossa nova, are nice pieces and its teaching pace is a little faster. In other words, it gives a lot of information beyond what you could imagine. My problems with the DVD are two. On the one hand, as with other DVDs from this publisher, you pay nearly thirty dollars for sixty minutes of DVDs. Traum is also a good teacher, but it seems too expensive. There are other offers that are better and free similar information on the web, so I'm not completely satisfied with that. The second problem is that the exercises with fingers are pretty basic. I use more complex patterns than the ones he gives in the daily game, and for me it seemed simple (I will certainly do them, though) and I worked the most for myself. The only exercise that seemed to me to be intermediate was the arpeggios, in third and second positions, which concerned more the technique of the left hand than the right hand. The two songs, however, are beyond the beginner, more intermediate. It seems to me that most buyers will be disappointed by any of the 60 minutes of this DVD. 60 minutes of exercises, more and more complex. I guess the average shopper would find that too boring (teach me songs, they would say), but I'm very interested in getting better and learning other instruments that repetitive exercises are the way to go. I wanted a DVD guide for these, rather than a big book printed from them, and that's not quite what I had hoped for.

His emotional performance of a man who lost his wife to cancer and is now facing the potential loss of his daughter because of the same disease is heartbreaking. His relationship with his two sons also brings a reality to a parent's love for his children and the torment of his singing career. His band of the 50s and he was a great success, but were quickly removed from the limelight. Over the next 30 years, he works as a bartender and his band plays for weddings. If you like doo-wap and Assante, you'll love this movie. Nostalgia at its best I recommend taking the audio CD and reading it before seeing the movie, so you will really appreciate it.""",1
"b'For the big fans of Manhunter, I advise you not to use this DVD if you plan to own ... What was billed as ""& quot;"" Theater & quot; the version is actually a poorly edited version that clumsily edits two scenes that were in the theatrical release, including one of the most essential scenes, and yet contains some of the most mundane images restored from the floor of the hall cutting. These cuts are poorly made and do not make any sense to them, considering how they do not represent the release in theaters and destroy the momentum of what had been a finely edited film. I do not know if it was ignorance or arrogance, but it\'s the worst hacking job I\'ve ever seen trying to pretend to be a product. Whoever was responsible for that in Anchor Bay was an idiot and if I were Michael Mann, I would call my lawyers. The & quot; Director\'s Cup & quot; is even worse in that it includes the & quot; Non-theatrical & quot; release AND the so-called & quot; Director\'s Cup & quot; - a compilation of some interesting and uninteresting catches. In addition to a real theatrical release, it would have been a fascinating addition. But here again, Anchor Bay finds a way to ruin what should be a good product. The entire movie that has not been submitted to video post-production is stained and blurred, as if it had been transferred from a VHS cassette - and worn out. - just amazing that anyone can have the audacity to offer this kind of low price for hard earned money. I saw this movie when it first appeared in the theater and considered it one of the best of this year; and I rushed to buy the LaserDisc version when it came out. When Anchor Bay released the director\'s DVD this year, I was on the waiting list, ready to welcome the big-screen THX version. Being intimately aware of the film, imagine my disappointment. Do not waste your time. Wait for a better version to go out. As for those who want to compare Silence of the Lambs to Manhunter, they generally prefer each other and their ideas are pretty well established at this point. I\'m right in Manhunter\'s camp. For me, I enjoyed Silence, but I could never take it seriously, because I found Lector\'s portayal both superhuman and surreal and therefore unrealistic. However, Lector by Manhunter is a terrifying but more realistic portrait that intrigues me every time I see it in the way that an evil genius manages to manipulate events outside his cell by simply using a phone. This Lector is safe behind the steralized bars - and yet still manages to be a powerful presence with which to count. and edgey, and yet that flowed gracefully. Siskel and Ebert ranked it among the best films, years after its release. But for now, I\'m going to keep my LaserDisc.'",0
"b'One of the most enjoyable movies of the 80s is Big, in which Tom Hanks ... well, you already know it. I loved almost everything in this 2-disc set. A MAJOR gotcha, however. Or maybe two, depending on how you look at it. If you play Extended Cut (Disc 1) with the comment set to On, you get a) without comment, and b) a Spanish soundtrack. Comment set to On, you get practically nothing but comment. As far as I know, no dialogue box of the film can be heard. Playing theatrical or extended versions with Comment set to Off is a good thing.'",1
"b'It\'s my fault that I was expecting more from this movie, but I guess this movie was not made for guys like me. The acting is good, the character of Matthew McConaughey, Ben and Kate Hudson, Andie, must act and react. Dialogue does not matter. The character of Kate Hudson still has the upper hand, which is good for a moment, but after an hour, it becomes tiring. She completely invades every aspect of Ben\'s life; we do not even see Andie\'s world apart from her two friends and her workplace. So, although the two characters have a similar program, there is a complete imbalance between the superiority, and this represents for me the biggest gap in the film. He supports all his attempts to ""lose"" it, but all this only produces frustration for Andie - and helps him do more crazy things. As a spectator, you\'re dying to see her fall once on her face. But it is wishful thinking. Ben \'s resilience to Andie\' s antics just distracted me and Andie \'s total lack of shame did not please me. Of course, they both look great, and Hudson shines positively when she smiles, but the man, 112 minutes, is long to endure this game. I can imagine that some people think this movie is awesome. Girl Power and everything. I do not know . But I think we can agree that the film was designed as a vehicle for the rise of Kate Hudson. This film reminds me a bit of WHAT WOMEN WANT (with Mel Gibson) for a variety of reasons, but mostly because it was written and produced by women - which, in the world of male-dominated cinema, is an indispensable prospect - but Nancy Myers producer / director of What Women\'s Want) is significantly smarter than the ""brains"" of How To Lose A Guy in 10 days. Just watch additional DVDs to see the evidence. We meet two of the producers, both of whom have obviously had facelifts. I\'m serious . It\'s scary. They talk about matter like Shakespeare\'s. Then there\'s director Donald Petrie, who has absolutely no charisma. The MAKING OF with it is so cheap that it\'s probably funnier to watch than most movies. While seated to chat, a television screen behind him triggers images of the film, and an office worker (back to the camera) stares at a static screen while biting his fingernails and shaking his head. She does this for the duration of the interviews with Petrie. Oh, and did I mention the background music that accompanies the extras? It\'s the music of department stores. Or elevator music. Whichever one you hate more. I did not care about the comment. Donald is an enemy. There is no release, which is now unusual for a comedy. The deleted scenes are actually good, honest emotions are shown by Andie and we have some quieter private moments between the two tracks. Look, it started ok. It looked like it would be a soft and harmless romantic comedy, but the romance lasted about 10 minutes. I can summarize my comment with this observation of why the director Petrie was interested in making the film. He says it was because he discovered that Kate Hudson was attached to it. Aha. So, basically, if the film is doing well at the box office, then it will launch Hudson and his career. Sorry Petrie, but that\'s not enough for me.'",0

"b""This is the romantic comedy by which all other romantic comedies are judged. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan have an undeniable chemistry and exceptional timing. And, surprisingly, Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher, who really have good moments for the film. This movie knows no one knows how to better present Manhattan than Woody Allen and that he borrows a lot from his traditions. Including the choice of romantic pop standards. As in Annie Hall, & quot; It must have been you is the centerpiece of music for an inevitable coupling. The dialogue is lively and rhythmic with an ear attentive to the New York sensibility. And also knows how to best show New York's hippest places. Even Billy Crystal is a bit nebulous. Yet this film is an original and its style has been imitated countless times by other films in the hope of capturing some of its magic. Yet none has the upper hand. The icing on the cake was the wonderful choice to interrupt the passing seasons of Harry and Sally's relationship with the old couple telling stories of their first encounter. The way they talk and tell stories is charming and authentic and makes you smile. When Harry Met Sally is a cheerful and very very funny movie that never gets tired, no matter how many times it's seen. It's a classic. The DVD contains an additional 7 minutes of deleted footage. In this case, it is pretty obvious why it was deleted. Look at your own risk. The audio commentary by Rob Reiner seems to have been broadcast at the forefront. Do not look for a lot of happy stories or ideas about the best ideas. The commented track is quite slow and dry. The & quot; Making of & quot; Documentary is a little more fun and insightful, so the extras are not a total wash. The sound and picture quality are both brilliant and lush, so the most important part of the disc, the movie, is as enjoyable as possible. When Harry Met Sally has a lot of fun with men and women trying to understand each other and makes us laugh a lot and even cry a little.""",1

Unlike the special edition of MAD MAX DVD, it is at best austere: a dolby 5.1 mix and subtitles ""passable"". That\'s all . The quality of the images is only ""acceptable"" (the dark scenes are very pixelated and difficult to understand!). No comment of director, no backstage, nothing. For a film that praises the LANDMARK in science fiction and is as influential as STAR WARS, the DVD available is a shameful disgrace. Why has nobody ever bothered to publish a special edition? We see so much ""trash"" coming out as ""special edition"" yet we still have to wait for a defensive DVD of MAD MAX 2. As you may have guessed, my review is about this most criminal offense. I rate MAD MAX 2 with an 11 (yes, it\'s a VERY entertaining movie) but the DVD really stinks. Let\'s hope Mr. Miller comes to his senses and pulls out a DVD package for the movie he\'s probably going to do. to be called back by!'",1
"b""I tape this tape because I love the firm tapes that I own, the older ones. This tape was a big disappointment for me. I did not have any sweat on this band but, at the same time, I could not follow them. They go from one stage to the next, as if you repeat each stage with them for six weeks before filming the tape. I was not coordinated at all. They took a step, then another and another, and I was still trying to find the first step. In doing this workout, I felt like a chicken with his head cut off. I'm just going to stay with their training bands. These are great, and they really tone you up! As for cardio, I recommend you spend an hour at Tae-Bo. They are easier to follow. You sweat a lot and explain each step before going to another.""",0
"b'I do not understand what constitutes a comedy nowadays. Here is another ""comedy"" that is not funny and that focuses too much on the same tired jokes, mainly related to sex, without trying to develop a scenario. The acting is banal, the script is below par and the direction seems uninspired. What a winner! Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy play the honeymooners who, at the beginning of the film, come back from what was clearly not a beautiful honeymoon. They act like children, throwing themselves into the walls and throwing gum into each other\'s hair. We return to their meeting (Kutcher striking her face with a football) and the romance that follows. He is a journalist specializing in the traffic of cemeteries for a radio station, while she had all the training possible and is passionate about art. The honeymoon is in Europe. You must immediately realize what will be some of the jokes. How about trying to plug something from the United States into the wall when the plugs are not suitable and the current is twice as powerful? ... Ha Ha. Then there are jokes about European hygiene, with huge insects crawling on our heroes when they are in the next hotel. Driving in Europe? Then you have to get one of those European cars the size of a suitcase that can not be of a worse shade of yellow. Oh, and no extra points to guess that an old Murphy flame will appear and try to steal it. In short, this film is bad. It\'s not the worst thing I\'ve ever seen, which is why it has two stars instead of one. But it\'s a brainless story, we\'ve already seen it. We have just seen it better.'",0

"b'Reviewers who watched the DVD version of Region 2 of this movie insist that the extra 10 minutes of this release make all the difference. This version misses the mark. How could he miss it with Ben Elton writing and directing and Hugh Laurie and Joely Richardson in the lead roles? Answer: He skips the process that the couple has to go through to reach a certain peace with their situation. One scene ""everything is lost"" and ""presto chango"" in the next one is all resolved. This leaves the main characters as cardboard cutouts for a comic plot. It\'s still worth watching the stylish BBC sendings, the modern London and some very entertaining scenes. Richardson is dazzling and Laurie is charming and wonderful. Laurie\'s sperm test song is a keeper.

The count was much more subtle and devious in the book and never let himself be taken by the hands.

It is a beautiful story of grace, as DeNiro tries to pay the ransom of his guilt and begins to discover the mercy and unconditional love of God. At the same time, questions arise about the motives of missionary work. They should be inspired by the love of God, but other aspirations have been the driving force of many people throughout history. As in the Crusades, there were very well-meaning Christians, but there were also many who killed and conquered in the name of a God of love.

"b'I would not have bought this product if I had read a review similar to the one I write. I saw Tracy Anderson on Oprah, dancing with Gwenyth Paltrow - having fun and looking healthy. I had years of ballet training, I\'m in great shape and I respect Gwenyth\'s lifestyle choices - so I bought the DVD. The method can be effective, but you must be able to learn the routines. This would have helped the presentation and was more professional to have presented the steps by name (ie French, for example, glisade, jete, or English, for example, slide, change). Then, after allowing students to lean back [what TA does], it would have been fun and effective if each routine had been set to music as students ""performed"" their work. Instead, the 8 routines are presented first - each front view, back view - slowly, quickly - and without music. The beginning of the DVD (trying to learn the routines) gives the impression of slowly practicing Swedish gymnastics while a coach counts from 1 to 8 times and again - it\'s boring and that does not mean to dance. I never learned the choreography after the first routine. I tried to jump to dance (with music) but I never did the music routines and I did not call the steps of the steps, I could not follow a cardio workout.'",0

"b'I\'ve said it before and I\'ll say it again: the studios really have to stop letting the small amateur production companies release their films on DVD. This Laurel & Hardy DVD is a great example of why. The most obvious and most infuriating problem is that the soundtrack is not synchronized with the action; it\'s about 2 seconds behind. If you do not like ""boys"" as a dubbed Japanese movie, it will drive you crazy. The quality of the image is also very bad. I have a VHS copy of ""Flying Deuces"" that looks better than that. The quiz was a good idea, but poorly executed; ""What color are Stan Laurel\'s hair? \'\' How could I know - all their movies are black and white! Oy.

"b'This is not a criticism of the quality of DVD, cinematography, gaming, etc., but rather the essential element of what I consider to be the smartest movie of the year, even if it is not is not imperfect. * Spoiler alert * From what I read, it seems that most of these reviewers did not grasp the ambiguity of the end or, if they did, they found it too implausible. The old group (most moviegoers), not realizing the ambiguity of whether he had really done that or not, seemed to miss the last line coming back to the conversation with the director, the philosophical knot of the film, to which Leo is resistant to accepting that the nature of man is violent. If nothing else, the last line suggests that if he really did what they say, he has at least some level of self-knowledge, his craziness and refusing to live with her. Or he may have always been sane, that he was really right about what was going on and refused to accept their suggested recollections and the opinion of the director, but realizing that he did not could ever escape and decide to die of heroes Regarding what some have said, this last premise is too incredible, I do not agree. Why is it so hard to believe that a country would be incapable of something like this? During the period in which this film unfolds, most US states continue to sterilize the mentally and physically disabled. Would it be such an important moral step to turn to the experience of psychotic criminals, of people without a future, for the sake of our national security, of our way of life, of our dominance in world affairs? Of course, this interpretation of the end of the film is problematic. It would be a coincidence if the four names were really anagrams of themselves. He has dreams all the way through the film that allude to the finale, even before the explanation was suggested by the doctor (although I only saw it once and something could be missing). with Rachel, so why was there a total lack of surrealism, unlike all other sequences of this kind? The practical answer, to convince the public until the end, is not credible. The contradictions here seem to come from the fact that Scorsese revisits the same theme he explored at the end of the ""King of Comedy"", and the same style: one wonders if this really happened or if everything is in the mind of the character. I did not read the book, but from what I understood, Scorsese added a layer not present in Lehane\'s work, where everything is simply in the spirit of the character, similar to ""The Machinist"" (do not hit Lehane). : with his psychological depth and his misanthropic view of human nature, he is the heir of the great Clouzot - but probably with more success in ""Mystic River"". By adding ambiguity in the end without modifying some points of the plot to start, gaps in logic appear. If it were to be cleaned up a bit, I would not hesitate to classify ""SI"" with ""Raging Bull"" and ""Taxi Driver"". Despite this, it\'s still one of the good ones.'",1

"b'I have been a fan of X-Men since I was 9 years old. In recent years, comics have become obsolete and almost impossible to follow (a situation that Marvel Comics has repressed lately), and despite the fact that the first X-Men movie had more than one chance, I really did not think about it. So I tried to keep my expectations low for the X-2 ... The good news is that it\'s MUCH better than its predecessor! X-2 does not need to bombard viewers with so much information (since this has been supported in the first movie), and can virtually hit the ground. We resume where the first film stopped: Magneto is in prison, Wolverine looks for clues about his past and anti-mutant hysteria is endemic. Enter William Stryker, a hate fanatic employed by the government, excellently played by Brian Cox. He sends the blue-skinned Nightcrawler mutant to demolish the White House and strike the president in the awesome opening sequence, ensuring presidential cooperation with the anti-mutant agenda. Stryker does not waste time setting up a secret strike team, and their first target is ... Professor Xavier\'s school. It looks like they have chosen the wrong time to visit, though; The children are alone at home with their ""babysitter"" ... Let\'s prepare ourselves at RUMMMMBBBLLEEEE! ! ! Before you know it, it\'s the total war between Stryker and the assembled mutant faction; Magneto is out of jail, Xavier and Cyclops are captured and used by Stryker, and the scene is preparing for a fight at Alkali Lake, where Wolvie might discover interesting information about his skeleton and his Adamantium claws. Fans disappointed by the lack of action in the first film will be in their glory here, as the number of fights has increased, including an excellent duel between Wolverne and Deathstrike, played by the beautiful Kelly Hu, and the Wolverine berserker rages in the mansion. Love the way he sends Stryker\'s criminals ...! Director Bryan Singer has put together an excellent cast and each character is doing well. The new additions, Cox and Hu, do a great job with their respective roles and the end sets the stage for X-3. Long-time fans will love X-Men\'s pillar appearances such as The Beast, Colossus, Siryn, Artie and Kitty Pryde, and will be on the lookout for the likes of Gambit and Franklin Richards, among others. Bad news ... ? The film starts strong but trails a little towards the end; Maybe a tighter fitting was needed. Also, given the heaviness of the movie about the characters and situations developed by the Chris Claremont comic book scribe, including the intrigue of his legendary graphic novel ""God Loves, Man Kills,"" I was more than a little dismayed not to see him recognized in the credits. X-2 is not a perfect movie, but it\'s a big step forward from the previous X-Men movie, and a great way to start the summer season.'",1

If you're into this new wave of Japanese splash movies, then you know what to expect, and Tokyo Gore Police is among the best of its kind. However, Media Blasters dropped that ball. Or rather, someone in their art department is incredibly lazy. The back cover has been copied and pasted from their 2-disc DVD edition. This Bluray version is a disc, not two. In addition, the listed bonuses (short TGP movies, behind the scenes) are not on the disc. What you get is a trailer for the movie and for other versions of Tokyo Shock.

"b'Ally McBeal has ended for good, even if this compilation of episodes reminds us of what was great. Focusing on Ally (Flockhart), still single, slender and crazy, the public is led into her hallucinations (brilliantly realized via an impressive computer animation), her loves, her losses and her work in a law firm that seems to embrace the \'strange. What made this show awesome was that it was so different, with David E. Kelley\'s sharp writing bringing a mix of well-placed observations on modern relationships and absolutely hilarious characters. Who could forget John Cage (McNicol), the small lawyer with a domestic frog and a craze for Barry White? Add to that Richard Fish, who seems to wallow in his own male chauvanism, ""Subzero"" Nelle (diRossi) and the deliciously naughty Ling (Liu) and you have a hot cast that is pretty nice of it all. Recent episodes have been criticized for not being funny enough, this may seem unfair, although there is still a tendency to be nostalgic of the old episodes proposed here. It balances remarkably well, romantic and sad, and these first episodes were truly revolutionary, paving the way for other more experimental shows. However, it would be nice to see the seasons in full because they are available in the UK.'",1
"b""Down Argentina Way is a delicious and light musical from the early 1940s that should appeal to anyone who loves this type of movie. We get great performances from big stars, including Betty Grable, Don Ameche, Carmen Miranda and the incredible dancing Nicholas Brothers! The plot is moving at a good pace and the acting was quite convincing. The action begins when Glenda Crawford (Betty Grable) and her mother Binnie Crawford (Charlotte Greenwood) are once again on the circuit. It seems that the Crawford family has always loved horses and they run them too. Glenda sees a beautiful racehorse and she wants to buy the horse, but the horse belongs to Don Diego Quintana (Henry Stephenson), a crab who has a long and stupid grudge against Willis Crawford, the patriarch of The Crawford family. Be that as it may, Glenda and Binnie are going to Argentina after their first attempt to buy horses in Quintana. It is not long either that Glenda falls in love with Quintana's son, Ricardo Quintana (Don Ameche), who is also seduced by Glenda. The young couple tries to get Glenda Crawford to Don Quintana as Glenda Cunningham in the hope that he will love her and then not worry about being a Crawford; but that also has its complications. Meanwhile, there is a horse for the race - will Don Quintana ever leave the horse race? It's a fragile sub-plot, but the few horse races we see in this film reinforce the action; and everything is fine with me! Look for great numbers of songs and dances - remember that these intrigues were only excuses for the studio to film fabulous songs and dance numbers. According to rumors, after the audience first saw The Nicholas Brothers, they so encouraged the projectionist to redo the film to show their stage again! Charlotte Greenwood also has a great ability to play with her legs as she happily dances in another issue. Betty Grable also dances very well. In addition, this film marks the debut of Carmen Miranda's film; she sings some songs during the film and a short melody at the very beginning of the film. Carmen shines even when they do not play it as much as in later movies! The DVD comes with an extra superlative on Betty Grable's life and times. She really looked like a particularly sweet girl who did not want to live too much and enjoyed her private life the best she could. The quality of the photos in the extra on Betty Grable is excellent. There is also a common but optional comment for people who want to know what was going on behind the scenes during the filming of this movie. Awesome ! Overall, Down Argentina Way is a musical that is worth the detour. I usually reserve five stars for a MGM musical; but this time, Fox has really succeeded! Fans of classic musicals can not afford to miss this one!""",1

"b""The review you see above, Amazonian criticism, I must say, is a load of shit. I just saw the movie today, and I went to see this movie with pretty low expectations, expecting a cheap thrill, the most important fights and a story that a six year old could have written in 5 minutes. However, I was pleasantly surprised after the first fight scene to see that there was a story, and contrary to what I thought, it was surprisingly deep and very well done. The above review, the Amazon Review caught my attention by stating that the fight scene was stupid for the fight was stimulated by a puppy. And if I had not seen the movie, I probably would have agreed that fighting for a puppy is a pretty stupid story, but if you look at the scene, it's rather moving to hear the dogs being killed and Introduce a view of an innocent puppy riding in a cold-blooded killer and stir something inside the clerick. I could go on longer, but I will not do it, I will end this criticism by saying that it is a movie magic of very high quality.

Make sure you have plenty of room to do this - will not really work for condo life if you have neighbors below you and you jump up and down. My other criticism is that during the cardio period, Tracy changes what she does and does not say enough what she does. For example, you stretch your hamstrings with your head tilted (so you can not watch TV), you are in that position for a while, then you look up and Tracy does something else ... the? ? ? She did not even say she was moving forward. I just feel that she is not very good with the details. I noticed it in his DVD Mat (very frustrating on this DVD). Moreover, I do not think she is very motivating or enthusiastic. She is introverted enough to make these DVDs. I thought she might be like Jillian from The Biggest Loser ...

"b'It seems that no other Broadway musical has ever been transferred so intact to the screen, with all the facets of his production sparkling and gloriously theatrical in his staging. River City, Iowa, of course, does not seem more realistic than the Land of Oz, but that\'s the way it should be. It\'s satire, and fortunately, the director Morton DaCosta keeps everything in perfect condition, preserved to play exactly as on stage, even with regard to the opening number aboard a train where all the salesmen sing a certain rabble as a music teacher. Mederedith Willson\'s music never sounded so good and she received songs and expert dances from ROBERT PRESTON, SHIRLEY JONES, PAUL FORD and HERMIONE GINGOLD, all helped and encouraged by some of the best singing and dancing you could ask in a comedy musical genre of this kind. Gingold is shockingly funny and Paul Ford, her husband, the mayor of River City, is also a comedian. But it\'s Preston\'s show from start to finish with co-star Shirley Jones in fine vocal form as a skeptical librarian. One of the most cleverly staged acts is the ""Marian, The Librarian"" which takes place in the municipal library where poles and balconies are part of the complex dance routine. All musical numbers are performed with professional charm by a talented group of actors / singers / dancers who are part of the River City population. Little Ron Howard, the crazy boy, who eventually became a director, stands out as Jones\' little brother.Summing up: An old-fashioned musical with his heart in the right place - Americana in the best tradition of the word.Summing: It has more charm than the law allows.'",1

Forced compliance, The famous game of ballooning with singing. Mortally accurate. Although the equipment is outdated and the ranch in the countryside where the Moonies have recruited is long closed, it's still a great movie to watch and show your children if you want to help them learn not to to be sucked into cults of all kinds.""",1

"b'To be honest, I watched the movie because of the talent behind it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with almost every aspect of this film. There are times when the action bounces between two sets of characters and situations (a fifth element) but there is little or no connection between the two situations, which leaves me dizzy and confused instead of being entertained or stimulated. There is a development of extreme character, like the many times we saw Peggy (Laura Dern) slip to take a brushstroke in her bottle or pour herself a drink. The idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bher alcholism strikes me to the point of annoying me, then I discovered that the fact that she has a problem of addiction has nothing to do with the plot, the interaction with the characters or what whatever else. Why did Robert Altman do the same? Filler? The obsession for the Kennedy family for Connie (Tara Reid\'s character) is another case where we spend a lot of time trying to show this side of the character and will never be followed later in the film. . Curiously, she is probably one of the most ""normal"" women on the photo. All this would have resulted in a mediocre film but the end really killed for me. I have no idea what the end is meant to mean. In fact, this reinforces the idea that the complete plot was derived by writers completing several pages of Mad Libs and then edited them into a scenario. There is really no other explanation to why so many aspects of the movie seem to be so random (or at best random).'",0
"b""Alice in Wonderland is the story of a little girl lost in a land of nonsense. A country of nonsense! This film has almost no nonsense. It's more like a Harry Potter movie than Alice in Wonderland. I wanted Alice. Alice is trapped in a surreal wonderland where everything is insane and there are tons of word games, word games, and so on. And the name of Alice in Wonderland. This is not this story. They should call it Return to Wonderland: The Battle to Create a Harry Potter Movie with Alice Characters.""",0
"b""I am an aspirant for any film or historical play, and that fits perfectly with the days when women had few rights. Sometimes we have to look at history to see how we have progressed from that time. Women have come a long way for their independence and the right to live their lives in their own way. I suggest that parents let their children know how lucky they are to be able to choose the man you want to marry, not what is good for the family. Marriages were arranged and most marriages were considered only as biblical roommates. Men have always had their mistress to turn to when their wife was not available (pregnant) and if they were expelled from their bed and considered to be in the kennel. The film really portrayed how little control women had over their future. Now, about the movie, it's the true story of this duchess and her life. I thank someone from the outside for setting up a real historical piece like the duchess. I would recommend to everyone to watch this film and to know how blessed we are today to be able to make our own choices in life, whether good or bad.""",1
"b""It's a movie that I remember with emotion, but I was very disappointed by this transfer (from 905 Entertainment); the colors faded and the soundtrack was very coarse and almost impossible to list - indeed, the very opening of the superlative partition of Vaughan Williams was cut in this version.

"b""It's a beautiful film Hopkins' performance is a study of the method, the acting method ... it's one of the best performances I've ever seen on film. The character is so structured and constrained, his chance of happiness he misses, it is tragic and heartbreaking. The score is dead and the film captures perfectly the arrogance of the English aristocracy before the Second World War. The film shows how classes interact, and for an American, like me, it's fascinating ... and so foreign. This DVD has some great, especially deleted scenes. This is my personal favorite of the great Merchant-Ivory collaboration, although Howards End and Room With a View are also excellent.""",1

"b'I really enjoy Lost Highway and have waited years for this 2008 DVD release. I have avoided buying the previous ""import"" version because of the explicit consumer complaints about the quality of the transfer. My potential concerns about the quality of the sound and the image have been dispelled when viewing this new American version. It looks and sounds pretty good, keeping in mind the source material. The visual style of the film is rare, simple and highly contrasted, rendered with the aesthetic of Lynch\'s ""vague America"". The image retains its integrity and the deep blacks employed do not suffer from the noise often observed during older or poorer transfers; the colors are also solid for a DVD. The sound design is appropriately moody, ambient, dark, evocative, provocative and mixes a rather eclectic mix of songs with the invaluable contributions of the composer Angelo Badalamenti. There may be a slightly irritating volume difference between Patricia Arquette\'s almost murmur and, let\'s say, Rammstein - but that\'s not a rare problem with DVDs. Otherwise, it looks pretty cool. I will not review the film, but I will say that the total absence of special features is more than forgivable for such an unusual, ambiguous and artistic film as Lost Highway. now . I tend to see this film as I see abstract art: the explanation is not only unjustified but also largely undesirable. In other words, special features might be intriguing, but I barely miss them for a movie like Lost Highway.'",1
"b""It's a good movie . I saw him at the theater and I knew that I should have the DVD.

"b""I'll admit it, the beginning of the movie was pretty good. I was interested, the game was good, and so far, the script was pretty good. But after a while, the movie became completely predictable and the script became horrible. Whatever the beginning of a plot, the writers had soon gone down and the end was completely ridiculous. The film was not satisfactory anyway; it left me with an incomplete feeling. The only thing that was up, in my opinion, was acting. The actors did a great job with the not so great script they got. My advice is to save your money and buy another movie (or rent or whatever if you see it).""",0

"b'The Golden Army - an army made to keep humanity in check because humanity has a problem with the consumption of everything around it. From Elvish thought and goblin design, he has the power to do things that only the desperate - or the crazy - would want. The Elven kind understands it, divides their toy and lets the army rust. Unfortunately for humanity, rust is an arbitrary word and the Golden Army is never a threat. And when powerplay begins to emerge, BPRDs are the only ones who have the skills to stop it. When I heard the source material of the film, I knew that the director / Migola knew what they were doing BUT it scared me a little. I say that because Hellboy II was creatively based on a novelty between Christopher Golden and Mike Mignola and does not really reflect Hellboy. There was a good idea and good creature characteristics, but in the end, the book was a slight disappointment. Fast forward to the book and you saw what a good director could do with something that needed a golden touch (forgive yourself). Toothpastes, Wink, the elemental, the goblin, the angel (if you want to understand this little beast and what it says more, take a look at the background of Anung A Rama and the way the beast was created history and highlights beautiful little things that a person should see on their own to truly understand everything) and all the characters in between. Fortunately, the casting has always been good, the direction is fabulous and Hellboy is described as Hellboy should be portrayed. It means that he thinks with his fist, that he is about the size of a little man and that he is not really full. a little thing called respect. Regarding what the film offered, let me just say that he had a bit of everything. The action was pretty good, the human elements (and I use the human more broadly) were fantastic, and the movie explored more what the BRPD is. They allowed viewers to shoot in each person, in their tastes and desires, and they added a new character who was oddly translating from book to film but still well translated as a character. Ron is a perfect Hellboy too, and he lets show this new album. In the part with the elemental, you can see how much it is impacted and in the fights with specific beings, you can say that he does not want to hurt them. He wants to be loved by all and understands the fate of things that ""threaten"" humanity. Del Toro added that it was one of the incredible things because it\'s one of Hellboy\'s things in the books - enough for the BPRD and he really have major problems. If you like Hellboy and want a movie on the subject, it\'s good work. I know there have been a lot of complaints here and there about certain aspects of the film, but Hellboy is a solid follow up and the fans of the novels / the first movie will have fun. If you pay close attention to details, you\'ll find all sorts of good things hidden in the background, which will allow you to take a look at what Anung Un Rama is doing as a human- demon by his own choices. You can also see potential elements that could have ramifications for the world and for all who live there - I enjoyed it too. Combine that with MUCH extra (we even get a cartoon that moves to keep ADD observers in us), and you have a second help that explores what the first movie could only build.'",1
"b""I thought I had found a jewel ... A DVD that covered the performance of one of the pioneers of metal ... the first years of one of the largest groups. Um no. Someone deliberately throws a deception on the Deep Purple DVDs that seem to suggest that you will get live performances, but all you really have are a lot of strangers who remember the band. have a terrible A / V quality. My expectations have never been high for A / V based on when they were recorded. But the big problem is that there is a lot of performance. These Critical Review series are DVDs of interviews with groups of people who might be familiar with the group. And with the performances (mostly shots taken) you get, you start screaming on TV to show the dang performers; the clips show things like the audience, the moon or the sky while the band is playing. The price of this outlet is a joke for the garbage content you get. This piece of shit is not even worth 1 dollar in my opinion for the relatively uninteresting Deep Purple items you get throughout the series. Purple Violet fans are not fooled. Go with Live In Concert 72/73 (but unfortunately mostly in black and white) and / or Live in California '74 if you liked the Coverdale / Burn years. But above all, stay away from the Add to Cart button here.""",0

"b""I must first say this. If you're expecting a story or a hero like Spider-Man, you'll be shocked. Daredevil's director's cut is one of the best cuts I've ever seen. Not only does the plot have more substance with the addition of deleted scenes, but it also links the holes of the plot. There was also a whole plot about blind lawyer Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) and Foggy Nelson (Jon Faverou) defending what looks like a guilty client, played by rapper Coolio of the '90s. In this cut you see more Matt Murdock, and you can See why Mark Steven Johnson chose Affleck to play blind vigilance. The first time I saw the original version, I thought Affleck was fine. But after that, I can say that Affleck was the perfect choice for Daredevil / Matt Murdock. But I must say that Collin Farrell as Bullseye steals the show. Not only did he play tea with him, but he also made Bullseye a more interesting character than in the comedy series. 13 notes that the original version a. Expect more scenes of graphic fights, and many more character swearing. In general, I must say that this cup really does justice to fans of comics. If you do not have it in your collection, buy it.

"b'Whenever a film is turned towards ""realism"", it usually opens the door to a predictable set of signifiers: portable cameras, real locations, natural lighting system, urban dialogue and tortured theatrical methods. In only two feature films, Funny Ha Ha and the new Mutual Recognition, writer and director Andrew Bujalski reconfigured the language into something much closer to reality. His aesthetic and semi-improvised dialogue has earned him frequent comparisons with John Cassavetes, but he does not care so much about acute emotion; the characters in his films are awkward and inexpressive to the point where they can not say how they feel, at least not without having to look for it first. Mutual appreciation is no more than a refinement of Funny Ha Ha, who follows a similar group of disordered girls as they struggle with relationship problems and try to give life to their lives. And yet, it\'s just as strange to watch, because Bujalski\'s stylized dialogue mark really sounds at full speed. The charismatic Justin Rice is a musician who moves to New York just after the separation puts him in a strange place because he has to play later in the week. Once in town, Rice returns with her friend Bujalski, a graduate student, and Bujalski\'s girlfriend, Rachel Clift. Meanwhile, Rice finds a champion and more in attractive university radio DJ Seung-min Lee, but runs into trouble when he brings Lee\'s brother as drummer and tries to get away from him a little. Rice and Clift meet, and a serious break in their relationship with Bujalski, but nothing in Mutual Appreciation goes according to the usual scenario. The scene in which Rice and Clift finally express their feelings for each other is the perfect example of what Bujalski does so well. you betray both of them What ends up happening between them is completely unexpected, but quite true for who they are and how most caring people would act. But such things rarely happen on screen, and Bujalski\'s willingness to follow him makes him a singular talent.'",1

"b'God this movie was really messy during all its duration. As the atmospheric films go well, this one is certainly a masterpiece. It is rather cold in the mood and strange atmosphere rather than friction and sudden violence. The film takes place in an old Jersey house shortly after the Second World War. Kidman Nicole embodies the owner of the house, living with her two children while waiting for her husband to come back from the war. At the beginning of the movie three servants arrive for give help.These remain the only characters who have really invested in the film.Nicole Kidman is excellent in the role, as are the two young children.Children suffer from a rare disease where they can not This causes dark scenes where the film is almost entirely placed in candlelight. To prevent children from being exposed to lights, all doors in each room must be locked and unlocked when entry. the film is spent with the openness and panic loss of these rooms, as there is a strange presence in the house. In many ways, some of these scenes are reminiscent of scenes from The Sixth Sense. the actors are beginning to reveal themselves too. This gives the film an incredibly intriguing feeling, which has made me feel comfortable all the way through. You never seem sure where this whole story leads. When they leave the house, the outside is covered with this almost surreal fog, creating a beautiful atmosphere again. It reminded me of those Basil Rathbone films Sherlock Holmes that gave me goosebumps when I was a kid. the sun will come out, if only to temporarily lift the atmosphere, to give the viewer a little respite. The rhythm accumulates as the film comes to a very, very dramatic conclusion. Beautifully shot, really gothic, brilliantly played and worth seeing.'",1

"b'Just upstairs, with ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" and ""There\'s Something About Mary,"" there\'s my favorite Billy Murray comedy. `` Goundhog Day \'\'. Murray (as TV Weatherman Phil Connors) is easily the only Hollywood star in the film, as the rest of the cast is far less well known in the field. Andie MacDowell was probably better known for her modeling career in 1993 than as an actress ... she does a great job as a producer of ""Rita"". Chris Elliot did a great job in a less boring role than he was under the name of ""Larry"", the cameraman (he has evolved a lot since ""The Man Under The Stairs"" on David Letterman). The other actor who really makes an impression is the man with the recognizable face, but what is his name (Stephen Tobolowsky as life insurance salesman Ned `` Bing! \'\' Ryerson). Oh, and scooter the groundhog. As for the story, Bill Murray is stuck in the same cold day (which happens to be Groundhog Day) in Punxsutawney, PA, covering the now famous festivities. He continues to live the same day again and again. Every day he sees the same things. Every day he meets the same people ... the man in the corridor early in the morning, Doris the waitress, the mayor of the city, etc. He decides to make the most of the situation and does whatever he wants ... only because he knows he will wake up the next day and it will be the same day again. As he is tired of reliving the same day again and again, Connors is focusing on Rita. First, try to impress him. Then, trying to really take care of her. When it finally reaches it, the spell is broken and the next day appears. I classify some of Bill Murray\'s films as classic ... ""Caddyshack"", ""Stripes"", ""Scrooged"", ""What About Bob"", etc., but I put ""Groundhog Day"" at the top of the list. Easy choice for my favorite movie Bill Murray.

Lucy calls the president & quot; who reunited with many of his costars like Gale Gordon and Vivian Vance. I think that as fans, we need to let companies that own the rights to these shows know that there is a demand for them and send them the simple message ""It\'s time to open the coffers!""'",1

For those of you who want the best of the Masterpiece Theater approach, with Susan Hampshire and an exceptional cast, the most magnificent music you've ever heard, a story that will keep you glued to the screen, you will NOT be disappointed. The two best series ever published by the BBC are The Foryste Saga and The Pallisers. Enjoy !""",1
"b'Watch `` The fragrance of green papaya? is like listening to a harmonious song. There is not much dialogue in this film but you will not feel bored. I appreciate the quiet, elegant and graceful mood of the film. He uses many simple melodies and close-ups in the film to reflect the mood of the characters. The visual and auditory beauty brings you comfort when you look at it. The first part of the film takes place in 1951, it is at that time that the French authority has almost ended. The French occupied Vietnam for more than 30 years before 1954. During the French administration, the Vietnamese had been influenced by the French. In the first half of the film, Mui lived in a traditional family of children. The grandmother lost her husband while she was still a teenager and she insisted on praying every morning for her husband and remaining faithful to her. The father left the house with another woman and took all the money a few times, but the mother never resented him. Instead, the grandmother blamed him for not knowing how to please his own husband. In the second half of the film, Mui moved to a musician as a servant. The musician, who is also his master, named Khuyen, was influenced by the French and knows how to play the piano. His house has been decorated in a French style, colorful and bright. Unlike the previous family, simple, antique and all in wood. Khuyen was engaged but later discovered that Mui was very attractive after getting dressed. He fell for her and after he broke up with her fiance? and married Mui. This film shows the difference between a traditional Vietnamese family and a modern Westernized family. Not only the living environment has great differences, but also the perception of relationships.'",1

This movie was so well done, with a particular attention to detail that I was blown away (in a good way). After watching the ""extras"", again, I was blown away by the tremendous amount of work needed to make one of those action-stop movies ... it\'s amazing. The story and the situations have become spooky ... (button eyes) and can be a bit intense for young children. For ""mature"" viewers ... whether you\'re watching the 3D version or the ""normal"" version, I think you\'ll have a pleasant surprise.3D Performance: The 3D was ""stellar"" on this disc. As good or better than at the theater. Most 3D Blu-ray Discs have a problem with ""Convergence"", better explained as ""Ghost Stereo"" to objects in the background. It can be as low as 2% up to about 20%. This film was absolutely perfect. This is the record I am now using for my ""gold master"" of 3D perfection.

"b""With better direction and better play, I think * Foxy Brown * could have been a great movie. As things stand now, it's pretty much a decent plot filled with distractions from a parade of terrible acts and outrageous fashion from the '70s (the latter, however, is really reason enough to see the movie Pame Grier, Despite her great impertinent attitude and confidence on the screen, she seems plagued by a terrible delivery of her lines. (Fortunately, Grier's inability to deliver is eclipsed by the terrible action of Katheryn Loder, which could have given one of the worst performances I've ever seen by an actress. seems particularly talented, the best being Juanita Brown as callgirl Claudia and Antonio Fargas as the perfectly incompetent brother of Foxy, the perpetrator.It's still a decent film, but maybe not the one you want on your list. If fashion does not appeal to you, it's worth it to see Grier's amazing action scenes and the often laughable and seemingly endless amount of random sex situations. 70s, Pam Grier or Blaxploitation is a must, otherwise rent it if you like violence and do not find Tarantino movies.""",0
"b'I was so excited when I heard that Confession of a Shopaholic was going to be a movie because I love books. Yes, the books are incredibly stupid, but I still think they are cute and funny. I missed the film in theaters and I forgot it until I went through my lists on demand tonight (yes, 2 years later)!). I knew from the trailer / movie commercials that it was going to be different (ie Becky & co being American, NY-based, etc.), but wow, I had no idea of the difference of the film. I feel that the differences really ruined the film. In the film, Luke is a total schlub, works for a magazine, and there is all that fashion magazine. None of this happens in the books, and Suzy and Tarkie get married later. It was a total shipwreck. Indulge yourself and read the books instead!'",0

"b'Welcome to The Rileys attracted me more and more as the film progressed; At first I thought it was a little slow, but when the pace accelerated with the backdrop of New Orleans, I was rather impressed by what he had to say. The casting could not have been better; Melissa Leo gives a remarkable performance as a guilty homemaker and punishes herself for a car accident that took her daughter\'s life a long time ago; and James Gandolfini performs a masterful performance as her husband Doug who simply can not override his grief and personal demons. Choreography and cinematography enhance the film and the musical score does an excellent job of making the film even better. Lois Riley (Melissa Leo) and her husband Doug (James Gandolfini) are still very upset even though it\'s been eight years since their daughter died in a car accident. Lois has not left home since the car accident; Indeed, Lois was so depressed that she already has gravestones for her and Doug next to the grave of their deceased daughter, a fact that gives goosebumps to Doug. Doug also has a long relationship with a waitress named Vivian (Eisa Davis). However, when Vivian suddenly dies of a heart attack, Doug is very upset and always sadder. and he suffers in silence because he does not know that Lois knew about him and Vivian for quite some time now. and still be upset by Vivian\'s death (he had wanted to take him on his birthday) and feel out of place in a very different city from where he lives with his wife, Doug leaves the convention one day and walks around a strip strip where he meets a minor call girl who has several different names, including Mallory (Kristen Stewart of ""Twilight"" fame). Doug and Mallory begin an unconventional relationship; she reminds Doug of her daughter. So what does Doug do? He phones Lois to tell him that he stays in New Orleans indefinitely without giving any reason to Lois; He moves in with Mallory, paying him $ 100 a day to stay with her in his very dilapidated apartment in an abandoned house after Hurricane Katrina and Doug try desperately to grow Mallory with a combination of love and confrontation that Mallory has need. Meanwhile, Lois decides to finally leave their home after nearly eight years of indoors - she is determined to drive to New Orleans and find Doug there by calling her on her cellphone. Of course, the rest of what is happening gives us a very solid story and good entertainment. I could tell you more; but there will be no spoilers here even if it may seem to have already told you too much! Suffice it to say that the rest of the plot should hold your attention. In addition, Tiffany Coty, Tara and Lance E. Nichols, will perform very well in a very brief appearance as Hamilton \'Ham\' Watkins, another convention businessman. the film.I recommend this film for anyone interested in dramatic family drama or theater in general; and of course the fans of the actors of this film would do well to add that to their collections.'",1
"b""One Body Too Many, a 1944 black and white film, is not particularly good. BUT, it's a funny movie. It's an idiotic horror / comedy type B movie that has become the meat and potatoes of many early studios. I like this . Jack Haley is Albert Tuttle a nose for the grindstone insurance man who has an appointment with a rich old recluse. He arrives in his mansion and is seen by the butler (Bela Lugosi). He is shown in his clients' office and immediately starts his spiel in the back of a chair and smoke from a lit cigar. However, unbeknownst to Tuttle, the client is dead and in his coffin at the office. Tuttle puts his case on the closed coffin before realizing what's in the room. When he tries to go out, he can not open the door, etc. This film is filled with all imaginable clich\xc3\xa9s. But that's the fun of it. A huge scary and dark house, a willingness to read, a butler and a cook looking suspicious, a beautiful young lady in distress, a smart detective, a family of members of the deceased, murders, doors, screams and noises at night, etc. Of course, a very nervous and reluctant hero. That kind of movie would be nothing without Lyle Talbot and he's here as a family member who thinks Tim Haley has something to hide. I've had this movie for years and from time to time I dust it for look at it again because sometimes you need some harmless pleasure. (~. ~)""",0

"b""Was JK bothered by this mistake? Egad was really a disappointment, and the illusion that it was good cinema, or five stars is only on the trail of having Potter as a label. Even if Freddie Prinze Jr played Severus Snape, Potter fans around the world would give him praise. A poorly executed scenario, the CGI was a teenager, in a world now supported by the Transformers, you think they would have called Stan Wintson was having fun, it was really a first year of work at the New York Film Academy. The plot was cerebral. Rupert Grint is made of wood, plastic and insignificant. There was absolutely no character development on the part of jumpstreet, and also no suspense. We are convinced that because it's Harry Potter, it's going to be good. I'm a big fan of the book series and, of course, the books are usually better than the movies, but compared to the book, it was a real deluge. Personally, I find Branagh an actor of the superb method, he played a good Hamlet and his films are very thoughtful and distinctive, but the problem here is obvious, he was motionless and banal. the global sensation of Rowling epics? and like Augusten's Running With Scissors, respect the book.

"b'These are two episodes of Shirley Temple\'s Storybook drama series. IMDB lists the episodes of Babes in Toyland from 1960. It stars Angela Cartwright, Jonathan Winters, Joe Besser, Jerry Colonna and, of course, Shirley Temple. Compared to the Disney version of 61 or 62, it\'s a much smaller show. It\'s not as good as the 1930s version of Laurel and Hardy (aka March of the Wooden Soldiers). The main value of this DVD is an example of a simpler time, when television could get away with simplicity (think high school production values) sets, minimal writing and play, and call it entertainment. The scenario does not look like any version of Babes in Toyland I saw. The dancers seem to be implied, and the actors swallow shamelessly. Children actors must remember laughter at the antics and failures of adults. The segment Winnie the Pooh is a little better done with puppets Bill and Cora Baird who made the sequence ""Lonely Goatherd"" in Sound of Music. . It would be good for children to watch.'",0
"b""It was probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and that says a lot. This is never a good sign when the best actor in a movie comes from prostitutes hired to act, yes, you guessed it, prostitutes. Everyone seemed to just show up to win a pay check by putting on the costumes and playing with the blood geysers during the so-called action sequences. The only saving grace was the fact that it was so bad that you could not help but laugh and ask yourself, was Michael Madsen really drunk during the whole filming? If that's really true, it would largely explain how bad his performance was and if so, maybe the rest of the cast would join him quietly. so I can not really compare it to that, all I can say is that as an independent film, it was a waste of money.""",0

When an unexploded bomb left by World War II disappears, local merchant Stanley Holloway discovers an ancient treasure trove, including a mysterious document. An eccentric university professor (Margaret Rutherford) translates the document, and this proves that Miramont Place was the site of a palace given to the Duke of Burgundy in exile by King Edward IV, making the inhabitants of Miramont Square from Burgundy rather than of Great Britain.

I'm a big manga fan, so I thought I'd give the anime a shot. I was extremely shocked when I started to watch. This show is as good as the manga. It follows the plot of the story, with the addition / subtraction of certain points of the plot and another parcel of Ouran Fair. Each of the actors of the voice (in English and in Japanese) makes each character justice. The characters themselves are hilarious and diverse. The plot is entertaining. Do not let the pink blanket fool you; this show is not even girly / shojo-y. The fact that I actually bought the series says a lot, especially since I watched the series twice by a friend before buying it on Amazon (and I am super duper frugal).

"b'After all the hype about this movie, I was expecting something completely different. The documentary focused more on the White family and was barely focused on Jesco. With The Dancing Outlaw, Jesco was in the spotlight and seemed to be the worst of the family when it came to mental state, but in this one he seems to be the only sensible one. , hate, love or anything else, documentaries are made for that reason. This one was completely successful, but not the way I imagined it. I could not help but think how much this family is a shame for D Ray White and West Virginia. They openly boast of shooting people, killing people, selling drugs, beating prescriptions, and sniffing pills in front of their newborns (which CPS is taking away from them, thank God). It disgusted me, but that\'s what this documentary was supposed to do. I loved it, I\'m a big fan of Jesco White and I thought it was as good as The Dancing Outlaw. I just think that Dickhouse Pictures has somehow exploited this dysfunctional family in the name of ""Legacy"", which I suppose to be legitimate ... but not cool. I recommend it wholeheartedly, but it plays as a part of the \'Intervention\' episode COPS and part Gummo. Sometimes it seemed a bit wrong, but the fact that it shocked you for a second.

"b'CHARLOTTE SOMETIMES is a nocturnal film, a story that gently crosses the lives of four people and with very few words about human relations, the cocoons that we turn around us for security, protection against fear hope the chrysalis becomes a butterfly or butterfly. Eric Byler must be commended for having the courage to keep this story simple - a story of four ""personality disorders"" and how they find the way to exist in this strange world. Michael Idemoto may be the loneliest on the outside, but the four characters seem to crave the connection and just can not get on. Eugenia Yuan is the idiosyncratic girl, Jacquelyn Kim is the woman of mystery who, with Matt Westmore, plays more a catalytic agent than a character. The four actors are beautiful, sensitive and convincing. Lighting and settings are well chosen. In all, this small independent film is a discreet diversion, which deals more with what is not said than with a simple script.'",1

That's when golf professional Helen Hunt moves to town and is immediately excited about her. I love Robert Altman. He is a great storyteller, but something was missing in this film.

"b'I think that decades later, when film school students will study the history of American animation, the giant Iron may be the last great example of animated films drawn before the computer animation. This film tells the story of the fact that when it was first released in cinemas, its promotion was so underfunded and simply bad that it was not very successful. Fortunately, this video has been dedicated to DVDs and DVDs. This film is an example of what animation films do regularly in Japan, but rarely in the United States. It\'s well written, visually impressive and works for all ages, not just for kids. Be warned that this may not be suitable for very young children. The culminating battle sequence involves a potentially frightening transformation of the Iron Giant. Do not get me wrong, this movie is for everyone except the youngest viewers and * most * very young children can cope. But some children are more sensitive and nightmarish than others, so if you have children under 6, I advise you to watch them before watching them.

If you are an adult who has written animated movies as a ""kid thing"" because they tend to be banal and formal, you have to see that movie yourself. unable to give less than 5 stars, which is a shame, because it is a film that deserves to stand out and which earned him a rating of 5 stars.'",1

"b'After spying this series on the shelves of my local library and seeing it as a budding woman from 1900 to 1910 in London, I picked up all the volumes. This series really surprised me:. Louisa Trotter is a chef who works hard in the UK profession and society with a lot of elbow grease, an understanding of human nature and luck. Gemma Jones is excellent as Louisa Trotter and the cast is very solid. I did not know if this series was a mini-series or a television series (it\'s TV), but it\'s rather Dickensian the episode is based on the previous one. And I can not pay more for a series than to say that conflict resolution is neither trivial nor superficial. Many allusions to historically accurate events, politicians and contemporary culture are incorporated into the scenarios. I think I learned more about English classism and the social customs of the ""Duchess"" and Bentinck Hotel than of my semester in London. If you like theater (and comedy) and powerful heroines, then you\'ll love the Duchess of Duke Street. ""This series stands the test of time. My only complaint is that I have not learned much about the culinary arts, but the writing is so much above the norm that my complaint has become inconsequential. Although this series began to shoot in 1976, production values \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bmake it difficult to rank.

"b'This morning, I tore the retractable film with the joy of a six-year-old offender who had received a day pass at a Cadburys candy factory. I then sat down to watch it and emerged two hours later with the smile of a 51-year-old Cheshire cat on Viagra. We all know that ""The Italian Job"" is a 1960s classic, but what you do not know is that this 40th anniversary reissue (published on June 15, 2009 in the UK) is simply out of place ... First, print - which is GLORIOUS - as perfect as you might expect and a joy from start to finish. And although it does not show on the outer box, this is the fully restored version of the British Film Institute, which has been image-by-image cleansed (and these shots are used in the ""Making Of""). also ) . One of these features is the trailer for the 30th anniversary reissue of 10 years ago, which uses the famous ""van doors"" sequence. Untouched - it\'s covered in scratches and has no definition - it lets you see what the movie stock looked like compared to its beautiful appearance after the restoration. There are so many scenes coming out now - like Matt Monro \'The cheesy song\' On Days Like These \'is playing and the car is crossing the Alps in the credits - when Charlie gets out of jail as he walks through the gates and Maggie Blye l welcomes in a stolen car from the Pakistan Embassy - when the three Mini Coop climb on the roof of the football stadium with the Italian cops in pursuit - that\'s all BEAUTIFUL. The BFI has also produced ""Zulu"", ""The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner"" and ""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning"", which corresponds to the same standard (see my reviews). The extras are also generous (almost two hours): 1. Commentary with screenwriter Tony Kennedy Martin and writer Matthew Field2. Comment from producers Michael Deeley and Author Matthew Field3. Mini Adventures (in HD) 4. ""Self-Preserving Society: Get Rid of Italian Jobs"" (in HD) - introduces new interviews with actors, writers, producers, including Michel Caine, Maggie Blye , Troy Kennedy Martin, Michael Deeley, Noel Coward, director Peter Collinson, Quincy Jones on the nice score etc ... 5. Music Video (in HD) 6. The deleted scene with commentary by the author Matthew Field7. Theatrical Trailer8. Re-release TrailerThe cast was of course a mix of luck, fate and genius - Caine perfect as Charlie Croker the likely guy, Benny Hill as computer boffin, the suave but deadly Raf Vallone as boss of the Mafia and Tony Beckley as Camp Freddy, dressed dandily. But the biggest blow of all was Noel Coward as Mr. Bridger - the master criminal doing his time in Her Majesty\'s Prison Service. He has tea and scones, worries about the British economy and sees his cell covered with photos of the queen. Coward is simply priceless as he talks about the ""Rule Britannia"" prison cover, played behind him by a string quartet - that\'s enough to make you scream with laughter ... You see, you forget how much The Italian Job is the catty gay tailor who says that Charlie\'s pre-owned clothes could now be part of a museum exhibit, with Coward standing next to two prison guards as they handed him his two newspapers and one roll of toilet paper. The astonishment of prison governor John Le Mesurier, while Coward complains, is that ""his"" toilet was invaded by Michael Caine (throwing him a burglary) - the toilet of a man is his castle ... John Clive has the money Michael Caine has given him to take care of his Aston Martin DB - he has been in his garage for two years while Caine was in India. ""I was shooting at old tigers ..."" The owner of the garage counted fifty, ""... there must have been a lot of tigers sir ..."" The places in Turin are wonderfully colorful, the mountain scenes as crisp like James Bond reissues and Caine\'s freckles clearer than ever - all that - what a peach! I saw a lot of old movies in the new BLU RAY format - some were successful, some were lamentable - but they are the best. In fact, as a man who loves the medium and believes in its possibilities, I suspect that it will tickle pink Michael Caine that his films ""Zulu"" and ""The Italian Job"" both contribute to the creation of BLU. RAY as ""the"" format to restore old movies and keep them properly. Forward for David Lean\'s boys ... As you can tell - and if you forgive the pun - I was blown away. I loved it, loved it, loved it.

The beautiful score of Lerner & Loewe includes songs such as ""I Remember It Well"", ""The Night They Invented Champagne"", ""Thank Heaven For Little Girls"", as well as the title track. ""Gigi"", sings with a surprising candor and serious by Louis Jourdan. The three directors, Leslie Caron, Louis Jourdan and Maurice Chevalier, as well as Paris locals, contribute to maintaining a distinct French flavor, particularly in the way the characters are linked and interact. For all those who commented on the politically inaccurate nature of history, a closer look will reveal the true feminist perspective of Colette\'s revolutionary work for the time: 1) History is a commentary on social and economic options. limited economic opportunities of women outside marriage (or prostitution elsewhere) at the turn of the century, 2) Although Gigi (Caron) never completely master her lessons and grooming, she can capture the heart of Gaston (Jourdan ) precisely because of its imperfections and 3) the most important is Gaston rather than Gigi who is forced to really transform and challenge the social conventions of the time to bring history to its resolution. Compare that to My Fair Lady, who offers a similar social comment but resolves in a more standardized way; although Professor Higgins finally realizes his love for Eliza in the end, it is Eliza who is forced to submit her will by making a reconciliation that solves none of the issues raised in the scenes that preceded this point.

"b""The Limey is probably the best job of Soderbergh, it is better Traffic and Erin Brockovich easily, only Out of Sight and Sex, Lies and Videotape are close. The Limey is one of the only films I have seen where the film's stylistic possibilities make the film not only a lenient work of art to debate in the film class, but a poignant film that resonates and stays with you. Terence Stamp embodies Wilson's main character as a sad and tough English criminal trying to find out what happened to his daughter. His quest is based on genre, but this film exceeds any genre label. Great merit should go to Lem Dobbs's script that avoids the clich\xc3\xa9 and injects an interesting comedy. But the editing style of this movie is why I love it, it works in the waves as in the memories, it's the only movie I've seen that shows precisely how your mind can go from 'one thing to another. Pretty much right away, I look like an art student who caresses the chin and jumped on his own importance. But watch the movie and you'll see what I mean. The best part of this movie is that it's sad, that the end is not a huge twist or a drift, it's just deeply sad, and there are not many movies that evoke that feeling in me today. I'm finished .""",1

"b""Femme Fatale is Brian De Palma's film noir about a woman (Rebecca Romijin-Stamos), who makes bad choices by taking an innocent (Antonio Banderas) to his site. It has the iconic De Palma signature - eroticism, intelligent cinematography and a film that moves only by pure style - but in the end you will feel empty and, unfortunately, short-term for the time you have invested The film begins with a spectacular and unlikely burglary at the Cannes Film Festival in 2001, during which Rebecca and her team strive to relieve an almost naked actress of her few body protections: a gold and diamond serpentine bodice and accessories . Although visually and musically interesting, the opening scene requires many oversights on the part of the viewer - for example, ignoring the fact that a large part of the project, despite its Mission Impossible style configuration, relies on guards who search poorly. irresistible. Things go wrong and in the end, Rebecca doubles her team, gets rid of the goods and seeks another life. She finds one in a couple looking for their runaway girl, which Rebecca is so discreet for this woman. s own parents can not tell the difference.

Life is beautiful until the paparazzi photographer Antonio Banderas takes his elusive photo, announcing his presence to the two villains. From there, Rebecca looks for the exit-left lane that brings her the most money at any cost. The story plays like a checklist of eroticism - there is voyeurism, a striptease, sad at the Cannes Film Festival. Brian De Palma does it all with style - split-screen, breathtaking angles - and it's fun to watch him in action - but that's still not enough to fill the gaps in the story. film themes in a good money, but will leave you betrayed. Despite the power of star, I did not appreciate Femme Fatale. Granted, Rebecca was not blue - fans of her X-Men role will not be disappointed. The character of Antonio Banderas presented one or two interesting scenes, but most of the time, they were mistaken in doing everything that was manipulated, without original solution. Seeing it happen with a smart breakaway would have been a much better end - but, instead, the end rested on an exaggerated trick to get out of its sad final.Pass on Femme Fatale - even if you're looking to see Rebecca in a light non-X-Men. In spite of all the pomp, it's just not worth the investment.""",0
"b'Synopsis: John Ritter plays Roy Knable, a real couch potato whose life and marriage disintegrates around his ears as he watches TV to escape all that. The same evening his wife Helen (Pam Dawber) plans to leave, a mysterious salesman named Spike (Jeffrey Jones) seems to be selling a new TV to Roy, with a gigantic satellite dish that will transmit 666 channels directly into Roy\'s living room. Yet, something goes wrong when Roy and his wife are sucked into the satellite dish and enter the hellish world of Satan TV. From there, it is urgent to survive before the time is up. About the film: Stay Tuned is probably one of my favorite comic films. I saw it for the first time in the early 90s and when I saw that it was released on DVD, I jumped on the opportunity to get it. Stay Tuned is filled with humor and slapstick, a lot of very twisted plays on classic TV. s and TV shows. Among them are Saturday Night Live, Star Trek Next Generation, Three \'s Company, WWF and classic cartoons. The comic is presented in a wonderfully delightful animated sequence that was supervised in production by legendary animator Chuck Jones (who did a lot of cartoons of Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck). The comical timing of Ritter helps to make this film. Although this film has never been much noticed, it is certainly an excellent example of John Ritter\'s comic career that lasted more than two decades. Eugene Levy (""SCTV"" and ""American Pie"") also plays a major role in this film as Crowley, a Hell TV Exec who helps the Knables on their journey. He managed to play the adorable slimeball in a fun way. Jeffrey Jones plays the villain, the CEO of Hell TV, Spike. He is an excellent actor for the villain in a comedy, and he manages to be convincing and funny at the same time without rendering the role stupid, as happens to the bad guys in fashionable comedies these days. With John Ritter \'As the timing is comical and Pam Dawber plays the role of playmaker from the mad channel to the demented channel, this movie is great for a lot of laughs. About the DVD: Stay Tuned comes in a cardboard DVD case. It is presented in widescreen format with Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. Both the image and the sound are pretty good. I did not notice any problem with either. The DVD is translated into French (why not Spanish?) And contains subtitles in English, French and Spanish.For special features, the DVD includes a trailer, info on the distribution and a preview of the film . The distribution information is simply a list of actors in the movie. They do not even provide bios for them, making it a clear case of building content with minimal effort. The featurette is the guy they used to show on TV just before the release of the movie, with interviews of actors who are not at all enlightening if you saw the movie. This is only slightly interesting. The bad news is that the music playing behind the commentator is downright annoying in the first quarter. This DVD release is a pretty good standard. An awesome movie about a standard version of DVD. 4 stars'",1

"b'If I did not say it before I say it again, I\'m a big fan of George A. Romero\'s Night Of The Living Dead and its aftermaths over the last forty years. Thanks to him, we really know the horrible world of Zombies and undead precisely and know how much it can be trapped, whether it\'s an old farm, a suburban mall, an underground bunker or elsewhere. an attack by the pork butchers of the living. Of course, once you\'ve created such a popular character in Horror, you get a dumb copy trying to take advantage of your original creation. Curiously, most of these types of films have had various successes, including the Italian Zombi filmmakers of the 1980s. Unfortunately, the one that triggered everything, that of 1968, due to a copyright snafu, has never had this right and it soon became clear that everyone could publish it, possess it and / or make any version of it. the plot and the title as they wish.But first, a little history: in 1998, Anchor Bay and John A. Russo (one of the men who contributed to the creation of the original \'Romero \') decided to release a version of the 30th anniversary, but instead of simply republishing the same print as all the other DVD makers, he shot and added new images with the old one, creating a new plot that is hurting only to the original film, but betrays the social commentary that was inscribed on it. the first place . A real misstep and the fans were not happy. However, when it came to finishing the remakes, at least someone had understood before that. In 1990, with the personal advice of Romero and the special effects genius Tom Savini at the helm, they realized a Night Of The Living Dead that stayed close to the original screenplay, giving these 90-year-old audiences not only a pride, but better in some aspects of gore and production values. So, after a good remake and a learning error in what not to do with a classic, could it be redone? Apparently not . In 2006, with director Jeff `` Corman Wanna-Be \'\' Broadstreet under the presidency, they decided to try again, of course without the consent of Romero, but this time with a twist: let\'s try to do in 3D! 3D? Really ? This seems like a curious idea, but it really falls flat here. Being blunt NOTLD3D is a travesty. Filmed in a non-existent budget, it must be the worst ""reimagination"" of a movie since the 2001 Planet Of The Apes. Of course, most of your favorite characters are here, but this time, mixed and interpreted by actors who are so stiff, it is difficult to distinguish them from real zombies. And the story is so slow and boring that it seems like a 3 hour vision of something you expect to see on Sci-Fi Channel. Moreover, while the gore factor of the 1968 original was at best minimal, 36 years later, we still do not see much, if at all, but for financial reasons, and at mid-term, I wondered why was it noted ""R"" in the first place. These are new intrigues, the sets are boring, and the appearance of Sid Haig, who has just been crowned by the icon of Horror (which in my opinion is not the biggest deal), is totally useless. Establishing that it was the pinnacle of selling movies. The main attraction is 3D, is not it? False. Instead of using the latest stereoscopic 3D technology (ie with ""shades of gray""), they opted for the obsolete anaglyphic type (red / blue) that turns the entire film into a purple salvo. And do not expect anything for you to ""jump"". When it works, and it\'s rare, it only gives the depth of the backgrounds, which means your picture looks deeper, no closer. It should also be noted that apart from the backstage features, this entire disc is in 3D, which means that without the glasses, it is impossible to grasp it. There is no 2D version on the disc included as it should have been (this version is released separately), so once these glasses are there, it\'s the ultimate coaster. In short, bad movie, bad 3D, bad idea. It had already been redone in 1990 and eight years later, it had already received a gimmick that did not work either. Even as a movie alone, a flix like Day Of The Dead 2: Contagium is a better movie. Hard to suggest, even if you are a completeist like me, NOTLD3D is a dead film that should remain buried.

"b'First, I highly recommend the review below, by the guy named `` Sideburns \'\'. ""I think it captures the factual basis and the spirit of this film. I can understand how some ""Australia-philes"" might want to see a purely Australian product, and that\'s not it. It\'s not ""Smash Palace"" or many other beautiful Australian films like this. What this film is, can be described in one word: WEIRD.It\'s a good thing. The genius of Eric Roberts was (and perhaps still), his ability to get lost in his roles lacks self-awareness about how he presents himself. To see this movie and see other excellent (and strange) movies, including ""The Greenwich Village Pope"" and ""Runaway Train"", you have to see a pretty amazing career arc. He seemed to embark on serious films with major talents around him, and then be able to perform demanding roles (albeit some similar ones, of course), with energy and control. Okay, on this film. First of all, let \'s be honest, this is not a deep film. It\'s not supposed to be. It\'s like an independent film from a Farrely brothers movie, at least their first movies, where they\'re not afraid to take risks and have fun. There is also a nice romantic subtext that they had (""Kingpin"" - believe it or not, ""Me, myself and Irene"") where, in a ridiculous way, they reflect what is happening in a large majority of people who are either looking for love, or looking for something in themselves, and who find it reflected or - in the case of the main characters in Farrely\'s films, and certainly in ""Coca Cola Kid "". I\'m not saying that Woody Harrelson or Jim Carrey could have been the Coca Cola Kid, but what they all have in common, in the specific roles they\'ve played in these movies, is to ask if anyone could or could find something at a distance. interesting about them in a romantic way. They are so completely indomitable, they seem almost caricatured - and we only think about a lot of people we all know, and it\'s not so elusive. The music alone in the movie is just fantastic. The character commands in Coca Cola\'s jingle are incredible, and they\'re punctuated by this aboriginal man playing his device - a guy Roberts discovers outside of Coca Cola\'s local offices, and gets up and running quickly. It\'s really funny to see The Kid\'s mental work - marketing the wheels like a pin when designing and using his strategies. We also make fun of everyone on both sides, which makes it a very good film, largely uncritical (rare these days, huh?). There are other interesting little touches in the soundtrack, and I am careless. , if I avoided the beautiful scene Greta Scaatchi where she refreshes ... go see the movie! It\'s weird, it\'s revealing and fun. He\'s also doing a great job in discussing cultural conflicts, where, when everyone is harmless, you can see how the progress is the result of some dissension, but we still wonder if we are losing a bit in translation. If it \'s vague, the film is in a way, and I think that is exactly what the director wanted to do. Not everything has to fit perfectly. Many do not, and this seems a little real.'",1

"b'Let me start by saying that I am not a beginner. So, I can tell you with certainty that this is not for beginners. Yes, I shout :) However, if you are a beginner, you can still use it if you pay close attention to what I am going to tell you. Women in particular do not use a weight or weight of 2 to 3 pounds for the set. Train yourself the first time you complete it. NOT MORE THAN 3 BOOKS YOUR FIRST TIME! ! ! If you worked before, no more than 5 books! ! ! Watch out for swimming and butterfly movements. I think it is better to use NO weight for these 2 shots at the beginning. I recommend the above because most movements are done at high speed, whether you have already worked or not, some movements are too fast to keep a good shape. for a beginner. In addition, excessive pressure on the shoulders could put your neck to the test. After the first time you make this DVD, you can determine the weight you need and if you want to disable some exercises, it\'s a good idea. The trainer is a bit boring because he continues to call him a ""beginner"". to do exercises. This is very irritating because it is NOT technically a workout for beginners. Apart from that, it can be a good workout for someone who has worked before and will slow down some movements and practice good form. It\'s hard to know how to do it if you\'ve never worked before. It\'s clear that ""beginner"" does not necessarily mean it\'s your first workout, but it could be for some. And remember, coach BOB insists that this is your first workout for beginners, so apparently, he thinks a first timer can do it. With that, he should have advised the use of very very light weights and have a modifier. I gave 2 stars to this DVD because it is in 2012 and there should be several options in the menu to show the changes and a little more explanation. In summary, a beginner can do it, but does NOT use more than 3 books the first time. And do not be discouraged if you can not do everything. Most beginners will not be able to do the whole thing the first time. Perhaps the BOB trainer should change the name to beggars, because it will be intimidating for most beginners and many of them will probably be hurt if they do not know how to master and use the right person. technical.'",0

"b'It\'s my fault that I was expecting more from this movie, but I guess this movie was not made for guys like me. The acting is good, the character of Matthew McConaughey, Ben and Kate Hudson, Andie, must act and react. Dialogue does not matter. The character of Kate Hudson still has the upper hand, which is good for a moment, but after an hour, it becomes tiring. She completely invades every aspect of Ben\'s life; we do not even see Andie\'s world apart from her two friends and her workplace. So, although the two characters have a similar program, there is a complete imbalance between the superiority, and this represents for me the biggest gap in the film. He supports all his attempts to ""lose"" it, but all this only produces frustration for Andie - and helps him do more crazy things. As a spectator, you\'re dying to see her fall once on her face. But it is wishful thinking. Ben \'s resilience to Andie\' s antics just distracted me and Andie \'s total lack of shame did not please me. Of course, they both look great, and Hudson shines positively when she smiles, but the man, 112 minutes, is long to endure this game. I can imagine that some people think this movie is awesome. Girl Power and everything. I do not know . But I think we can agree that the film was designed as a vehicle for the rise of Kate Hudson. This film reminds me a bit of WHAT WOMEN WANT (with Mel Gibson) for a variety of reasons, but mostly because it was written and produced by women - which, in the world of male-dominated cinema, is an indispensable prospect - but Nancy Myers producer / director of What Women\'s Want) is significantly smarter than the ""brains"" of How To Lose A Guy in 10 days. Just watch additional DVDs to see the evidence. We meet two of the producers, both of whom have obviously had facelifts. I\'m serious . It\'s scary. They talk about matter like Shakespeare\'s. Then there\'s director Donald Petrie, who has absolutely no charisma. The MAKING OF with it is so cheap that it\'s probably funnier to watch than most movies. While seated to chat, a television screen behind him triggers images of the film, and an office worker (back to the camera) stares at a static screen while biting his fingernails and shaking his head. She does this for the duration of the interviews with Petrie. Oh, and did I mention the background music that accompanies the extras? It\'s the music of department stores. Or elevator music. Whichever one you hate more. I did not care about the comment. Donald is an enemy. There is no release, which is now unusual for a comedy. The deleted scenes are actually good, honest emotions are shown by Andie and we have some quieter private moments between the two tracks. Look, it started ok. It looked like it would be a soft and harmless romantic comedy, but the romance lasted about 10 minutes. I can summarize my comment with this observation of why the director Petrie was interested in making the film. He says it was because he discovered that Kate Hudson was attached to it. Aha. So, basically, if the film is doing well at the box office, then it will launch Hudson and his career. Sorry Petrie, but that\'s not enough for me.'",0
"b'A beautiful young woman suspects that her astronaut husband could have been radically changed by an astronaut in flight. His partner has a suicidal tendency, as does his partner\'s wife. She learns that she is pregnant and that the stakes are increasing. In the end, a desperate ex-CIA man has a hard time giving him up. Will he do it? Is she going? There is suspense in this suspense / science fiction movie; unfortunately, it\'s involuntary. This is to ask when the film will become suspensive. We know everything from the start. We know what the husband\'s secret is and we know that his wife will eventually find out. The only possible advantage is that the director does what happens, when Theron\'s character ends up understanding it, interesting. Unfortunately, she undoubtedly discovers about an hour and a half in a film of just two hours. How might the rest be interesting? You do the math. I absolutely love to watch Charlize Theron, both for her obvious charisma as well as for her true dramatic ability. The way she was sucked into this piece of dreck could serve as a lesson. It\'s certainly a mystery to me why a woman who could take roles in ""Celebrity"" and ""Cider House Rules"" would select this script. Maybe she felt she could save him, because everything is focused on his character. She does not have . The script and the direction made this simply impossible. Even a real Theron fan, like me, will be very disappointed (even more so for Depp fans, which I\'m not one of.)'",0

"b'When Conan the Barbarian was released on video in 1981, I was one of the first to get it. The film did not lose the impact it had on me when it was 20 years old, and well ahead of all those pitiful movies of sword and witchcraft that made its appearance, including the terrible sequel Conan the Destroyer. so high in my esteem? Certainly not in the quality of acting; When you have two bodybuilders, a surfer, a sports star and a dancer like five of the main actors of this movie, then you\'re not going to have a theater class - but again this type of film does not need it . But having said that, they did a good job when the script demanded emotion. Mourning, indecision, loyalty, friendship. Everything was there. And revenge.Revenge is actually the thread of the story. For this, the co-authors John Milius (the director) and Oliver Stone must be applauded for not only daring to deviate from the path of Robert E. Howard\'s pulp books that gave the world Conan, but also for us give a coherent, tidy and pleasant script that does not insult the intelligence (unlike later). We have strong characters with whom you can sympathize and the bad guys you want to get with their own deserts. Arnold Schwarzenegger in his film debut is perfect for the role, as is James Earl Jones as the main antagonist, Thulsa Doom, who is so demonic and so powerful that he encourages a devotee to commit suicide just to prove a point to Conan. And throughout the story is a note of superior quality written by Basil Polidouris. From the beginning of the opening credits, there is a deep and thrilling percussive sound that can bring the viewer to another time and another place, and make them believe that it is the music of that time. Mako\'s voice over as the story is presented is unforgettable and I remember when I first heard it, my jaw dropped. BANG! In the theme song. Gutsy, hard and a delight.For me, the remarkable memory is the brilliant cinematography used when Conan prays his god, Crom, just before the final battle. He calls for revenge, while the camera turns with Thulsa Doom\'s tough cohorts, music in the background. Fantastic cinema is playing and can not be improved. This should never be redone because they could never do a better job. This has a great story, a good score, strong characters, unforgettable scenes, which unfortunately were missing as a result. I am not bound by any fidelity to Robert E. Howard\'s pulp fiction, so I do not care that this film has moved away from the ""real"" Conan world.'",1
"b'This film is a refreshing look on romance, very European (although of American manufacture) and with a fantastic chemistry. The unique, funny and (pseudo) intellectual conversation virtually incessant throughout the film is great and the characters are believable. One could almost think that the actors were not following a script but were instead looking at it, discussing their real ideas and plans. Although there may be a bit of kitsch ""we are all star dust,"" the character\'s reactions quickly correct any slippage of the reality of two stubborn young travelers to one another and with life.

"b""It is rather difficult to see these films again, because you have to understand all the reasons why this film should fail miserably. First, it's the sequel to Interview With the Vampire (though the third book in the series). The second book in the series (The Vampire Lestat) was not made in film, the producers of this film had to compile two books of history in one film. This is one of the reasons why the film left out most of the two books (read the books, by the way). Secondly, this film was a continuation of the extremely popular and successful Inteview With the Vampire. It was therefore quite impossible to repeat this formula. One of the reasons for this is that the previous movie was shot with very big stars (Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas, Christian Slater), while Queen of the Damned was composed with only one: Aalyiah. The rest of the cast was relatively unknown (Stuart Townsend is not really known yet). All of these problems aside, the movie itself is pretty awful. If you have read the book, you will be very disappointed, mainly because much of Rice's rich characterization is lost. No story of the vampire is revealed, more precisely the legend of the twins, which is totally absent. The rest of the vampires are seen only towards the end of the film and they are never named by name. If you have not read the book, you will not be able to tell who is who. Another silly point is that the older vampires, despite their short time on the screen, dress with the clothes of the time they were made, which is totally wrong in the book. Something that others might consider minor is the lack of disappointing physical resemblance between the characters and their counterparts in the books. For example, Marius is described as a man in his forties, with long gray hair and a beautiful face. Jesse is much older in the book, with very prominent red hair, and Armand's brief appearance is completely false, since he looks more like Lestat. The only good thing about Armand's physical appearance is his age: he is much younger here than in Interview With the Vampire, because the books say that Armand was made a vampire at the age of 17 years. Lestat is the only one that really looked like his description. Stuart Townsend was very much like my conception of Lestat, even though his voice was too deep. Still, he did not look as good as Tom Cruise in this game. Physical resemblance is important because vampires are described as being very sensual and beautiful, and the movies suffer from failing to bring these literary characters to film life. I will not really start with the inaccuracies with the book; there were too many. The main freedoms (apart from the absence of other vampires) were the relationship with Marius and Lestat. Lestat was not done by Marius, as others have pointed out, and Marius, portrayed as an evil vampire, whereas in the book he is Lestat's mentor and he only kills wicked men. The end is totally different and impossible to compare and contrast here (read the books). The main reason I think this has failed is that the film sacrificed a rich story for the refractions of pop culture. The soundtrack of this film and Lestat's brief career as a nu-metal star do more than anything else. For the reasons I described at the beginning of this review, I think the filmmakers were doomed to repeat the success of Interview With the Vampire, but that's no excuse for not even making an effort. Producers try to find excuses, especially for cut scenes, where they try to explain why they cut out more footage from other vampires. In conclusion, Queen of the Damned is a miserable failure, mainly to give up a rich and exciting story for references to pop culture. As I said, it would have been impossible to repeat the success of the old vampire movie, but this movie is just too horrible to stand out.""",0
"b'I liked Saturday Night Fever when I saw many years ago and it is still my favorite movie. A common misconception is that it\'s a Disco movie or a musical (like Grease). Saturday Night Fever is a hard, sometimes rude and violent look at the world of the working class and club life in the 70s (I was a little too young at the time of the Fever release to join the clubs but it was the same in the pre-AIDS world of the early 80s when I started playing club). Violence, sex and insults are REAL ... it\'s like that (and it\'s a bit without Bee Gee)! it\'s for !!) for those in Brooklyn (and other places in New York). John Badham did a great job putting the life of a 19-year-old who lived for the dance club on Saturday night. was frustrating and was not going anywhere (remember the lines: ""Your shot, you can not find anywhere else?"")

"b""You would think that a film with such a cast of stars would have redemptive qualities but this one does not do it. The characters are flat and provide no reason for the audience to be emotionally attached. The starlet character centered on Zeta-Jones is awful and dull, the depressive and lonely character of John Cusacks is unbelievable and impossible to attach to, Billy Crystal's news agent who tries to please everyone seems to be only present because she has a big smile. The highlight, if you can call it the love character of Hank Azaria's aliens. His character is horribly stereotyped, but at least he acts a little while speaking with an accent (even if the accent is exaggerated). Even Christopher Walken, who is good at pretty much everything is lost in this movie. His small role as a filmmaker does not even make sense - there is nothing in the film that gives clues to the end in which the Walken character plays a big role. The character of Jone and the character of John Cusack pull themselves together? - is completely lost because there is simply no chemistry on the screen. Their game is completely flat. This movie is disappointing, even compared to all the other bad romantic comedies. One last note - Doberman's gag might be fun and appropriate for Grade 3 students, except that Crystal's character seems to like being licked in the crotch by a dog. He even tells the dog where to lick. It's not funny - it's just disturbing.""",0

I really enjoyed the Alone in the Dark series of games. Even the last one, the New Nightmare, was good for a few hours of play. There was a good movie to make Edward Carnby's adventures, but that's not it. Now, Uwe Boll has got hold of Bloodrayne and Hunter: The Reckoning. What's next, Silent Hill? Doom? I can only imagine the band that this guy will cut through movie game adaptations if he is not stopped. Someone has to withdraw their line of credit, or these video game publishers have to realize and realize that when they make a bad movie in a game that kills the franchise, no one is interested in that title. Is House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark a viable game title? No way . A new House of the Dead game is coming out for XBox and nobody cares. The title is dead, and all because of Uwe Boll. So, if one of you works for a game publisher, or knows a game publisher, or has access to a game publisher ... please let them know. This movie itself is not even worth reading. I can not separate what I did not like from this pile of dung from the rest. Literally, everything is zero. Writing, playing, music, synthesis effects, editing. I thought that if I waited for the release on DVD and that I rent it with few expectations, I would not be disappointed.

His front tooth is completely rotten and he's a bit confused after playing Dogfood, but it's a great interview. Hilarious, insightful and intelligent. Iggy's interview is a welcome treat after watching the painful interview of John Lydon, a typical John Lydon. Yellow teeth, rotting, horrible, hard, terse and difficult. No music from PIL, however, just an interview. The Plasmatics are organizing an entertaining show. At one point, the guitarist crosses the public and falls completely on an elderly man who probably did not realize for which show he had received tickets. Another old lady has her fingers in her ears. Plasmaids blow up a car. Wendy O appears very sweet and a bit shy in her interview with Snyder, the antithesis of her character on stage and in Reform School Girls (****). The rones are always good. They are not interviewed by Snyder, however. He was on vacation that week. The punk round table of 1977 with Joan Jett, Paul Weller, Graham, etc. is interesting to listen to and see where the music comes from. Kim Fowley (producer, director, etc.) looks like a complete $ jacka, but adds considerable entertainment to the discussion. Overall, the sound quality of this DVD is not spectacular. The bass is thin, and the vox often eclipse the instruments, but the performances largely offset. It's a totally nostalgic trip to watch the episodes in their entirety and is often hilarious. It's funny that some of the same topics in the media today (violence in sport, economics, Ricky Schroeder) were the same stories they were talking about in the early 80s.""",1
"b'Harvey Pekar\'s comic, American Splendor, has launched a new genre: the autobiographical comic book. At first glance, the daily events of a Cleveland clerk hardly seem to be the material of an interesting film. Fortunately, filmmakers Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman are able to take what was funny, heartbreaking and fascinating about the life of Pekar and successfully adapting screens of the page to the big screen. Like Ghost World, American Splendor defends foreigners who do not correspond to the dominant society. In summary, the DVD contains a mini-comic that briefly tells how Pekar adapted his comic strip to a movie. The disc itself contains a captivating audio commentary featuring real Harvey Pekar, his wife Joyce, their daughter Danielle, his friend Toby Radloff, directors Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman, and actor Paul Giamatti. Everyone has fun on this track because they joke and remember the film and its experiences. ""Road to Splendor"" is a brief update of what Harvey has done since the creation of the film. The song ""American Splendor"" Eytan Mirsky, which appeared in the film, can be heard in its entirety. . His voice is strangely similar to that of Evan Dando of the Lemonheads.Finally, there is a movie trailer. American Splendor has the same ironic sense of humor and melancholy as Ghost World, another great cinematic adaptation of an independent comic book. American Splendor remains true to Pekar\'s vision - he refuses to sentimentalize his life, even at the emotional conclusion of the film that is truly moving. This is one of the most beautiful adaptations of comics ever made on films because it stays true to its sources and uses its creator to transfer its story from the page to the screen.'",1
"b""The film is a strange animal, okay, a work without genre, and Gordon sometimes seems to surpass himself, grasping the effects he is not able to achieve. The various styles, moods and genres give the film a slightly garish and amateurish look, but in the end (perhaps consciously from Gordon), this clumsiness works in favor of the film. The Singing Detective is a remarkably ingenious, fresh and daring work, almost childish in its lack of pretension, and easily one of the most original American films of the last twenty years. Most importantly, it features the painful, distressed and bitter pulp editor, afflicted by Robert Downey Jr.'s psoriasis, at the head of which the film unfolds (more or less) and Downey gives an inventive and powerful performance. huge talent Despite Downey's praise, Gordon's film ran into a wall of critical resistance, a real consensus of contempt. This may be due in part (at least in the UK) to a penchant for Potter's original television series; but it may have been due even more to the fundamental incompatibility of Potter's idiosyncratic and scathing vision with traditional (critical) tastes. Anyway, the film has once again tragically failed to find its audience. Like his previous adaptations, Gordon respected the source material without reverence, and as a director, he has a rare gift: the ability to merge his own sensitivity and talents with his subject at a fundamental level. In the case of The Singing Detective, it was a somewhat less homogeneous fusion; Potter's vision (his strange blend of musical fantasy with a dark psychological realism) was so surprisingly original that it required another sensitivity at least as strong and eccentric to merge. Gordon does not yet have the surrealist gifts to embrace Potter's vision, or to move to the next level (David Lynch could be the only director capable of that). He is a competent director from all points of view and seems to have the chance to have a natural rapport with the actors (perhaps why so many good people want to work with him). Yet Gordon is not a visionary director, and it was a visionary scenario. Fortunately, he had a visionary actor at a career peak to take over, and Downey wears the day. The Singing Detective is not a masterpiece; it is flawed and fractured and sometimes thin, even easy and sometimes redundant (especially in pseudo-black sequences). But it's an imaginative and intrepid film, an admirably eccentric work that manages to do something like justice to a brilliant writing. Full of inventive delights and heartfelt touches, he leaves most of the recent American movies in the dust. Yet both in the United Kingdom and the United States, it has failed so poorly that many people (including myself) have missed it, suspicious of the stench of failure. In this case, the bad smells did not come from the film, but from too corrupt and jaded critics to recognize a work of art when they saw it.

"b'Seeing this musical on a New York stage is an unforgettable experience and I went to see her four times. But seeing it on film is a totally flat experience. It just does not work on the screen for me. Although you have a cast of talent, the incredible energy and electricity that went through the scene were not found here. The musical is a carefree story based on a village and wet environment, filled with the edge. Since I lived in New York for 30 years, I immediately felt at home with this hidden world that the average person can not imagine. But spending two hours in a movie theater, watching this depressing and depressing story unfold, is a dark experience. The musical numbers all seem forced. People are not very friendly. They are all too dramatic and intense for the comfort zone and the reason the film bombed, is that Central America probably could not understand why the people in this movie did not pay the accursed rent - and avoid all the drama and problems! This film worked very well in the big cities where there were people who could identify with this story of tragedy and AIDS. But even for someone like me who knows this world very well, which takes place in the village where I lived, it is a depressing and depressing experience with very few optimistic feelings. I could not sympathize with drug addicts and prostitutes or any of the electrified musical numbers. They should have gotten a new cast for the movie version and open it up more in the dark and still wet world around this film treatment.'",0
"b'""The Exorcist"" by William Friedkin is a landmark. The cultural psyche is still recovering from its arrival on the scene more than thirty years ago. It\'s a masterpiece that will continue to last long after many horror movies have been forgotten. Actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) asks Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) for help after his daughter Regan (Linda Blair) begins to behave strangely. Realizing that something is wrong with the girl, Father Lankester Merrin (Max von Sydow) is summoned to do an exorcism. It then follows a terrifying battle between the forces of good and evil, which pushes all actors to their physical and spiritual breaking points. Words can not effectively convey the power of the ""exorcist"". ""It\'s a film that tirelessly attacks the senses and does not apologize. The genre entries that followed had no choice but to follow his example, as he redefined alone what the audience understood as a cinematic horror. Although Linda Blair rightly receives a lot of attention for her excellent work, do not neglect the equally powerful performance of Jason Miller as Father Karras. It gives the film an important human element that keeps it rooted. Without Karras\' bow, ""The Exorcist"" is just another punch that is trying to win quickly with thrills. Truly revolutionary, ""The Exorcist"" is an amazing work that has dared to test the limits of filmmaking. No serious discussion of the great cinema is complete without mentioning it.'",1

"b'The ultimate editions of the Harry Potter series come out from movies 1 to 6, but nothing exists for the first part of the Deathly Hallows or a pre-order option for an ultimate edition of the second part.

What are those of us interested in having a complete set of ultimate editions supposed to do? Sit down and wait to see if they come out (even if the first part was published a long time ago and there was a lot of time to produce a ""final edition"")?

"b'This 90-minute DVD of PBS is a little misnamed, but remains a great entertaining performance. The DVD gathers excerpts of performances of 10 musicians or groups who better come under the title ""Americana"". Some are best described as ""bluegrass"", including the famous Ricky Skaggs and the Cherryholmes family group. Singer / songwriter Darrell Scott and Steve Earle\'s son, Justin Townes Earle (whom I love both) are best rated as ""Americana"". The young 18 South mix country and bluegrass, while Will Hoge is closer to rock than anything. Depending on the age of his appearance and the song he is playing, I suppose that - even though this DVD dates from 2011, the JT Earle clip was recorded about four years ago. I could not identify the others. The performances have been recorded with a live audience and it\'s nice to see the rocks of the Caverns in the background, but as the musicians are so well mocked, I\'m not sure makes the sound better, or different. There are no real introductions; the performer is identified by a title on the screen. So, there is no filling here. I enjoyed seeing artists I know and love (If you have not seen the whitest Black Gospel singer - Mike Farris - it\'s your chance!) For one - I\'d love to see a sequel to this DVD.I hope you found this review informative and useful.Steve Ramm \'\' Anything Phonographic \'\''",1
"b""There are those who criticize JFK, claiming that Oliver Stone ignored the facts and rewrote the story. True or not, it completely misses the point. Stone himself stated that his intention in making the film was to get his audience to question authority and think for himself. The film is presented as a POSSIBLE explanation (a combination of two separate theories) for the unusual events that led to the assassination of Kennedy, and it actually raises more questions than it solves. The casting is phenomenal. Award-winning cinematography and editing are revolutionary to say the least. Despite your opinion of JFK's politics, the film is one of the very few that I would say perfect. That's why I'm a filmmaker and every second you spend watching it is worth it.

"b'First of all, I want to inform you that I am a big fan of Recess. So, that comes from a fan\'s point of view. So, do you really want to know what it is? It\'s like the DVD ""Miracle On Third Street"" where real stories are loosely held together. There are 4 real stories (3 TV episodes already seen) and only one new episode of 13 minutes. It begins when TJ and his band return to the old abandoned playground at the back of the playground and are captured by kindergarten children. They are held hostage by the new leader called Chief Stinky and the gang tries to tell them stories about their experience with kindergarten children and, finally, Gus tells when the gang was in kindergarten (the new episode). ""The Legend of Big Kid"", ""Wild Child"" and ""The Kindergarten Derby"". The bonus DVD episodes titled ""The 3 Favorite Episodes of Fans"" are: The Challenge, the Who\'s Who Story and One Stayed Clean. * I doubt they are the most preferred because I know that ""The Experiment"" is very popular among fans because that\'s when TJ and Spinelli kiss for the first time. Also if you wonder why Gus is on the cover when he is supposed to be entering Third Street in 4th grade. Well, on the DVD, Gus went to Third Street during kindergarten, but only for a few weeks, and he remembers only kindergarten while the rest of the gang does not remember anything this year, which explain why Gus is covering. Note that the voices of TJ and Mikey are different (not too different nor boring but perceptible) because the voices of the actors of the original voice had become too deep. Anyway, when I bought this DVD, I thought it would be an adventure of an hour in history when TJ and the gang were kindergarten children ... but unfortunately it was not the case. It was really pathetic for Disney to do it and to give such a carefree part of episodes ""already seen on television"". I only gave him 2 stars because of the new episode. If you bought Miracle on Third Street and you were disappointed, I do not think you would want that. If you\'re a new fan, and you have not seen all the episodes, then this is an excellent DVD for you! If you are a parent and consider it just a whimsical entertainment for your child, I would suggest it to you, but mostly because the DVD and episodes are hilarious, but can also convey good messages of friendship and trust. I know most kids like this because my younger cousins \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b(about 8-12 years old) also love the cartoon and can relate to the characters with them at school. I hope this will help you!'",0
"b""The stories of Dumas have been filmed so often, but it's always a joy to see them. This new version of Count Monte Christo is no exception. It has serious flaws and errors, too numerous to list. For example: modern lines of language, totally unbelievable interpretations (as other commentators have mentioned), very amateur characterizations (the Count turns his locks and his old love recognizes him by the gesture rather than by his appearance almost unchanged). None of these things really disgusted me. I just sat down and enjoyed. The opening scene set the tone and the photograph generally showed beautiful settings. The end was incredibly sober, but as I had just watched a wonderful fight and fencing scene in a lush setting, I did not care. background music and noises. I hope you read the book, if you have not already done so. No film has ever made the story of Dumas telling justice. The version of Three Musketeers with Michael York as D'Artagnan has come closer.If you just want to entertain, this movie can match your mood. I saw him three times now.""",1
"b'Breakdown is a terrifying film that goes into the faintest fears of our time, happily and perhaps sardonically representing what happens when we discover that our $ 50,000 SUV is not enough to protect us. Kurt Russell is Jeff Taylor and his wife, Amy (Kathleen Quinlan), took root in Massachusetts to move around the country by the method of conduct. After talking with a trucker because their Jeep breaks down in the Utah desert, the terrifying fun begins. As in Duel de Spielberg, malevolence arrives like a big truck. The trucker named Red (JT Walsh) agrees to give Amy a lift for the nearest payphone while Jeff stays with the car. Now, it\'s easy to wonder why Jeff would let his wife go with a stranger into an 18-wheeler, but put yourself in the same situation and you\'d probably do the same thing. We will seek help, the other remains with the car. Amy disappears, never showing up at Belle \'s Diner, where she had to meet Jeff. Customers have never seen it. And when Jeff continues Red\'s Rig, Amy is not found. Even worse, Red says he has never seen Jeff before in his life. What happens now is to find the woman. ""What a great excitement the cast gives, especially to Russell as a nervous, ready to step into the shoes of her husband who let his wife lose her loving hand on this lonely road when a trucker said: Come with me , I can help you. Russell turns out to be an obsessed husband who let his wife go. He becomes totally focused, almost obsessively so as to know why this city has never seen his wife, the lips are closed and you certainly have the opinion that it is CreepVille, Utah. What a fun ride. You will have sweaty hands everywhere.'",1
"b""Robocop 2 is probably the most underrated and hardest criticized suite in history (in conjunction with Predator 2, released the same year). Because of a few missing elements from the first and a slightly more caricatural approach to violence, critics and the public were not thrilled and opinions and feelings about the franchise collapsed with the just terrible. of a good movie however. Robocop 2 always has the same sense of wild humor, the cynical social commentary and the pathetic character of the first film. It is a hyper-realistic vision of a America populated by a gun-loving psychopath, a corporate democracy and a poverty-stricken addict delivered to them by hawkers who believe they are the second coming of Christ. to be the typical way to describe it. Completely on the top would be more appropriate. Empire Strikes Back director, Irvin Kershner, engages in so much sadistic violence, deafening gunfire, endless destruction and loss of life that the film asks you not to take seriously. Cartoonish than the original. I do not think it's very fair. I read Miller 's original script when I was in high school and it' s quite different and, I say, inconceivable. Robocop 2 himself was not Nuke Lord Caine, the psychotic hippie with illusions of Godhood. His name was Kong, a psychotic policeman who practically killed everyone. Sgt. Reed and the old man died and there was not much humor. Screenwriter Walon Green has been hired to handle the script and much of what appears on the screen is actually his job. The original ideas of Frank Miller have practically remained as a frame for the whole film and part of its history has been recycled in Robocop 3 (do not blame it either). Miller was visibly upset about this, but he was still good enough to be featured in the movie (watch him play Dr. Frank), though he vowed to stop working in Hollywood for fear of profit. Until Robert Rodriguez is engaged on his graphic novels of Sin City.Verhoven may have left but Irvin Kershner strives to deliver the same mix of gaiety and magic and in fact he succeeds. The fascinating score of Basil Poledouris is also gone (she returns in Robocop 3), but the new composer Leonard Rosenman creates a wonderfully heroic and optimistic theme that is better suited to the film than Poledouris' morose and tormented score. This time, you really must feel Peter Weller walking around this Robosuit. He had to weigh a ton and he would sweat bucket loads inside. There is a special scene in the film where Murphy is tortured into near-death / destruction, which is very difficult to watch. But this leads him to make new skin and to put himself at the head of these new insane directives. The piece where he gives lectures to Little League children and scolds young people playing with the leaking fire hydrant (after citing a very suspicious philosophy) is hilarious.Robocop 2 is a great movie. Despite some problems with the script and the story and some slightly outdated stop-motion effects, it's a brilliant sequel that meets expectations. Listen to the unspoken. I do not know what kind of movie they were waiting for. And thank you for not smoking! The DVD is a 1.85: 1 widescreen anamorphic widescreen with vibrant colors (take a look at the chrome of Robo's armor) and Dolby 5.1 sound. I am a little sad that there are no comments such as comments because I would have liked to hear what Kershner has to say about the film. And there are deleted scenes I know who have visited Murphy in his grave and some more details on why Caine is so strange. We can only hope that in the future ...""",1

"b'This 30th anniversary edition features the original movie Night of the Living Dead and features a new soundtrack and new scenes. As far as I\'m concerned, the original movie was perfect as is and it was not necessary, but I decided to stay open and give this edition a chance, knowing that the new material was written by John Russo ( who co-wrote the original film), and Hinzman\'s photography (and acting) (which also helped to create the original). I was completely disappointed. The new scenes include a new introduction, various scenes of zombies scrolling and killed by hicks and a new epilogue. The various scenes sometimes interfere with the unfolding of the film, the makeup is less effective and some of the new extras are terrible. They do a decent editing job in the new scenes, but they are still noticeable (for example, the modes are not quite correct). The new introduction and the epilogue are ridiculous. The intro simply states that the leading zombie (played by Hinzman) was a criminal when he was alive. This removes from one of the movies the most effective elements: the zombies could be your neighbor or a close friend or relative, but they will still try to kill you. Hinzman is obviously older in the frontal shots (the profiles are correct). When he starts attacking two gravediggers, one of the ""actors"" begins to flee and then realizes that Hinzman was supposed to catch him first, so he goes back to the coffin and bends down so that Hinzman can catch him! ! ! The fact that they have not taken a second shot shows a lack of care. The epilogue is an interview ""a year later"" with a preacher mad of fire and sulfur, who survived the carnage. He is stuck in the middle (spoiler warning) of the scene where Duane Jones was killed and the end credits showing the hicks throwing his body! ! Talk about interfering with a very effective ending! You have the opportunity to watch the original cut (on a great copy), but you can watch it with the new soundtrack! The old soundtrack consisted of library music, but it worked perfectly. At best, the new soundtrack is mediocre. Sometimes it does not even fit the mood of the scene, for example, being frenetic when the action is more calm and depressive. The booklet contains mostly interviews with actors talking about how new scenes have been added and how old fans will love the new (fake) version. There is a fun commentary track, but you get the same people (as well as others, including Romero) giving the same information on the commentary tracks of the very superior Elite Millennium Edition.'",0

Yes, there was so much to work on in the story. It could have been deeper, the plot more involved. The characters could have been so much more than them.

Half of the book talks about Aslan and the children, so the fact that they left their importance out of the movie really ruins the story. No Aslan, not Narnia! There are a number of other aspects that do not fit the book, but some of them might be more easily overlooked if they had not moved away from the real ""heart"" of the story. The other big disappointment for me was how they altered Peter\'s character. His whole attitude has changed. You never have the chance to warm up and, finally, you are almost happy not to return to Narnia. (The same can be said for Susan.)

Queen Of The Damned illustrates, at the very least, that Anne Rice is a wonderfully creative author, but I found that this film version of one of her books was very dull, with many thin characters. The vampire Lestat (wonderfully played by Stuart Townsend) decides to come out of retirement, which is actually a sleep of several hundred years. It gives a great overview of the world of vampires - you know, hate light, garlic and all things sacred. love the darkness, the necks of young, attractive women of blood and the eerrr ""Nu-Metal! ""But what annoys him the most is that he is immortal. I mean he does not age at all, seems to have unlimited financial resources - yet he is so bored with life. It seems to me to be a sort of spoiled vampire! So, he thinks that if he can totally provoke all the other vampires, then maybe they will get so angry that they will get him out of this eternal misery - and who better than the Queen of the damned - or Aaliyah to us? . How does it provoke them? Well, he becomes the singer of the most important and controversial Nu-Metal band in the world. Hey, I would definitely be with all the other vampires. There are interesting aspects to this film: how he became a vampire and how he reacted is quite fascinating. In addition, everything is done with typical Gothic colors and images. The monologue of his thoughts is filled with a comical irony and is delivered in a wonderful way. Some of the subtle interactions between the characters are also hilarious. Aaliyah looks amazing in her role as queen of all vampires - she really has a presence on screen and what a tragedy that her acting career and musician\'s was interrupted. The conflicts between vampires and vampires that cross the film are also quite original. Unfortunately, none of the effects are particularly dramatic. Overall, although the idea is good, development and history are too weak to make a memorable film.'",0
"b'This is a 70s horror movie based on the hit book of the ""true"" story of a haunted Long Island house. It was debunked and turned out to be a real deception, but the film spawned a dozen sequels and even this necessary remake. basement. Yes, it is quite overwhelming to think that if such a passage existed in something called Hell, it would be in Amityville, Long Island. James Brolin is the husband, a tough guy. Margot Kidder is the woman who reacts with big wide eyes when she witnesses a ghost, a hallucination, an atrocity, etc. Most fears indeed open doors or something, looking at something, then the music becomes really loud, then we see people\'s eyes, closer, and then, da-da! A nerdy special effect. Good for the value of nostalgia. The appearance of Rod Steiger as a mad priest is a major asset. Like a cheap exorcist. If these types of movies scare you, it might be worthwhile to spend a slow night. Good for involuntary laughs too.'",0

The wonderful one-liners. I also agree with what I saw on the Internet: the character of Vernon Wells `` Bennet '' is nil. Some people think he wears a chain mail for some reason, so do not be fooled into thinking he's dressed as a medieval knight. Nevertheless, 5 stars, pick it up.""",1

"b""The war against humanity is at its peak. The planet Roku San is at its hardest point. With the military support weakening, soldiers are dying every day and, with the new insects that are constantly revealing themselves to the world, how will humanity survive without you? The Federation is currently looking for men and women to help fight this terror. How would you like to be a hero and how would you like to become a citizen while you are there? Do you want to know more? STARSHOOP TROOPERS as a series became sadly known, if only because the second film did not contribute to the script of the first film. With little hope in mind, I started to look at STARSHOOP TROOPERS: MARAUDER in the hope that, one way or another, it would be better than the second, and perhaps as well as the first. . with STARSHIP TROOPERS 3.Situated on the planet Roku San and following our original hero, Johnny Rico, the film will soon have little hope when we learn some of his characters. Johnny Rico, experienced in his new years in the army, has always been known not to follow orders, but in the case of death? The sky marshal, one of the most famous men on Earth, is a pop star? And the soldiers who normally would not be hit by the stars, are seduced by the presence of the Marshal singer, often to the point of completely disobeying orders and ignoring external threats? What does the series also have, if not a total cheese factor? Unfortunately, that does not diminish anytime soon. Jolene Blalock, Angelina Jolie's actress, leading a small group of people in the Roku San Desert, ends up falling into the trap of an exaggerated attempt at a sci-fi movie. PROS: - Some actors. Jolene Blalock played her character very well, just like Marnette Patterson as Holly Little. I must also give the man who played Johnny Rico the credit of having contributed to this film. I do not know how much they paid for it, but with a bit of luck, to justify his time playing in a very bad underdeveloped movie. The long list of disadvantages: CONS: - The CGI. Since the first movie was shot in 1997, it was incredibly disappointing that the CGI was so bad. Given the advancement of computer graphics technology, one would think that a film would be at least up to the standards in 1997. No - that was not the case. There is no longer any need to think that. Actors Game. Most of the actors were filled with poor actors and actresses. Too accentuated, not accelerated, not stressed at all - I found very few actors to watch. I could not help but cringe as to how some played their characters and how many of them were represented. The military and women do not follow what we, as individuals, would think they would do, marshals and officers command troops in senseless and absurd maneuvers, and soldiers throw themselves on explosive insects when they can simply withdraw. Value is not even a problem here - his stupidity is wreaking havoc. - Cheese. Yes, I specifically mentioned cheese, if only because it is very relevant in this movie. The Sky Marshals as popstars, the soldiers being told that they will be shot if they ask for an autograph, then trying to ask for an autograph, the senior officers of the Federation not bothering to shoot a weapon while they fight ruthlessly, then trying to arrest a soldier for tearing him out of the assailant - there is not much foolishness to do to this film, because the cheese factor is not lacking in stupidity. wonder what exactly happened to this movie. STARSHIP TROOPERS 2 was in itself a disappointment, but three? ... it's horrible . It's better than 2, if only because it follows the scenario and the world's first best construction, but it's still not a movie worth watching. The STARSHIP TROOPERS franchisee should be dead after the first. MARAUDER should quickly die a slow and horrible death, if only because it tarnishes the original to the point of disappointment. I was excited to see this, despite the warnings that many of my friends had given me. I will definitely not watch a fourth in this movie. If I even start trying, I'll remember how two and three were horrible, then push the first movie into the DVD player, if only because the first one will always be the only good movie STARSHIP TROOPERS.""",0
"b""This film could have been so much better, but they just had to ruin it, did not they? With the exception of the very good performances of Denzel Washington, Ed O'Neill and Queen Latifah, the rest of the film is just collapsing. The plot seems so ridiculous that I can not help but look elsewhere. Angelina Jolie's role is below average, but she did her best. The end of the twist was not very disappointing, but it fell flat because of its exaggerated suspense (or lack thereof). I did not really like watching this thriller. There are better ones like Se7en and The Usual Suspects. Look at these two, and you'll see how a real thriller should be.""",0
"b""I loved this movie when I was little, so I thought about buying the DVD. I saw a criticism about the quality of the image, but I still bought it. I thought a lightly striped print would be better than a used video tape with a picture spinning. The print is damaged by the pinion, causing the image to flicker on the screen. It seems they used the light bulb of an easy-fired oven to project this impression. Calling the muddy photo would be a compliment. All life and color were sucked from this movie. Did I mention that the movie was not even focused. The sound was pretty bad, but I'm not really an audiophile to talk about it. Do yourself a favor and look for the VHS version. It can not be worse than this copy. Or could it? : - (""",0
"b'As a longtime fan of this program, I was deeply disappointed that Sony had not ""restored"" the film as it was claimed. The movie printing used for video transfer is scratched and filled with specifications, fuzz, etc. As many other commentators have noted, the soundrack has nothing to do either. Really, you\'d better get an old VHS version of the program because the ""bonus"" features of this DVD reissue are insignificant (no ""feature creation"", interviews, etc.). A program that this loved person surely deserves a restoration using the original sources (if any) for the film and the soundtrack.'",0

"b""It's one of my favorite black films, a great film in which Welles has shown the world that he can make a classic Hollywood film without going over budget while producing a real personal masterpiece. I own two other previously released transfers of this public domain film, none of which has done justice to the film. They look like worn out VHS cassettes. They are so bad Finally, at no extra charge and at a relatively high price, MGM has released what seems to be a transfer of a very good original 35mm print, or even the original negative. The picture is very clear and sharp, with deep blacks and I can finally enjoy the film as Welles wanted. Buy it .""",1
"b""Coleman Silk (Anthony Hopkins) is a well respected dean and teacher. After an innocent remark has been misinterpreted as a racist comment, he is forced to leave his job in disgrace. Coleman begins a strange affair with a goal-less woman (Nicole Kidman), half-elderly, who has had a tragic past and is not ready to restore her love. For me, this strange little film was doomed from the start, when the big finish is indicated immediately. The rest of the story is represented by irregular and irregular flashbacks (often out of order) that allow no accumulation of tension or sympathy for the main character, Coleman. As a young man from New Jersey, he is played by Wentworth Miller, who is very charismatic and friendly, but does not resemble the adult Coleman with Welsh accents (which sometimes seems to channel Hannibal Lector). Hopkins is so horrible in this role that it's impossible to buy a racist plot. Kidman was also completely wrong for this movie; Her innate grace and elegance could not be hidden by a messy hairstyle and I never bought her as an illiterate babysitter. His graphic love scenes with Hopkins were more frightening than romantic. There are so many personal tragedies among the main characters - including Gary Sinise who plays a struggling writer and Ed Harris as a crazy Vietnamese veterinarian - and yet connection with them or the premise of injustice. Subsequently, I found myself shaking my head in front of this surprising film and just astonished that so much talent could not save him.""",0
"b'& quot; Coffy & quot; (1973) made Pam Grier a star, & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; (1974) clearly shows why Grier became a star. & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; simply distil Grier \'s star qualities and use them to their full potential, and by star quality, I do not just refer to his generous bosom. In & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; Grier is a mad raped, raped at all costs for revenge, it does not only gnaw the scene, it erases it. But that\'s exactly why we love Grier. She is beautiful, sensual and she can get completely fucked! As far as I\'m concerned, she is the original action hero of the screen and this vehicle best represents her star acting skills. Unlike & quot; Coffy, & quot; & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; does not give Grier much of a chance to flex his acting muscles, but he puts Grier aside: Foxy ransacks apartments, beats hostile lesbians, tears eyes, burns men, emascule (literally and figuratively), and even shoot guns from her perfectly coifed afro. & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; It is a classic cult movie for the same reasons. & quot; Coffy & quot; may be the best movie, but & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; is more pleasant. So how does it work? Foxy Brown & quot; price on DVD? Well, the record is an absolute revelation. Since the beginning of the film, it did not seem so good. The transfer of the first image used for the videocassette and the laser disc was atrocious, with yellowish tones of flesh, excessively saturated colors, dark, dark interiors, ruined compositions and terribly raised edges. The new anamorphically enhanced widescreen transfer is bright. The compositions are properly preserved with a 1.85: 1 aspect ratio, more distracting leeway and a bit of image information is added to the sides. The interiors now reveal woodwork, earth-tone wallpapers and brown curtains, unlike the previous transfer that made almost all black or dark brown. The flesh tones are finally natural and the colors of the film are reduced to an understandable level of saturation, but do not worry, the modes of the 70s remain a bright kaleidoscope of the flourish. The sharpness is nice; the enhancement of the edges never comes out in his ugly head and the sky of the film is finally blue. Finish the olive tree and the yellow light. The grain of the film is visible in some dark scenes and there are some defects of source. Considering that it is a low-budget film produced in 1974, the source element is almost virgin. The compression on the disc, however, is not so perfect. Some dark and shady areas and dissolved bottoms are frequently subject to tiling artifacts, but for a retail price of just $ 14.95, who can complain? The extras include the amusing theatrical trailer (""Foxy has guts: no if, and or buts!"") And an insightful commentary track by director Jack Hill that repeatedly describes the difficulties of working with AIP (American International Pictures) about this film, which he claimed to be one of his worst performing experiences. The monaural sound on the record is commendable; the dialogue is always intelligible and the bass level makes Willie Hutch\'s score as funky as it was 27 years ago. Jack Hill created Pam Grier his own sub-genre with & quot; Coffy & quot; and & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; and when she left him after the sadness of 1976 Friday Foster, & quot; no one took his place ... no one could ever do it. & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; is the ultimate Pam Grier action vehicle, a classic blaxploitation and an excellent DVD! If you have only seen & quot; Foxy Brown & quot; on videocassette or laserdisc, you have not seen & quot; Foxy & quot; at all .'",1
"b""This film is about a million times better than the recent Red Dragon remake. The film's real conflict is Will's (William Petersen's) tenuous understanding of his sanity as he tracks down a killer who is about to strike while dealing with a killer he has already caught. While Brian Cox's Lecktor will make comparisons with Anthony Hopkin's version in subsequent films, Cox interprets the psychopath as a real threat - a murderer who will kill. Hopkins is also great, but I always felt that his reader was like an animal that would hit only in a very provoked way. We see Cox and Petersen as equals on both sides of the fence, with little difference between them, aside from Petersen's knowledge of good and evil. This thriller is one of the best.""",1
"b'I am a long time follower of Smallville and every year there are always fans (including myself) who mark the current year as Jumping the Shark. If you go through my profile, you will see that my critics of the old seasons start with enthusiasm and become more critical over the years. Even if I will not comment on season 8, the trend seems to be confirmed when you compare season 7 to the previous 6: they are quite great compared to this brothel. on this year. Smallville always has great comic stories, but lacks development and internal logic in his own world. The authors jump from one plot to another without any stimulation, so you get dramatic events that change life and are completely forgotten by the next episode. There is a shocking twist involving the new Daily Planet Editor which has been shortened when it becomes interesting; the return of Clark\'s biological mother, Lara, lasts just one episode; Bizzaro appears and is quickly defeated - twice; Clark travels in time and space to save his baby on Krypton in five minutes. Sam Jones finally returns as Pete Ross and is wasted in a horrible product placement. Supergirl is introduced and barely developed before she struggles with the clich\xc3\xa9 of amnesia and disappears for most of the season. Why not settle on 2 or 3 scenarios and develop them correctly? And do not blame the writer\'s strike, which cuts this season by 2 episodes - the problems were obvious before the strike happened. Speaking of outside influences, several characters leave the series this year. The sudden departure of Kristen Kreuk to film Street Fighter leaves his already weak character a rather anemic farewell - fortunately, she will return briefly in season 8 to equalize. Another character I will not spoil will die of a noble death and we will miss him. This is the departure of Rosenbaum who is the real kicker. Not only does Smallville\'s best actor not return, but he has an ambiguous and unsatisfactory end. Barely seven years of amazing work. There are things that Smallville did well this year - the return of Brainiac and the screenplay of ""Veritas"" bring a sense of continuity that is sorely lacking in the series. But overall, there is a lack of coherence that seasons 5 and 6 have tried to have, and the show has no heart now that Kent\'s parents are gone. Whether you need this season or not depends on whether you have bought the first six and you absolutely want the complete collection.'",0

I found many of the film's key themes to reflect and consider in relation to my own life. I liked the questions of the pyramids: 1. Have you found joy in your life? 2. Have you brought joy to other lives? This movie is probably not the one to hit when you're in the mood for something light and funny.

This has been a major problem for me too, with Alias \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b- Buena Vista changing the packaging for each season. It is really boring. Moreover, special functions are nothing. Some interesting features, but overall the supplements are very low for the last season. Everything happens as if nothing had happened, as no one thought it was the last season of such a beloved series. If you have the means, I strongly encourage you to invest in the complete collection. It is very well done and put in place (although there are some flaws) and there is a bonus disc with very informative and fun bonuses to watch.

"b'""The Necklace Affair"" may be based on a true story, but it is also an exciting historical novel, ""The Necklace of the Queen,"" by Alexandre Dumas, who certainly had more than the ""Three Musketeers"" . \'\' in his sleeve. Dumas tells the identical story of Joseph Balsamo (aka Comte Cagliostro), Jeanne de la Motte Valois, Cardinal Rohan, but the great diamond scam, although the filmmakers give no credit to Dumas (I see that the book is available) on Amazon.com, and I highly recommend it!). The costume designer, Malena Canonero, deserves praise for the bands of silks, satins and lace jabots that beautifully recreate the opulence of the 18th century court of Louis XVI. The settings are also beautiful. I found a lot of the music shocking, however, as the composer insisted on giving it a modern beat at times, and also used a mishmash of Mozart\'s Requiem, among other things. I find such cuts and rearrangements of a bar here; a bar, both lazy and a little cheat. In the featurette, the director explained that he wanted to make the period ""accessible"" to the modern public. Such ""accessibility"" not only insults the intelligence of the modern audience but also weakens the film. Because the story is so strong, I nonetheless enjoyed the film. I was particularly impressed by the performances of Jonathan Pryce as suave cardinal, Adrien Brody as Jeanne\'s scruffy husband and Simon Baker, who is particularly endearing as his loving love. All are credible and move well in their silks. Although Hilary Swank is an excellent actress, I thought she misinterpreted this role. She looks a little uncomfortable in her costume and moves more like a woman of the 21st century than the 18th century.

"b'I do not usually use the space provided for product reviews to comment on the condition of a particular product, or to draw attention to a less reputable buyer. In this case, however, I will make an exception. The DVD I received today, sold via Amazon LLC, the one listed as ""Passport to Pimlico"" (Remastered Edition), is obviously a homemade work. The outer label is a color photocopy, that of the DVD itself is in black and white, for the sake of God.

My assumption when I read the word ""remastered"" is that the print is made from an existing negative, or cleaned significantly; I certainly expect the studio, the filmmakers or at least the film historians to participate in the production of the record. Maybe the one who manages A2ZCDs has done some work of this kind on his home equipment, but that does not excuse the general public. years ago.

"b'Here is an enigma for all of you. What do you call ten liters of ice cream and a spoonful of manure? Ten gallons of manure. I do not care how much they dress the DVD version of this movie, it will not change the fact that it\'s terrible. I only give this star, but keep about five or six Advil at hand. That should be enough to cover you for that. A few jokes about this disaster: 1. It was directed by Uwe Boll, director of two of the most dreadful movies I have ever seen in ""House of the Dead"" and ""Alone in the Dark"". In what was a moment of brutal honesty for me, Boll himself admitted that he did not shoot the film until two weeks before filming began. What he ended up saying was a group of ""names"" who had a hole in their schedule and who came forward for a quick paycheck and a free trip to Romania. It can also be seen, the whole film has the impression of avoiding repetitions and no one seems even interested in making an honest effort. Will Sanderson and Michael Madsen may have discovered the only way to survive a Boll movie. They would have been completely drunk in all the production.4. Ben Kingsley, who had previously had to deal with Madsen on the film \'Species\', refused to be with him.5. In the harem scene with Meatloaf, these are HONEST TO GOD, 100% PROSTITUTES OF ROMAN. I swear you can not do that. Apparently, Boll could not afford real actresses (their unionization rate made them too expensive), so he decided to cut costs by placing an order for the real one. It\'s a disaster from the front to the back. I\'ll give it though, it\'s better than his last two movies. Bloodrayne, at least, is a bit unintentionally funny. Even saying that, I could never recommend anyone to see it. It only encourages the man to continue. Uwe Boll, undoubtedly in my mind, is the most talented director I have ever seen.

"b""This 1955 version is one of those smaller Akira Kurosawa films that are forgotten in favor of his greatest films like & quot; Rashomon & quot; and & quot; Seven Samurai & quot; but it's still worth seeing. The great Toshiro Mifune embodies an industrialist from Japan after the Second World War, who slowly gets mad at the idea that a nuclear war is being prepared and tries to convince his family (and his mistresses) to flee Japan with him. The obsessive portrait of Mifune is a matter of great tragedy, especially as he argues in vain with his family eager to leave and Takashi Shimura, the leader of samurai in & quot; Seven Samurai & quot; , is also effective as a counselor who is trying to help redress the situation. The film captures the Japanese fear of the atomic bomb, a subject that Kurosawa will also address in his masterpiece, & quot; Ikiru & quot; , very well and with the greedy family getting closer to a delusional patriarch, evokes King Lear & quot; , a tale that the director would come back several years later in & quot; Ran & quot; .

The montage of scenes and events would confuse a viewer quickly loses the plot as the film switches between the scenes of the narrator in Woking and his brother in London. at one point the brother is supposedly in a London street, then suddenly he attends the Elfinstone ladies\' attack on a country road and runs to their rescue. Much has been said about the meeting between HMS Thunderchild and the Martians while the brother escapes England with a ""paddlesteamer"". left aside. There is a highly publicized scene where the legs of a tripod are heading towards and above an artillery battery, which is probably the best effect in this film and shows what could have happened. There is a really terrible dialogue between the characters. I challenge anyone, for example, not to end up watching the exchange between the Elfinstone ladies and the brother as they ""discuss"" how they will escape from England. I also awarded the James Doohan Award for the worst Scottish accent we have seen since Brigadoon, when the narrator converses with a soldier at Horsell Common. On the other hand, when you watch the interaction with the actors trapped in the ruined house, as well as the meeting of the dead woman\'s narrator on a London street, you sadly remember what it might have been. filming 2 stars which is generous and for the following reasons.The music is fantastic.It is refreshing that the film is faithful to the events of the book and made the effort, albeit poorly, to place the book in Victorian England and no other version updated in the United States. Unfortunately, due to cost constraints, the British-style buildings are digitized and define the Monty Python style in a Washington state field to represent Woking, Shepperton or London. I liked the design of my 17 year old daughter who watched this movie was not at all impressed, but she was intrigued by the configuration and location of the film. As a result, she made the effort to read the novel and, to my surprise, read it from start to finish. The irony is that H.G Wells has conquered another young admirer despite the very poor quality of this film and I really appreciate it. Should I however recommend this film to a friend? Unfortunately not if I wanted them to stay friends.'",0
"b""Anyone who reads these reviews will have seen the TV production and will know it thoroughly. I will therefore limit my criticism to the quality of the DVD image - or rather to its absence. Too bad that what was once a beautiful and memorable TV movie has become a dilapidated shadow of his former identity. It is painful to see if something that has a special place in your heart is treated so badly. For years, the only version that millions of people had seen on TV had such a pale color and low contrast that it almost seemed to have been shot in black and white! If that's what you're used to, the & quot; restored & quot; the version on this DVD (and the one shown on TV the last 3 or 4 years) seems slightly better, but it is barely restored. Just watch a deleted song in the extras section to see how beautiful and bright the original production was: clean, crisp, immaculate, with very saturated colors. The time and money had to be spent to bring the rest of the film to the norm. It is morally wrong to put a defective product on the market and then have the nerve to charge it. As many of our parents probably told us when we were young, & quot; Everything worth doing is worth it! & quot;""",0
"b'COME EARLY MORNING Have you ever seen a movie and thought about it later, but not as a documentary, but simply as a piece of cinema that seems to have been removed from real life? If you\'ve ever felt this, there\'s a good chance you\'re watching this one here. ""Come Early Morning"" is a wonderful little film made wonderfully by Joey Lauren Adams of ""Chasing Amy"" and featuring the great Ashley Judd and, of course, Jeffrey Donovan. The film follows Lucy Fowler {Judd} on her journey through her thirties, waking each morning beside a useless man after another. She is also dealing with a father with whom she desperately tries to spend time, even if it seems to be indifferent to her. So the story tells that she is a desperate and confused woman who only seeks love and acceptance. Of course, you could say that his problems with men stem from his relationship with his father. Yet she eventually meets at least one decent man named Cal Percell {excellently portrayed by Donovan} who seems to want a relationship with her despite her problem. It is this relationship that drives the film, although the time spent with his father and his roommate adds an interesting dynamic. The great thing about all this is how it all ends. Writer / director Adams proves that all this time spent with Kevin Smith has paid off because it\'s a wonderful first film. His direction is excellent but it is his writing that makes this film so good. As I said, this has to be one of the most real movies I\'ve seen in a long time. I like the fact that she did not romanticize the main character and her problems, things do not end as you wish. This film has an end that is probably what would actually happen, how bad is it? Even those who have not grown up in a small town can relate to what is happening in this movie. Ashley Judd, of course, is great as the lost thirty-year-old tries to find her way. And you know that Jeffery Donovan is excellent as a guy who should have been the one for her. Laura Prepon of `` That 70\'s Show \'\', the celebrity is as good as the roommate and Judd\'s best friend, she even finds love. In addition, Scott Wilson is awesome in finding a religious father who seems as helpless as she is. In fact, the entire cast is awesome and deserves all the credit of the world. Apart from that, the film was also very well shot and for such a limited budget, it seems that the film showed the whole city, even if it was not the case. a moment and a wonderful start for a filmmaker. To those who look like this, I say spread the word and see it again now. And for those who have not seen it yet, I recommend this as a purchase but I guess you can try a rental. It\'s a wonderful movie with a big cast with real problems that everyone should be able to understand. I would love to go see this movie, but everyone can see it, if it\'s not your thing, but for those who like this kind of movies, you\'ll love this movie.'",1

"b'As a fan of lennon, I was very reluctant at first to see this movie. However, after being pushed by Beatles friends who had seen the film, I decided to praise it and was amazed by the quality of the film. Everything from casting to staging was perfect. I really enjoyed the ball Jonas Ball as well as the many impressive support players who lent their talents to the screen. For me personally, aside from Jonas, who is fantastic, I found that the psychologist and the taxi driver were also talented actors. Overall, I found that the murder of John Lennon was an extra-curricular film and I highly recommend it.'",1

"b""Right, pathetic. We can say that it is the case and I will note it as Stephen Dorff (Cecil B. Demented, Blade, Entropy) and the worst film of Christian Slater (Pump Up The Volume, True Romance, Heathers). Slater is the paranormal expert who, 22 years ago, was part of a laboratory experiment tested on the children of an orphanage. Slater tracks the artifacts of a lost civilization ... he was once part of a prominent elite government group tracking down a type of creature hiding in the dark and hating the light and no I do not speak vampires ... put it clearly, they look like mutated Godzilla children. Slater teamed up with ex-archaeologist Tara Reid (Van Wilder, Urban Legend, Cruel Intentions) and his former boyfriend for whom he worked in the elite government group ... played by Dorff. Everyone has thrown out the movie that we are suffering from big headaches as we watch a poorly written and badly filmed film with twisted turns and twists in which we know who died and who lives. Directed by the director of House Of The Dead, Uwe Boll, and I can tell you that this movie is Bolls ** t. He can not handle shit. What a waste of actors and what a waste of time. Divert this toxic waste. Why, well, if you suffer with action scenes with heavy metal scores and a corny love scene with Reid and Slater with the sexiest music ... it's your ticket.""",0

"b'The Banks family needs a new nanny for Jane and Michael. Fortunately, we get on the wind in the form of Mary Poppins. She is everything kids want, fun and magical. But while she takes them to chalk painting and tea parties on the ceiling, their father is less happy. Can we see it at the end of the nose? Ok, so this movie is really just an excuse for song and dance numbers. It\'s always great! The plot is thin, and you lose the place in the middle of some fantastic scenes. Of course, part of this is due to the fact that the film is based on a book that is nothing but short stories. Yet this film is more about pleasure than anything else. And that has it in spades. What child would not have liked to imagine that they could do all that Jane and Michael do in this movie? It is said that Walt Disney has poured everything he had learned to make this film, and it shows. Many of the special effects are remarkably resilient today. There were some that I still did not understand before watching this special edition. And the music! Any Disney fan knows these songs by heart. And you can not help but find yourself singing ""A spoonful of sugar"", ""Jolly Holiday"", ""Fly a kite"" or ""Chim Chim Cher-ee"" for a few days after seeing it. Those who want to own a large DVD of this movie will not be disappointed by this set of two discs. Disc 1 presents the film in all its splendor of screen. I can not see how it looks better. The soundtrack has many different options, but home theater mixing will amaze you. It\'s fantastic . There is also a commentary track featuring Julie Andrews, Dick van Dyke, Karen Dubice (Jane) and Richard Sherman. Watered are comments from other archives, including Disney itself. You will also find contextual information to read while watching the movie. Disc Two presents a new documentary about the film, a deleted song and more about music with Julie, Dick and the composers. And be sure to watch the animation ""The cat who watched a king,"" a tale adapted from one of the last books in the series. make it and how much they respect Walt Disney.

"b""I would not go as far as the previous reviewer saying it's a kind of liberal conspiracy film (and if so, I'd hate to hear what people are saying about movies like Ferngully and Once Upon In Forest). I doubt that the fact that most humans care less about our impact on the environment is a real flash for everyone, and that some of us do not die for reasons ranging from fun to necessity . That being said, however, I can not give this film a better rating. The CG animation is of a quality far inferior to that of the cover (more in line with a Saturday morning cartoon than a feature film). I do not think I found a single joke in the whole movie, and more than a few scenes were so rude that I preferred to watch them instead of watching them. The images are often dark and disturbing (the woman trying to decapitate a cat with a chainsaw comes to mind), and the peaceful outdoor scenes look very fake. The animation has several parts that are notoriously mediocre compared to a good movie CG (or even decent). In addition, humans are deformed almost beyond recognition. In short, there are many good CG titles, but it's certainly not one of them.""",0

The script itself is entertaining with uninterrupted philosophies and suspense. I would recommend this film very strongly as a training video for people in professions where leadership is the key to success. Keep a close eye on the fact that General Savage incorporates strict discipline with temperance in his interactions with his men. With respect, he also won the trust of the troops. This form of leadership is almost non-existent today. However, it's literally, & quot; proven fight & quot; .""",1

"b'This film begins with a simple question from Richard Lobb of the National Chicken Council: ""In a sense, we do not produce chickens, we produce food. This allows to produce a lot of food in a small space at a very affordable price. Let someone explain to me what\'s wrong with that. ""Well, this movie explains very well what\'s wrong. The first point is that it is not good to treat animals as if they were mere objects *. You will see chickens and oxen on their knees in their own droppings. You will also see hens in their cages, unable to even bear their own weight. Animals are kept all the time in the dark, including for us. It was very difficult for filmmakers to get pictures of the interior of these hen houses. The second point, related to the previous one, is that our food can easily be contaminated by E-coli, because of the excrement of animals. wear on their skin. This is how food poisoning can happen in the slaughterhouse. Barbara Kowalcyk, the mother of a 2.5-year-old child, has had the most horrific experience anyone can experience: the death of her child. .. The reason: eating a hamburger ""We trust our government to be protected, but we are not protected at the most basic level,"" she says. This is not an embarrassing truth - although this film was produced by the same company that brought us the documentary with the same title. It\'s a nasty truth. Can we do something about it? Absolutely. ""You can change the world with every bite"". Go to organic matter. Better yet, connect again with the source of your food, what you eat, what you put in your mouth! The best thing to do would be to get involved with a local farmer you know and trust.'",1
"b'The publication by Criterion of Spellbound of Alfred Hitchcock presents a slight defect. 74 minutes after the beginning of the film, we have a view of J.B.

""Then we cut to Brulov for his next line,"" Oh, I thought it was you. \'Simple, no? Well, the Criterion DVD cuts the razor\'s blade too early, then picks up Brulov\'s images, cutting his second line, while crushing his own! st! Then we get the 2nd line correctly. In other words, the images of Brulov\'s line ""Oh I thought it was you"" are gathered twice! ! So far, I do not know if the Criterion disk is the only affected version.

The problem is to use both sides of the DVD to store the episodes.

"b""Marcel Carne's Children of Paradise succeeds at so many levels that it rightly deserves to be called one of the greatest movies of all time. Carne filmed the film piecemeal during the Nazi occupation of Paris. His film was officially supported despite the occupation, while the Nazis wanted to show that they were friendly to the arts. This created the ironic situation that Carne was taking money from the government to support one film a day and channeling aid to the French resistance at night. An actor was supposed to be a Nazi collaborator. He mysteriously disappeared during the shooting and had to be replaced. Despite all these obstacles, Carne has managed to recreate beautifully the Paris of the nineteenth century. In this way, the film itself is a triumph of the creative spirit. The title refers to the poor, who could not afford seats so high in the theater that they were almost in full thrust. And yet, it was the real audience. the actors played for. The story is a series of lives that intersect one way or another around the bohemian, Garance (played in the fashion of Mona Lisa by Arletty). Beyond, the film also revolves around the Parisian theatrical life of 1840: the actors, the public and all the intermediaries. Garance is almost a courtesan: she moves comfortably between four men who love her, seemingly indifferent to any of them ... finally, she falls in love with the mime Baptiste (Jean-Louis Barrault) .... but Baptiste is married to another woman after missing his chance with Garance years ago. Will they meet? In the end, we, the viewers, are as much the children of the gods as the children of paradise, which the title calls the theater audiences in the film. Indeed, the opening and closing credits are played against a theater curtain. We are the spectators in the gods and the actors occur for us living their lives: to love, to live, to die ... to feel both pain and joy. Carne's film lasts more than three hours, but never lags behind. The stories intersect and can not be adequately described in a simple magazine like this one ... Four men like Garance and, in a way, their whole life intersect around the theater. Cinematography is incredible. There is a crowd scene at the end of the film that resists everything that has been filmed: it's just beautiful. Baptiste is lost (in many ways) in a moving mass of humanity. This scene alone is reason enough to see the movie. I suspect it's a movie that people like or hate. The long length can discourage many people, but it's a shame. The film is not for those who want instant gratification. Instead, it's something to enjoy and enjoy. If all this seems too serious, rest assured that this is not the case. Children of Paradise is a tragedy in some ways, but it's also a Shakespearean comedy. It was a movie made for a company like Criterion, and they do it in their DVD edition. The two halves of the film are presented on individual disks, so that the film never suffers from compression defects or other problems. The restoration is impeccable: we will never know that this film is almost sixty years old. The audio is mono but very clean, without hissing or static. Criterion also included supplements, previews, filmographies, trailers, etc., but the real pleasure is the movie itself. It's timeless.""",1

Nothing here seems shocking and the 14-year-olds now see this film as ""laughable."" is a pity, because there is much more than pea soup and spinning heads here, it\'s really about the terror of the unknown ... the fear and trepidation involved in all metaphysical things and This is the mystery of faith and its ability to triumph in the end. pictures, sounds and history ... everything concurs here. It\'s incredibly well written by Blatty. Friedkin\'s sense of documentary realism serves the plot well. The acting is excellent with a casting that could not have been more perfect. Dick Smith\'s make-up is revolutionary, not only with Linda Blair, but also with Max Von Sydow who was in her 40s or 40s at the time. Owen Roizman \'s use of varied light textures and, of course, his masterful and emblematic photograph of Merrin\' s arrival, is also remarkable.

"b'Ripe is not a sexual exploitative Lolita movie, as the supersaturated key art suggests. Instead, it is a difficult and off-the-wall exploration of female sexuality and age, imaginatively directed and well-acted through its three tracks. The script sometimes becomes rough and brutal with many independent films, but the film is visually stunning, and the accumulation of little moments is delicious - when Violet discovers adult magazines, for example, or when the hangman who takes the sisters has to explain the rules.

"b'In simple terms: Style over substance. There are some excellent sequences, but that\'s all that this movie seems to be, well-planned and executed sequences - but nothing coherent sticking together. The ""crash plane and the last-minute rescue"" are extremely impressive and the machine gun ammunition coming out of Supe\'s chest, followed by the bullet in the eyes, is beautiful. My jaw dropped and I almost wanted to applaud. This is what Superman is talking about: seeing him defeat the bad guys in a new, attractive, even fun way. But that was where the pleasure ended. Like what Superman is not sure about, it\'s the children\'s love and ridiculous heroics with kryptonite. I find that both are so implausible that they both must be ridiculed. As Brodie (played by Jason Lee in Kevin Smith\'s Mallrats) points out, ""It\'s impossible! Lois Lane has never been able to have Superman\'s baby. Do you think that his fallopian tubes could support his sperm? I guarantee you that when he comes during sex, he will probably explode like a gunshot ... on his back. ""Apart from the fact that Lois Lane is alive after coitus, you would then have the impossibility for a human being to conceive and bring to term the child of a stranger. Remember that the fact that Clark Kent looks and acts ostensibly like a human is an alien. He is a completely different species. And entirely different species can not mate. Just think of the ravages it would cause in the animal kingdom if a lion fell in love and mated with a crocodile. Or a guinea fowl. The other problem that thrills me with anger is the Cretinist concept of Superman\'s physical ability to lift a whole continent of kryptonite into space. As the internet blogger dpogue21 says (much better than I could not - so thank you) in his imdb review, ""My next big problem is that Superman is raising a continent of kryptonite in space. It does not take the Simpson cartoon guy to say what\'s wrong with that. I do not know how many comics Bryan Singer has read, but when Superman is exposed to a small amount of kryptonite, he hardly has the strength to stay upright. Anyone who has had the idea to fly a large island with its greatest weakness in space is no longer dealing with projects related to Superman. The concept is as ridiculous as making a Dracula movie where the main character has a stake in his heart and still manages to fly a garlic spacecraft in the sun. Why not just Superman eating kryptonite? He can eat it and brush his teeth with him, then go sleep in kryptonite pajamas. It is no more absurd to have a continent of kryptonite hoisted into space, then let it fall into the atmosphere without burning back or splashing the central park when it hits the ground. \'\' Do I need to say more? I did not mean it. ** [...]'",0
"b'I was surprised that the editorial critics of this film treat it as another film, which is certainly NOT the case. I would describe it in different ways: as the film John Waters gave him the left hand to do; as a great sending of intense and heartbreaking dramatic dance films like Red Shoes, which stands out from the concept of ""camp"" without giving up the experience to stay consistent with the attitude; like a comedy that, if you get the joke, you will sometimes knock out laughing. There are times when I did not know which movie I was in, as the plot was about Flashdance and then Cinderella. But that\'s the kind of movie it is; he embraces operatic emotion and high melodrama, and although he recognizes the ordinary, he never becomes so. And it communicates magnificently the essential madness of all integrated and inclusive subcultures. (The incessant exhortations of the old guard to the hero not to engage in ""crowd motions"" are both absurd and quite typical of these subcultures, where the most sensible question is always that of knowing a strange and intense film, a film that keeps you constantly on the sidelines, and asks if you should take it seriously or as a kind of filmed comedy dream (think Rocky Horror Picture Show). cool is that you never have to decide, you can enjoy new aspects in multiple views.'",1
"b""Ridley Scott's alien must be considered one of the best thrillers ever put on celluloid. He ranks there with such films as Hitchcock's Psycho and Tod Browning's Dracula (1931). Alien is pretty much a haunted house classic, but instead of an old Victorian-era mansion, we have a giant, dark old cargo ship and the endless darkness of space itself. - This film is really a film B in the soul - with a very tense and intelligent scenario, and an exceptional direction of Ridley Scott. From the long opening sequence of Nostromo filling the screen, the public knows that it will be treated to an exceptionally shot film. Ridley Scott has always been known for his artistic direction and the biomechanical aspect of the Alien sets contributes to the feeling of horror and horror. This helps that Scott and his crew decide to engage the famous surrealist Swiss HR. Giger to design the look of sets and creatures. Anyone who has seen Giger's work can easily see his influence in Alien's scenography. Giger's final design for the main creature will be one of the best creations in film history. To this day, everyone knows what to imagine in their heads when someone mentions the words Alien and film together. The group of actors chosen for the film is excellent from top to bottom. Captain Tom Skerritt Dallas is a solid base on which the other characters are turning. The slow descent of Veronica Cartwright's character into hysteria - quite appropriate to the situation she and the rest of her teammates face - is like a barometer of the growing fear that runs through the entire movie from start to finish . The position of the cast must be Sigourney Weaver. The fact that this is her first major role in the cinema bodes well for what the public could expect from her during her career. His character of Lieutenant Ellen Ripley is about the antithesis of Lambert in Cartwright. Where Lambert slowly descended into paralyzing hysteria, Ripley slowly took control of the situation and became the de facto leader after Dallas. The general tone of the film owes a lot to the past. But instead of constant fears and red herrings, Scott slowly accumulated tension and dreaded long, slow shots of empty corridors and holds. For a movie that is considered one of the best horror movies ever made, Alien does not have many dark areas where the monster suddenly pops up. The monster will skip well-lit and spacious areas. Scott also used Spielberg's trick, which was to prevent the creature-monster from being on screen for a brief moment. It is only toward the very end of the end that we see Giger's Alien creature in all its splendor. This new edition of Alien dvd was finally accompanied by re-released scenes that add even more shock and horror to the film. I agree with Scott 's reasoning to delete the scenes. It slows the roller coaster, faster pace in the last part of the film. But in the comfort of his own home theater, these re-edited scenes are easier to integrate. The look of both the original film and the director's cut has been remastered and looks great, especially on a progressive scan compatible DVD player and a dedicated widescreen HDTV. Sound and music have also received a remastered 4-star treatment to better utilize the growing home theater systems. Alien is the most performing entry of the Alien Quadrilogy, though Aliens is a more exciting film. Alien takes the scifi horror genre and sets a standard that many still have to reach to this day.""",1
"b""Yes, I use all the SchoolHouse Rock interjections to sing his praises. I grew up with Schoolhouse Rock, but to be honest, I only thought about it when my husband and I laughed nostalgically for memorable songs like Conjunction Junction. Then he bought the 30th anniversary edition for our daughter (he was trying to qualify for free shipping when he bought the Belleville Triplets!). So, we can say that none of us has anticipated how fantastic this DVD would be - STILL! My 3 year old loves it, and I can not say enough great things about the creative lyrics that teach grammar, numbers, and body functioning (maybe I should). This is the DVD we have that I do not feel any apprehension about perverse or scary characters, dark tracings or questionable character influences (which are amazing in many videos for preschoolers). If you're wondering how to get this video, do not ask yourself more questions. It's a timeless winner that will not let you down (unless you're looking for dark intrigues and dubious character influences!)""",1

"b'The most recent burglary by a professional thief and his team goes terribly wrong and the organizer of the flawless plans gets more than he negotiated. The agents and gangsters chase him, but he remains calm under the pressure, thwarts the plans of the other parties and can still get away from the quagmire. This is a standard story format for action movies. It looks clich\xc3\xa9 & oacute; d and predictable, but it works well with a good pace in action and advice from the director. But ""7 Seconds"" does not have them. Wees Snipes plays the robber named Jack. Jack\'s failed flight to Bucharest, Romania, causes him further trouble because his girlfriend / partner is kidnapped during the shootings. He is hijacking a NATO military policeman (Tamzin Outhwaite who wears his British accent) after the chaos (and saves his life too) and embarks on an urban car chase in a familiar setting. History does not make much sense (why steal money from casinos in Romania?), But the first part of ""7 Seconds"" is fun with decent car stunts and a little humor. The actions are confusing, and you do not know where these running cars are going, but at least the stunts themselves are not bad. In the middle section of the film, boredom sets in, which stops the actions and begins to introduce superfluous characters, plus a twist of unnecessary plot. We do not need to see Wesley Snipes enter the station and put a briefcase on it. Or in fact, we do not care about the contents of the briefcase; and we do not even want to know if anything (whatever it is) is real or not. We want thrills and action, or fun dialogues. With the exception of a few martial arts stunts and slightly amusing jokes between Snipes and Outhwaite, ""7 Seconds"" does not have much to show, especially in its second part, where the film presents another sequence of stunts involving trams, but it\'s often tainted with criticism or criticism about live movies, but some are pretty good, offering 90-minute entertainment like Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren\'s movies. Unfortunately, Wesley Snipes, ""7 Seconds"", is not one of them.'",0

"b'The Crucible, based on the game of Arthur Miller, is an entertaining, if not always accurate, version of the events of 1692 at Salem Village. Having read many books on the subject, I still can not say for sure what led to so many men and women being accused of witchcraft and that it seems that so many girls are afflicted. One may wonder why it is only the females of Salem, and not the males, who seem to suffer from cries, catatonic states, hallucinations, & c. In any case, a conclusion that I could not the case Abigail Williams played by Winona Ryder whose advances are denied by the groom John Proctor (Daniel Day Lewis). The Proctors are also much younger in the movie than they were in real life. John was sixty when he was hanged. Elizabeth would have been in the mid-forties at the time of the trials. Pregnancy saved her from the hangman\'s rope. The film retains a good deal of precision in her treatment of the slave Tituba and her share in the case, as well as accusations against some ""troubled cities"" such as as a good nurse and Giles Corey who was pressed to death for refusing to testify. The scenes in the courtroom were the most dynamic and exciting, and recalled the period paintings of old books depicting trials with harsh and puritanical judges who showed accusing fingers. The film also did a good job of capturing this stifling and repressive scene of the 17th century and the costumes were of the highest quality. The best performances for me came from those who interpreted the different ministers and judges, especially Bruce Davison Danforth. Although it is not a perfectly accurate film, it still manages to capture one of the most significant events in American history. Reviewed by Tim Janson'",1

"b'This film begins quickly and quickly plunges the viewer into a very strange world, with dialogue and actions that make it difficult to follow. The important thing is to stay hooked and the pieces will begin to fit together. The film is based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, known for his very original imagination and which has come up with ideas for stories different from those of others. This is another of these original stories and takes the viewer on a crazy run. Fortunately, the pieces begin to fit together and do it with dramatic use of surround speakers and lots of onscreen action. The basic premise of the film is that technology has been developed to allow a crime to be seen before it happens, so that the police can intervene and stop the crime before it happens. Just as this crime prevention system is poised to spread nationwide, something is happening that changes everything. The character of Tom Cruise, a policeman by the name of John Anderton, is suddenly immersed in a situation that threatens his very life. His search for the truth provides the basis for this thrilling action film.'",1
"b'Some people in Germany have accused the film of trying to ""render harmless"" the crimes of the Third Reich. It could not be further from the truth, and I will explain why. Bruno Ganz plays Hitler the man. Hitler the man who loves his dog, who is kind to his secretary, who loves his friends and who spits at people he thinks betrayed, who tells those he cares to save himself, as he prepares take cyanide, shoot yourself and then be burned. He\'s a guy who, as long as he does not talk about Jews or world domination, would not be so difficult to live with. ALWAYS, it\'s still Hitler\'s monster. Being a vegetarian does not exempt him from being directly responsible for the death of millions of people or throwing the entire world into the war. Hitler, the two-dimensional monster, is inseparable from Hitler the three-dimensional man, and this is what this film reminds us of every time it hurts you, even if you know it and the film reminds you he was a monster. All the monsters of history - past, present and future - were and are human beings. We like to imagine Hitler as some kind of inhuman monster, but he was only human. Too human. That\'s why this movie makes people uncomfortable; it reminds them that the leader of men who seems to be a friendly man can turn out to be a monster if the right questions are never asked or ideas are never challenged. The warning is uncomfortable: you can not trust any ideologue on the face value. Not one, never. And / this / is the real import of this film, if ""Never Again"" has to have some sort of real meaning next to a slogan. If I were a history teacher, I would show this film followed by / Schindler\'s List /. Both are equally true, and equally important aspects of the story: all this horror comes from mere humans.'",1

"b'I am and I am always a loyal fan of Xena and Gabrielle. Let me remind those who loved the end of something. Real life is full of sadness, misery, loss and tragedy. We watch TV and movies to escape reality. Xena was a tragic figure at the beginning of her life. She killed for little or no reason. But she saw that she was wrong. She changed her habits and fought for justice. There is no way to bring the dead back to life. But Xena repented and dedicated her life to fighting for good. She risked her life many times to save the lives of countless others. (Let those who have not sinned throw the first stone) We need a heroine like Xena. We want to see that those who win the ""white hats"" and the bad guys in the ""black hats"" lose. I know that reality does not work that way many times. But Xena was different. It\'s special I think it\'s very scary, very tragic and pathetic that Xena had to die. And if dying was not enough, beheading it made me turn my stomach. I own the whole series.

"b""Among the many interpretations of this piece that I saw on stage and on the screen, it's the best - a strong affirmation given the many excellent actors attracted by the powerful characters of Tennessee Williams (eg, Katherine Hepburn and Sam Waterston). John Malkovich seems to be born to play Tom, the artist torn between family duties and adventure. Malkovich's intense and punchy style is an ideal match for Williams' play, in which text and poetry dominate. His performance in this role is the most convincing of all I've seen, and avoids the trap of allowing Tom to become too gloomy and self-absorbed. Joanne Woodward is also perfect as Amanda, who, although deceived, narrow and even silly, reunites her family with her unique blend of courage and desperation. Karen Allen and James Naughton also capture what I think Williams had to imagine in the characters Laura Wingfield and the gentlemen, and both generate real chemistry in the pivot scene with the glass unicorn. It is a must for anyone interested in American theater.""",1

There was no pleasure in this movie at all. The story made no sense, the actors were very stiff and none of the characters seemed to care about the other characters. At one point in the movie, Christian Slater says, ""I just killed my long-time friend,"" in the same way that you would say ""I just spilled my coffee on a pair of stained pants, that I was about to to throw away"" . I guess that could sum up the whole movie. The actors did not seem to care, the director did not seem to care, the publishers did not seem to care, in fact the only actor who really seemed to do a decent job was the animators who animated the film.

"b""It seems that good movies inspire remakes. As to whether they are & quot; inspired & quot; remakes is always open to the question. Both versions of The Italian Job have unique features that make them interesting, but for simple and fun scenes (with the exception of Ed Norton in the remake that seems to be trapped in a movie he does not like no), 1969 's The Italian job is my personal choice. Mark Wahlberg can not hold a candle (and is not really an actor frankly) to Michael Caine in the original movie. There are almost as many things that make this classic movie turn because there are seconds on a clock. The plot focuses more on the getaway than on the capers. This unique twist turned the shape on his head. The terrific cast (including the late Noel Coward in his latest onscreen appearance and, of all people, Benny Hill!) Features the wonderful Michael Caine in mind. The late Peter Collinson brings to life what could have been, despite his intrigues, a routine film. Collinson is in a way a cult director who died relatively young before he could fully fulfill his promise as a director. I would also recommend his classic cult psychological thriller, Straight On Till Morning, which became available on DVD last year. Although embarrassed by the editing conventions and visual conventions of the mid 70's, Morning does more than bend to the explotive movies of the time. Completing the film is a commentary track featuring the film's original producer as well as a number of great extras. It 's great to have this minor classic finally restored to its good aspect ratio.

Although left and Lois passes to another man, love is still there. So, of course, there's the battle going on between Lex Luthor and Superman, so it's like having two good stories in a movie! There is an emotional chemistry in this movie that is undeniable. You can actually feel what Superman goes through throughout the movie, both good and bad.

"b'Director Jon Reiss and producer Tracy Wares take us on a world tour of graffiti in ""Bomb It"". The film supports graffiti more than against him, but he interviews people whose mission is to rid neighborhoods of graffiti as well as graffiti artists on 4 continents. There is an undercurrent of these issues that should decide what we are looking at in public spaces, a provocative but not really the center of the film. ""Bomb It"" covers many things in the history and scope of graffiti art, but wisely, because we can see that graffiti artists are not all alike. Graffiti has evolved over time and its purpose is different in different cultures and subcultures. ""Bomb It"" begins by interviewing Cornbread, a Philadelphian whose campaign to label everything with his nickname in 1967 could make him the first modern graffiti artist. The film avoids the ""who did what"" debate but follows the progression from the simple to the more elaborate lettering that led the graffiti transformation from a lower-class anti-cultural movement to a broader artistic movement. Graffiti writers in New York, in the 1970s and 1980s, talk about their exploits before the city begins to aggressively clean graffiti on public property. Other cities whose artists are featured are: Paris, France; Amsterdam, Netherlands; London, United Kingdom; Berlin, Germany; Barcelona, \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bSpain; Cape Town, South Africa; S\xc3\xa3o Paulo, Brazil; Tokyo, Japan; and in Los Angeles, United States. I have always thought of graffiti as a means of frustration, of energy, but above all of the irresponsibility of young people who attack what they perceive as the status quo. Now I have learned that graffiti has a different meaning in different cultures. In South Africa, graffiti was a tool for political change. In Los Angeles, he was part of the Chicano movement and took the trap of a lifestyle in some neighborhoods. In some cultures, the focus is more on the creation of works of art in public spaces than on counterculture. Unsurprisingly, these artists have a less adversarial relationship with communities and the law. The fact is that graffiti and vandalism have a profound effect on the rate of more serious crimes. And many of the interviewed artists portray themselves as extremely selfish people who give themselves hope to others because their lives are not what they would like. On the other hand, it can not be denied that graffiti is sometimes an improvement over dismal and decaying buildings, or that artists are talented, or that some opponents of graffiti are politically undeclared. ""Bomb It"" is an introduction to graffiti and its controversies showing us art, ideas and differences of opinion. The DVD (Docurama 2008): There are 3 featurettes and a comment on the features. In ""Behind the Scenes"" (14 min), director Jon Reiss talks about the genesis of the project, filming in different nations, editing the film and some themes.

But there are also Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney Jr., both in the roles that made them famous and have both played them quite directly, making it a classic. This is the original classic that inspired hundreds of imitations, from Bowery Boys to Scooby-Doo. It's horror / comedy at its peak - it can not be done better. It is a fact that the legendary rock guitarist Jerry Garcia considered this film as his favorite film (seriously) and for a very good reason. For the atmosphere, classic movie monsters and hilarity, this movie is the best of all time. it actually deserves six stars, but you can only give five. This is the Casablanca of horror / comedy.

""The main character is therefore receiving phone calls and receiving messages from random people on his machine, asking for his help, because some psychopaths have a gun at the head of the victims ... which leads him to be the No. 1 suspect. and he must try to understand everything to prove his innocence.

"b'You will not regret it ! If I had known how entertaining and intelligent this film was, I would have taken my son to see him at the theater. I\'m pretty tired of the & quot; Disney Formula & quot; and this animated film has revitalized my expectations for the company. The voices are a riot of the fabulous Eartha Kitt as the hilarious villain of his sidekick Kronk (Patrtick ""Putty"" Warburton) and his condescending but humorous Spade. Disney rejects sentimentality in this film to emphasize humor and wit. A good example is the representation of Pacha\'s pregnant woman at home alone with two young children who intelligently use her children to thwart the antagonists. Surprising and extremely funny. As banal as it may seem, this film ""works on many levels"" providing intelligent humor for adults with great pictures and jokes for children, and the theme of kindness and altruism is done with unusual subtlety without losing the message I am extremely pleased with my purchase and am happy to have reviewed a premise that seemed absurd to enjoy one of Disney\'s most creative movies in a long time.'",1

"b""It's been years since you did not even need to be a big fan of tabloids to follow Britney Spears. His antics did not extend to all the covers of the magazine, but were even broadcast in national TV news! You also do not need to be a genius to understand that half of the things in these magazines did not look very good, though. Finally, Britney shows us what it's like to be the most famous celebrity in the world. Some critics say it does not really explain everything (why exactly does it shave its head, how did this guy take control of his life?) Enough - can we at least allow him to keep some secrets for herself? You're probably a fan of Britney if you look at it, so I doubt that I have to convince you that his music is great.

"b'As for the plot, here\'s what the back of the box says: ""Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) is a private researcher specializing in inexplicable supernatural phenomena. His business plunges into the dark corners of the world, searching for the truth in the hidden vestiges of ancient civilizations. Now, the greatest mystery of his past is about to become the most dangerous case he has ever faced. With the help of his ex-girlfriend, archeologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid), and his fierce rival, government agent Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff), Edward is about to learn that it\'s It\'s not because t means it can not kill you! ""According to the character of Carnby, the fear of the dark is what keeps us alive. Unfortunately, the fear of crappy movies does not prevent us from praising them. Despite the horrible reviews, I decided to give in to the temptation to rent Alone In The Dark (I had a free rental, so I thought there could be no loss). It was even worse than I expected ... First, creatures that are liberated from the depths of darkness - or any other clich\xc3\xa9 object in history - are pathetic CGI dino-beasts. Something interesting, scary or just ""cool"" about them? Nope . Just useless computer-generated monsters that fail to entertain the public in any way. For two, the acting is horrible. Seeing Tara Reid on the main credits of the DVD made me roll my eyes, but seeing her try to play the role of archaeologist in a sci-fi action movie just made me laugh. Christian Slater is the only decent mid-actor, but that is not enough to cover the rest. And for three, the film is terribly boring, with few action scenes. Oh, of course, some unknown bumps here and there, creatures flashing across the screen, and a little gore is included. But the real action? Very little . The small amounts of action he has included are the reason why I gave two stars to this worst. I hate to see a movie suffer, but this one deserves it. In conclusion, do not make the same mistakes as most of these critics by praising the movie, knowing how terrible it must be. Just trust the ratings on this one. This will save you money and time.'",0

I have read the somewhat negative reviews of other guests, but I am not in the best shape, so I thought it would be good for me. FALSE! First of all, the DVD is short, about 45 minutes from beginning to end. You only get a dance routine, which is divided into four parts. I was expecting fun dance music (similar to cheerleaders), and it was a techno-lame track. I also found that some girls' voices were particularly boring. I did not feel energized or as if I had burned calories. In short, this product was a big disappointment for me.""",0
"b""I bought the ungraded director's cut from this movie with a lot of anticipation. I loved the Pitch Black theatrical release. It's one of my favorite sci-fi movies, hands down. But the director's cup not ranked? Is a waste of money. The additions to the movie were so rare and so subtle that I barely noticed them. The not evaluated part? More violence? Significantly. More discussion? More bare skin? No, neither one nor the other. And the extras? Are almost nonexistent. There is nothing on this DVD that I did not have on the first, except a hype about the rest, and not even very convincing. Seriously, if you already own this movie on DVD, do not waste your money on this reissue. If you do not have this movie on DVD, see if you can find the original version. At least he has theater trailers.""",0
"b""I can not really tell a joke. A bad joke is not funny, no matter who says it, but someone like me can make a bad joke. You have to tell a story as well and, in the case of a well-filmed film, be interesting. The problem with AntiTrust is that it's not a very well-written tale. It's nice to watch, but has no electricity or soul. Milo [Ryan Phillippe] is a computer genius. Upon leaving college, he plans to start a business with friends in a garage, just as their computer heroes did twenty years ago. They plan to make their mark in cyberspace. One day, apparently unannounced, Gary Winston [Tim Robbins] asked Milo and his best friend to come to work for his giant multinational company. It seems that Winston is about to launch a computer program that will revolutionize communications, but it needs some good geeks to make it operational. The friend, a wise young man, decides to stick to his original plan, but Milo gets sucked. With his girlfriend Alice [Claire Forlani], he packs his bags and moves to Portland, Oregon, where Winve de Nurve is located. It does not take long for Milo to suspect that Winston will literally kill to get what he wants. Breakthroughs in programming the new product always seem to happen just after the mysterious death of a brilliant programmer. One of the problems of the film is related to the casting. Tim Robbins is just like Winston, making him look and act like Bill Gates, it's a bit scary. Ryan Phillippe, however, I can not buy any kind of genius. He has done a good job in the past, playing roles of sociopath [Cruel Intentions], psychopath [The Way of the Gun] and party party [54]. But a computer scientist? I do not think so. Rachael Lee Cook is just as incredible as Lisa, another programmer. Claire Forlani, who could be a star someday soon, is fine like Alice, but it's a role that falls short of her abilities. AntiTrust belongs to the paranoid thriller genre. It is the one in which only the hero has understood a diabolical plot. Until the end of the film, the other characters are almost always blind to the truth and tend to believe that the hero is simply stressed. The rear window of Alfred Hitchcock is a classic example of this type of film. To succeed, the film must bring the public to care about the protagonist. This must relate to it This does not happen in AntiTrust. Milo is too bland and lame to interest us. It's one of those cases where, if we're dealing with someone, it's the bad guy, Winston. At least he is quick-witted and somewhat humorous. You know that a movie is in trouble when we start looking for the bad guy.""",0
"b'This is a very well done and beautifully shot suite. The opening sequence and sequences with snipers indiscriminately shooting at the fleeing crowd were very memorable and well executed. However, I was completely confused by the simplicity with which the father could access his wife who was supposed to be in quarantine. I know there are often loopholes in the logic and suspensions of disbelief in many movies and I am guilty of succumbing to some of them. But for me, it was very obvious. To shout loudly, the US military was completely incompetent or the filmmakers did not think it would be so blatant for the public. Who in their good spirit does not put the mother in quarantine with at least a guard at the door and even less a nurse or a technician who monitors her? ? ? ? ? ? Instead, the installation was deserted. It was too simple for the father to access with a pass card or not. If a person was still alive 28 weeks later without any symptoms in a quarantine zone in the real world, that person would be locked up and the video would be monitored 24 hours a day for days or weeks to find out how survived and how she was ""immune"" against this virus. Such precautions would never be taken lightly, especially when you\'re dealing with a virus that has virtually wiped out a whole country! If they did not have strict protocols, we would have been eliminated like a race a long time ago. The suspension of disbelief in this film really prevented me from enjoying a rather good movie.'",0
"b""This film is a must - a movie that you can watch at least once a year. He is entertaining with great performances by Sig Weaver and Melanie Griffith. Although Melanie is a very average actor, her style works in this movie. The type of character required, i.e. said blonde, she just wanted to be herself really. On top of that, her baby voice works for the role. Working Girl is a beautiful comedy focusing on an improbable climb, but when you think about it, it shows that everyone can get where they want, if they have the determination and the courage. It's a good message to convey, I feel it. Working Girl could have made Melanie a big star but that did not open the doors she thought. She may have had more roles after that, but none of them was worth watching! I'm referring to flops like Bonfire Vanities, Stormy Monday (simple urgh!), Shining Through and one with my ex-husband Don Johnson - the title escapes me. I think that Melanie 's inability to get rid of that little voice really killed her career.""",1

Paul Mehling does he know? There is no theory in this video at all ... NOTHING He does not tell you when to play the scale and the trills, etc. it shows you, or how they relate to chords, or whatever, there is no review of the rhythm placement of solo notes (that would be the SWING part of the gypsy swing guitar). There\'s no review of what Django\'s scales preferred to what chords, nothing at all. & quot; There is no dissection or tearing of the Djangos style, as another critic has suggested. Nothing of the kind . Nor is it an introduction to jazz improvisation in my opinion. The sad thing is that this video could be so much more. Paul is obviously an excellent player and knows the style.

NMTZ is definitely harder than Shred 30 days! I like the variety of movements and this workout requires more repetitions with lighter weights. It is also good that you can choose to read the entire workout or select different segments from the menu.

Christian Slater is a good actor and the movie seemed to have a decent budget for the creatures, which were pretty well animated, but apart from these two points, this film did not qualify for a ""direct chain of science fiction"". \'\' Liberation. There was no pleasure in this movie at all. The story made no sense, the actors were very stiff and none of the characters seemed to care about the other characters. At one point in the movie, Christian Slater says, ""I just killed my long-time friend,"" in the same way that you would say ""I just spilled my coffee on a pair of stained pants, that I was about to to throw away"" . I guess that could sum up the whole movie. The actors did not seem to care, the director did not seem to care, the publishers did not seem to care, in fact the only actor who really seemed to do a decent job was the animators who animated the film. After watching this movie, I felt very sad for Christian Slater. His career must be completely over now. I\'m depressed . It\'s time to look at Madagascar and cheer me up.'",0

However, this film is a dramatic deviation and has a story without thoughts decorated with nonsense. In short, Thomas accidentally drifts onto an island five miles off the Brendam wharves. Despite the FIVE MILE submarine tunnel linking Sodor to Misty Island and the proximity of the shore, none have seen Misty Island. Thomas meets new trains on the foggy island (Dash, Bash and Ferdinand) that were sent into exile on the island for not being really useful and together they work hard to exploit an endangered tree to build a first aid station All is well in the end, but they waste valuable time for logistical reasons to find some of the people who were looking for Thomas before fleeing (if that is understandable). At least writers should have known that it was a horrible story. In addition, this story tells the story of the captain (a boat) who is the only one to have an English accent since all seafarers have English accents. Finally, Hit Entertainment, which brings together Thomas\'s films, makes another logistical challenge for the movie by removing the ""menu"" button function, bypassing previews only by pressing the ""jump"" button a million times.

The third season features Medusa, a Caveman, The Flying Dutchman, The Abominable Snowman, a fire-breathing dinosaur, a two-headed dinosaur, and a beetle that hurts you! Logic, continuity and characterization all come out of the window. Sleestak and Chaka speak, Enik does stupid things in the name of ""logic"". The only thing better in this season is the acting game.

"b""After being very disappointed by Spirited Killer, I set my expectations much lower for this movie. Unfortunately, it's even worse than Spirited Killer. The story is not really worth it. Basically, there's a guy who knows where a gemstone is. An evil general and his men want the stone and try to get it. There is also a group of good guys trying to find the guy who knows where the stone is. It's history. Tony Jaa plays one of the villains and looks great in his 2 fight scenes, but all the other fights are really bad. Some of the stunts are good, but not on par with most of Panna Rittikrai's other films. The good guys have a type of Rambo at their side and he drags the film somehow because his movements are very slow. But overall, the main reason why this movie is so bad is that there is not a lot of fights. I can bear a bad story as long as the fighting is good, but this movie does not provide it. Even the grand finale is not worth it. There are decent explosions, but nothing can be excited. This film really makes you appreciate how much effort has been devoted to Panna's 2 Born to Fight films. The quality of the image is surprisingly good (well, it's good for Videoasia). There is a dub track in English HORRIBLE, but fortunately there is also an original language track and subtitles. The only reason this 2-disc DVD gets a 1-star rating about Tom Yum Goong. No new information here, but as he talks, they're showing a really cool demo he's done on a TV show. 6 minute interview with Jaa talking about her inspiration for getting into movies and some other interesting topics. TV show with Prachya Pinkaew, Jaa, Panna and Petchtai Wongkamlao. Slightly entertaining demonstration and 5 minute interview that Jaa did in Hong Kong. Good things here, but nothing you've ever seen if you're a Jaa fan with a 22-minute interview with the producer of Pechpanna Films and a director / actor for the company. Super interview! They talk about really cool things, like a new Thai movie called The Brave. It's not subtitled and the dubbing is really cheesy, but it makes it more enjoyable (at least for me). And there are good scenes of action mixed with the interview. Interview with Tony Jaa It seems they are just trying to stack special features with this. The only thing you need to talk about is a 1-minute demonstration they present at the end of the interview. An interview with Christoph Kluppel, a great German Rambo guy who plays Battle Warrior. He talks about his film career. I guess it would be interesting if I was a fan of him.""",0

We see then the contrasting impact of the meeting on the two boys - Granny growing up in trust and Ste struggling to reconcile her sexuality with her status as ""one of the guys"" and scared that her father and brother are discovering him. The main motive of the film is ""coming soon"" and visually the film is subtly subtle.The producer Tony Garnett was a major television producer and there is a slight impression of television on the images, especially the scenes of the dark area but the scenes will be enlivened by a rainbow and brighten the area with window baskets, etc. It is never a pure delirium of social realism and the sense of unreality is sometimes quite deliberate. The main actors are not guys in the Hollywood sense. k idents in looks and aspirations, making it an easy-to-understand movie for gay teens.

"b'The ""Prisoner of Zenda"" of 1922 is certainly one of the best silent films ever made. His main actors knew better than moving too much and there was obviously a very competent director in Rex Ingram. Even if the plot, the costumes and the sets are straight out of an operetta, the players are mostly natural, which shows that the advent of sound is not the result of a good action. Even Ramon Navarro, Hentzau\'s wicked Rupert, is much more than a beautiful face as he turns his role into an animated tour de force. The photo begins in the mansion of English Rudolph Rassendyll. on the extremely beautiful eyes of Lewis Stone, a 43-year-old veteran who looks, in many other ways, to a rather ordinary middle-aged man in good physical condition. But of course, Stone\'s histrionic talent is nothing ordinary and, in addition, he has all the charm that made him love as Judge Hardy about 15 years later in the series ""Andy Hardy"". Rassendyll decides to attend the coronation of his cousin Rudolph of Ruritania [of which he could be the twin] and finds his relative as a disorder dispelled. Lewis Stone plays both roles, needless to say. The weak king has an ambitious but evil brother, Duke Michael, who plots to seize the throne and kill Rudolph. On the eve of the coronation, the duke arranges for his brother to be drugged so that he is not able to attend the ceremony. As a result, the King\'s loyalists persuaded Briton Rassendyll to take his place for a day and prevent Michael from following his path. Rudolph has a beautiful fianc\xc3\xa9e played by the bright Alice Terry. The couple is not very useful to each other, but it is a popular princess that could serve to reinforce the unstable position of Rudolph. However, Rassendyll and the charming girl are taking each other at once and, feeling an unexpected change in her, the princess no longer sees her role of future queen as a mere duty. Of course, the plot thickens and there is another woman involved, played by the seductive but less natural actress Barbara La Marr. Rudolph Rassendyll can not return to England after the coronation but must stay to help save his endangered royal cousin. There are also a lot of skull games and sword games. All this gives rise to a fascinating film and it is a revelation to see how much a younger and more juicy version of the old Judge Hardy is effective in the scenes of love. Pretty sexy! It is probably no coincidence that the actor who played the dual role in the next ""Prisoner of Zenda"", Ronald Colman, looked a lot like Lewis Stone.'",1
"b'When I saw the trailer for & quot; From Hell & quot; I was naturally ecstatic. Based on the graphic novel of the same name, written by Alan Moore, I had high hopes for this one. Judging by the previews, it seemed like the Hughes brothers would do justice. But alas, as the cinematographic adaptations of books often go, they slaughtered them. Let\'s start with the character of Johnny Depp, Inspector Abberline. They go from an honest and hardworking detective who slowly develops feelings for a young prostitute to a clairvoyant addicted to opium who falls head over heels in love with the aforementioned prostitute (Heather Graham). And speaking of Heather Graham, could they have made a more horrible choice for a 19th century prostitute? The other prostitutes in the movie look as they should (ugly), but Graham remains like a sore thumb. As for history, this butchery is typical of Hollywood movies. The book focuses on the character of Jack the Ripper more than anyone in the story. In fact, it was revealed in Chapter 2! That made it so fascinating: the book went into the killer \'s head and tried to explain the motives behind his horrific murders, in addition to the obvious evidence presented in the film. He deconstructed and analyzed a really twisted mind and tried to convey how, according to Alan Moore, ""The human experience went to the end ... then passed."" The film turns into a typical polar, leaving you guessing until it is revealed at the very end.Anyway, I have been talking for a long time.See the movie if you want - for pure entertainment you will probably enjoy it. if you want a richly textured and fascinating, albeit fictitious, story about one of the most notorious serial killers of all time, read the book.'",0
"b""I remember it like it was yesterday. I was 24 years old when this movie came out and lived in Miami Florida. I had long hair (really long) and went out with an absolute hottie. So, on the weekend of the release of this movie, my girlfriend took me to this movie. In fact, it's a group of us, three couples and all the guys have been dragged by their girlfriends. The 24-year-old guy with long hair and heavy metal music is not one to enjoy a girls movie, so none of us was happy to be here. To make the film a little more pleasant, we were in a slightly modified state. '' But this little film conquered us! And none of us was single at the time either. I also have a lot of links with the character of Matt Dillon because that is exactly how I lived my life at the time. I can not add anything more than others have said, the movie works so well because it is not sober. it's not forced, it's not a clich\xc3\xa9, and it's not lame. There was just something so honest and natural in the movie. And although at the time, I was seriously upset by the advent of grunge music that killed the precious heavy metal that I loved so much, I ended up enjoying music too. It was a real grunge, before the music companies turned to the top 40 of the marketed shit, and before the clothing manufacturers / manufacturers turned the clothes of thrift stores into expensive, high-end branded clothes. This really sparked my interest in Seattle and I remember wanting to move for a few years after seeing this movie (never done). As my title says, this is a girls movie that guys will like the trappings of the typical chick movie. The acting and writing are excellent, as are the music and the city of Seattle. I have since seen the film in an unaltered state and it has lost none of its charm, its originality and its innocence. This film captures a fun, innocent, carefree, fresh and exciting time before the dotcom bubble before 9/11, before the record price of gasoline and before the implosion of our entire economy. Not only do the 20 or so people today do not have a movie like Singles to show, but they do not have a lot of future either.""",1
"b'An aging stripper exerts great power over others with the help of a mysterious amulet in SIN, YOU SINNERS. The word ""aging"" seems to be a nice way to say it. In many ways, Mama\'s 30-year lease on the Middle Ages will soon expire, though that does not seem to threaten his grip on manager Dave and his daughter. The saints do not preserve us either, it prevents them from creaking and beating every 15 minutes or so. Dave, the mom bought and paid for a boy\'s toy, is his director and bongo drum accompanist when she pursues her second job as a spiritualist waving amulets and specializes in stalking the rich. Dave also has a crush on the girl, and the 20-year-old has a crush on Dave, but neither can mess with a hormone while mom is wearing the amulet. Even though Mama, the saints preserve us, can shake and shake her tight shirt with the bangs on the top, it\'s not really a blue film. Beyond the terrible, I do not know what it is or how to explain it. The second screamer on this DVD, the reason I chose it in the first place, is the vehicle scripted and performed by Lenny Bruce (the only real movie he\'s ever been in) DANCE HALL RACKET. This one speaks of a dance hall which defeats its client and dancers of the hall who foe the direction. Bruce is revered by comedians standing as a forward-thinking, current and innovative genius. It may be true, but his first film credited is not up to par. Not standing, no jokes, no ha-ha in this one. It stinks . It does not help that the impression of transfer was bad, and at some point between 1953 and today, someone pulled out all the nudie briefs in the girls\' locker room. Losing the quick glance is not easy, but it ruins the soundtrack and dialogue and makes some conversations even more ridiculous than I think. Two stinky for the price of one. Not recommended as entertainment, although it\'s probably the best chance to see Lenny Bruce walk and talk. If this does not work for you, avoid this dvd like the plague.'",0

"b'While 1952\'s ""Singin \'in the Rain"" is unquestionably the most successful musical film, I think this classic from 1949 is a perfect illustration of what MGM produced during Hollywood\'s Golden Age, when the talents were at their peak. Co-directed by 25-year-old Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen in his first feature film, the film has endless energy thanks to the remarkable choreography of Kelly and Donen, the seamless blend of Leonard Bernstein\'s music with Les compositions original works by Roger Edens, composer of studio music, and the exuberance of the performers. Written by the esteemed team of Betty Comden and Adolph Green, the decreed plot is limited to three sailors - Gabey, Chip and Ozzie - in 24 hours. New York City and the women they meet and romance. Based on a subway poster, Gabey falls in love with Miss Turnstiles and spends her time looking for her. Ozzie, who suffers from phobia, finds a love affair with Claire, a student in anthropology, while the shy Chip focuses on the visits despite the persistent attentions of the aggressive taxi driver Hildy. The closest story to dramatic tension is in the deceptions around Miss Turnstiles, who is not the big celebrity Gabey presumes to be an aspiring ballerina named Ivy, who has to work at night as an exotic dancer at Coney Island. . is obviously at its best when it is centered on the musical sequences - starting with the actual places used for ""New York, New York"" by establishing the energetic arrival of the sailors, continuing with the elaborate number ""Prehistoric Man"" at the Museum of Natural History and hopping through the set of titles with the top six singing and dancing at the top of the Empire State Building. Everyone has a chance to shine, although, like Gabey, Gene Kelly clearly dominates with his gracious athleticism. As Chip, Frank Sinatra eclipsed, sings especially in front of Betty Garrett, which admirably contains her Hildy brew. Although it is hardly credible as an academic type, Ann Miller manages to impressively exploit ""the prehistoric man"" and the face of Jules. Munshin mostly provides comedies like Ozzie. When she dances rather than deceiving Gabey, Vera-Ellen dazzles Ivy, from the fantastic ""Miss Turnstiles Ballet"" to her superb duets with Kelly on ""Main Street"" and ""A Day in New York Ballet"". . The only negative note is the condescending attitude towards Lucy, the roommate with the sinister voice of Hildy (played with enthusiasm by the original Gladys Kravitz of ""Bewitched"", Alice Pearce). The color-saturated cinematography of Harold Rosson was very well maintained in the print transfer on the 2000 DVD, although the only extra is the now dilapidated theater trailer.'",1
"b""My kids love this movie and watch it while sleeping with their friends. Don Knotts plays Luther Hegg, a shy typographer in a small town in the center west (Rachel, Kansas).

Vivian Vance's ex-husband, Phil Ober, plays the murderer and the old ladies at the pension are hilarious. Reta Shaw is very funny as the head of the Psychic Society and Vic Muzzy's musical score is scary.

""Animal, Vegetable Miracle"" and ""In Defense of Food"", among others. However, this film is more than the sum of these books and this film. Food Inc. is an extremely well-done documentary partly because of the personal stories told by the interviewees, as well as hidden images of the camera. I was particularly impressed by what happens to farmers. The material is so well studied and presented. Several aspects of food production, marketing and consumption are covered.

"b""The adventures of three girls in show business. ZIEGFELD GIRL is a huge behind-the-scenes musical in which MGM has poured tons of talent; He also marked the first mission of Pandro S. Berman in this studio after his years of success at RKO. The reason why Jimmy Stewart received the highest rating for this rather uneven but entertaining film is a mystery - his role is virtually minor. Robert Z. Leonard did the two and a half hours of combat, triumph, pain, and music, but the two big production numbers, MINNIE FROM TRINIDAD and YOU, emerged from a dream, were the work of the magician of cinematic choreography. Busby Berkeley. Judy is as darling as Susan Gallagher and her scenes with her Irish pop (Charles Winninger) are performed realistically. I felt that Lana Turner's performance was a little artificial and incompetent in her playing technique. She plays Sheila who succumbs to the bottle. As Sandra, Lamarr is surprisingly beautiful, but his game does not linger long in the memory! Jimmy Stewart would join the army before the premiere of this film; he would not make another film before 1946; It was a bunk (I was joking) entitled IT IS A WONDERFUL LIFE.""",1
"b""This review is for the DVD edition of the movie Criterion COllection. The original French title of the film is & quot; Rifiif In Men & quot; which translates to & quot; Problem with men & quot; The film is really good and speaks of several men trying to break into a jewelery store, open the safe and escape, without sounding the alarm. Several scenes have been imitated in other films: notably Mission Impossible and the remake of the movie Italain Job. Many scenes are exciting and the break-in scene is very exciting. This half-hour scene also contains no dialogue, making it one of the longest, if not the longest, without dialogue in a film with dialogue. This is without a doubt one of the best integration films I have seen and which certainly deserves an exit from Criterion Collection. There are also several special features. There is a theatrical trailer, Production stills and notes, a video interview with director Jules Dassin, who also personally affixed this edition, and drawings by Alexandre Trauner. There is also an optional English soundtrack for those who are disturbed by a foreign language with subtitles. Anyway, it's a movie that should not be missed by any fan of burglary movies!""",1
"b""This is a dark, scary and mysterious film in which the writer did not go too far with the plot. Often, in films like this, the authors make the ultimate mystery solution incredibly complicated and unrealistic. This film, on the other hand, is complex enough to make it intriguing, while obtaining a high score on realism. Although I liked this film, I will say that Sean Connery is one of the main reasons. Without him, the film would probably lose a star. This is one of his best performances. F. Murray Abraham is also at his best, as the incredibly wicked inquisitioner. Christian Slater is not bad. The other actors of the film seem to have been discovered during a traveling freak show where they had the best makeup artist. What a strange group! The film does not exceed the gore and depicts very little violence. Torture and murder usually occur off-screen. The Catholic Church definitely has a black eye here. All monks and clergy (apart from Sean C.) are portrayed as being at least three of the following: evil, ulgy, sexually active (heterosexual and gay), and generally very stupid. However, I like to think that many things are due to the 14th century when the mystery occurs and that, consequently, things were much more primitive. Yet Catholics can be offended if they are not already insensitive to any other film featuring the Catholic clergy. The mystery itself is a good movie that should make you guess. Sean Connery is the only logical person in the movie and he is your guide to the solution. I enjoyed the movie, as I think most will do. Just manage your expectations because it's a good movie, but not one of the best.""",1

It\'s just beautiful. The whole film is also remarkable, but the last scene before the final figure of the real fair Lana Turner steals the film. In this scene, she is deadly ill and leaves the theater while Tony Martin sings: ""You came out of a dream. \'\' In her trademark jeste in the top of the stairwell, with no dialog box just music, she thinks to be this beautiful girl from Ziegfield again and goes down the stairs.

"b'""Elvis: it\'s like that"" captures King Presley at an interesting crossroads of his career. With his real talents largely wasted after many years in Hollywood, Elvis found himself stolen from ""The King of Rock and Roll"" by The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. This documentary, shot in the summer of 1970 while preparing for an engagement at the International Hotel in Las Vegas, finds Elvis ready and able to demand his throne! The documentary shows him at the age of 35, in shape and size, and has a lot of fun! See Elvis having fun - it\'s a joy in itself! Elvis had a keen sense of music and his craft. He was expecting a lot of people he was working with; and he knew exactly how to make the most of everyone. It is obvious here that Elvis enjoyed working with his band and his backup singers; and they enjoyed working with him. Elvis criticized in a sweet and funny way. When his group struggles with the central part of Bridge Over Troubled Water, Elvis comments, ""If that\'s the way it is, it\'s okay, but we do not need to point it out. `` The concert sequence itself proves that Elvis could very well have been the most hardworking show-business man. It also proves that Elvis had ""that"" - that indefinable and often indescribable X factor (or in his case, factors) that makes the difference between an artist and a superstar. Elvis was a superstar with a major ""S"" - with a powerful combination of charisma, sex appeal, musical sense and showmanship. Elvis\'s charisma, in particular, burns the scene quite enough. Elvis does everything to please his audience. During a long rendition of ""Love Me Tender"", he goes out into the audience, embracing as many women as possible and shaking hands with as many men as possible. He sings a Greatest Hits Medley largely for laughs (change the lyrics to ""forget the past, before I give you a # #"").

When he is congratulated on a wonderful show, Elvis modestly responds, ""Well, it was a sweaty show.

"b'If you have never seen a movie to come, this is the one you need. One of the most critically acclaimed gay movies is a sensitive, thoughtful, tender and sweet story with a superb score of Mama Cass. The film, directed by Hettie McDonald and based on the script of gay writer Jonathan Harvey, portrays the relationships of people in a large real estate complex located east of London (I was physically there). Especially for the British of the low-income working class, the film revolves around three families, all broken homes. Ste, coming from a father and a family brother Jaime, a mother and a boyfriend family; and Leah, a British black girl with her mother. The story is the development of a love affair between two boys, Ste (played by Scott Neal) and Jaime (played by Glenn Berry). They live next to each other. They are both 16 years old (also in real life to maintain accuracy). It is also the story of Leah, sometimes drug addict, struggling, dropout. She is a catalyst with her obsession with the music of Mama Cass, she constantly sings her songs and makes a lot of noise around the apartments. I read messages in this chat room about her, without understanding why she is the movie. His character contributes to the greatness of the film.Ste was beaten several times by his father and brother. He takes refuge with Jaime. Jaime\'s mother, Sandra (superbly performed by Linda Henry). She loves Jaime very much and left her husband because of physical violence. She is a tough, intelligent, caring and loving woman who runs the local bar / club in this apartment complex. She feels sorry for Ste and takes her away. Ste must sleep in Jaime\'s bed or in a couch. Then Jaime kisses Ste.There is a trip to a local gay bar, no more kisses in the woods. Sandra discovers that her son has lied to him about his love for Ste. She is informed by the school principal that Jaime is being teased and is called ""fag"". And the film arrives in its last moments. Mama Cass\' s music is played late at night when it is high and almost fallen from the balcony of the building, and Ste discovers that Sandra knows them. Better manage a pub in another part of East London, she says goodbye to her boyfriend and gets ready to spend the night with the girls. Ste, Jaime and Leah are getting ready to return to the gay bar. The last scenes of the film Ste and Jaime dance (on a music of Mama Cass) in an open space of the buildings while the tenants gather to watch something, some in a tumult. Sandra goes out on the balcony next to Leah, looking down on what\'s going on underneath. One of the best scenes I\'ve ever seen in a movie is the extension of Leah\'s hand to Sandra (the symbolism is so powerful). By the way, Sandra and Leah fight like cats and dogs throughout the movie, they improve in the last moments. They both joined Ste and Jaime in the dance, and Sandra finally accepts her son\'s sexuality. It\'s a very powerful film and the title is very appropriate. Glenn and Scott both said in interviews that they received thousands of letters after the movie to ask if they were gay. Glenn disappeared from the screen and Scott did minor things. The language is difficult to understand sometimes. There are websites with slang dictionary used by the working class in Britain. Someone put a scenario for a sequel on the Internet, it\'s pretty good. This is a `` GREAT \'\' movie'",1
"b'They do not do it anymore. This one is really sordid. In fact, sex goes far beyond violence. And the many sex scenes are pretty graphic, close to hardcore. He is also mean, especially in the massage room, where a sadist strikes a woman with her belt. who looks horrible. And his female victims are not too smart, because he approaches them as a ""woman"" very unconvincing and they (including a detective ordinary cloth!) Do not even notice! Like many police films of his time, A SCREAM ... has an open position of self-righteousness. Be wary of the final scene, which also makes good use of the split-screen technique, which was very popular in the early 70\'s. As you\'ve probably guessed, this is politically incorrect and it\'s so amusing! The quality of the image is very impressive. SWV did a good job with the transfer. As usual, the SWV DVD offers many additional features. There is of course the trailer of the film, which includes images not shown in the film. In all, there are a dozen trailers, either American operating revenue or old French crime movies. My favorite among the trailers is THE GODSON with Overchi Stuffy Uschi DIGARD (this movie will be released soon on DVD). A ""play it all"" option for trailers would have been helpful. Five short films, which I liked LE PROWLER, were also included. Since I am a real crime fan, this early 60s black-and-white instructional movie for police officers was very captivating for me. It is also worth noting CRIME IN THE STREET, a crime prevention educational documentary featuring a very young Chuck NORRIS (then karate trainer). The film is entertaining but useless, because all the advice given is so well known and sensible. I did not really like the other three shorts. HARRY NOVAK, CRIME BUSTER is a kind of documentary where a film crew visits Harry NOVAK film producer. After a good time, NOVAK (jokingly) suggests visiting a business partner, who paid with a fake check. NOVAK brandishes a samurai sword and rifle to reinforce his arguments. Strange commercial customs ... Another short film is an extremely stupid sex movie, boring beyond belief and due to a horrible quality almost inviolable. The last short feature is a burlesque strip-tease in black and white. Boring, and by the way: you can not see anything. Even better is the vast Harry NOVAK movie gallery. Buy the DVD but better to skip the last three shorts in the extra features.'",1
"b""It is a film that speaks more of redemption than pure race problems. Kowalski lives in a part of Detroit, where he is retired and a veteran of the Korean War. He is a gruff old man who despises everything and apparently everyone. His community is totally Hmong, with the sole exception of him. We see him with his family and interact with his neighbors and then, as you have seen in caravans, his relationships with local youth. He begins a relationship with Thao and Sue, young Hmong neighbors for whom he builds an affinity. Totally politically incorrect, Kowalski spits racial and ethnic insults in almost every sentence. He's a bit ready, especially since he's become a widower, but he loves his car and his house and wants his world not so much changed. Kowalski calls everyone, and he does not care about the type of riding he gets out of people. It mainly shocks Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, Asians. But you see youth gangs from different ethical perspectives and their own racism. Tho and Sue are like the ones you hear about in the news, kids who have problems meet them, just because they live in those areas. Kowalski gets to know the Hmong and him. He defends his house, his property and his friends. Realism, although surreal, has an impact on our senses when you see the results of the fights. Sometimes this leads to more of the same thing. Kowalski, however, is a figure of redemption, it impacts all who know him, but the greatest impact is on the spectator of Gran Torino. The extras on the DVD are good, more about the car than about the company. Wish there is more about downtown issues and gangs to complete our love affair with big muscle cars.""",1
"b'I bought it thinking that I would receive an episode of one of my favorite movies, Hollywood and the Stars. It\'s not that. (Oh, the perils of online shopping ...) This disc contains three chapters (called ""episodes"") consisting of news clips related to the Second World War, but the similarity with Hollywood and the Stars ends there. Instead of the narration of the inimitable Joseph Cotten, we have received occasional comments from Eric Sevareid. Of course, Mr. Sevareid is a legend among reporters, but he just does not do it if we wait for Joseph Cotten (not to mention the superb theme music of the late Elmer Bernstein). If you have to buy this, do it at your own risk and because its content other than ""Hollywood and the Stars"" interests you, not the list (I got it cheaply from a third party Amazon but all the waste of money is painful for me). For what it\'s worth, I\'ve noticed that it\'s playable in all regions, but I do not know if that will make the conversion from NTSC to PAL. My advice is not to try to discover.'",0
"b'""Lost Highway"" is not as linear, and therefore satisfies our narrative desire, as ""Mulholland Drive"" because it seems indeed too difficult to be strange. But David Lynch is one of the only directors to understand the strangeness of dreamlike cinema. Like Hitchcock, he fully exploits this situation, but in the manner of classical surrealists, and I think this film can be better experienced in a real theater. The terrain of this film is even more deeply unconscious than ""Mulholland Drive"", because its ultimate subject seems to be the act of watching a narrative film itself, such as a truth channel of our society: pictures of scenes of crime. That\'s what makes it interesting. It is so open that it allows each viewer to interpret his or her own interpretation, because the ""surface plot"" mixes with its own interpretive clues. In my opinion, Fred Madison believes he was convicted of murdering his wife on the basis of the images contained in the last videotape with Ren\xc3\xa9e (Patricia Arquette); in the first act, the most important line is his statement that he does not like cameras, because he prefers to remember things in his own way - not necessarily as they did. ""This whole first part of the film is the way Fred remembers his life before being incarcerated, and takes place in a second - after being hit in the face by the police officer who made the arrest. To believe in the mysterious tapes that preceded the murder is his way of trying to convince himself that he did not do it - that the Mystery Man (Robert Blake as wifekiller - ironic, huh?) Did it. The second part, less effective because of its lighter tone, is Madison\'s way of escaping the reality of the electric chair. The light above his cell flickers and probably buzzes because someone is being executed, triggering his fantasy of flight by physically becoming another person. Yet even in this young man\'s life, Renee returns (double ...?) And is free to start a life with her without the memory of her marriage, but learns the sordid truth about her life ... Mystery Man shows up again, this time helping to commit a conscious murder of his former pimp - and allowing him to be filmed to convince himself that this murder (which Fred was able to commit before the movie started) was right. But who the hell knows ... The plot? I have mapped this film after seeing it for the first time, and there are too many doubles that we can not trust as spectators, be it physical reality or mental projection. Each of the interpretations is opposed to the other - like the Moebius tape that Lynch claims the film embodies. It\'s more like a puzzle structured around themes, mostly a subtext involving photography - a picture of twins, porn movies, scary video tapes that appear on their steps like evil calling cards. Make sure to receive a version of this movie in letterbox format. Lynch\'s visual compositions are based on horizontal angles all along, and there are many extreme close-ups in which the tops of the heads are truncated (for some malicious intent, I\'m sure). Cinematography is great, and the soundtrack (not the music, but the atmosphere Lynch is always meticulous) is as important as the images, just like in Eraserhead. ""And after watching a particular scene from this movie, you\'ll be very careful about sharp-edged glass tables for the rest of your life ...""'",1
"b""Yes, my first copy had the audio problem, but the replacement worked well, so do not be afraid to buy this beautiful introduction to a neglected horror star. In a very theatrical way, Tod Slaughter was as nice as Karloff or Lugosi and, as some critics have noted, no actor had as much fun being Bad (with a capital B)! FACE is probably his best and BARN is his first; Both films are perfectly visible with good image quality. So, give the man a chance of horror in Europe; if you like horror movies from the '30s and' 40s, chances are you will not regret it. For my part, I hope to see more Slaughter on DVD.""",1
"b""The video and audio transfer of the old DVD version is excellent. Although the original film was shot with very little light, the Blu-ray versions are much better (although they are not perfect).

This album added only to date has been sold to more than 15 million copies worldwide. In front of them, they sold more records than anyone since the Beatles and no one has sold more than the Spice Girls. They are a landmark in pop music, a legacy and without them, there would be no Britney or Christina.01. Spice Up Your Life (10/10) Yet another No. 1 hit for girls, this song has beautiful lyrics. And it was a smart way to market them. I was impressed by the video, that\'s fine. Super song.02. Stop (10/10) The only song that has not reached the No. 1 in the UK. I like this one. Geri\'s voice is in my opinion the best part of this song. She looks so sweet and perfect in her verses. Catchy lyrics ... a perfect pop song. Too Much (10/10) One of my favorite songs of all time. Just like 2 Become 1. I like the message and the story behind it. When you have it, it is too much ... when it is not the case, it is not enough. GREAT lyrics 04. Saturday Night Divas (10/10) Another of my favorites. I love Melanie C\'s part in the bridge. His voice here amazes me. Emma\'s verses are also perfect. Beautiful song with different original verses. Like ! 05. Never give up good times (10/10) Many fans agree that it would be a super single. This is an excellent song with a great message to everyone. Especially to girls. Be careful and do not get pregnant ... live young while you can. Move Over (8/10) The Pepsi song, but it\'s great overall. A kind of filling on this album, but its regular rhythm and its raw vocals compensate it. Although I prefer the other Pepsi song ""Step To Me"" on this one. It is available on the Japanese version of this album. Do It (9/10) Another song with a good message! My mother did not think about the release of this album, but I agree with everything they say and I always do it. `` The rules are supposed to be broken, do what follows you, not what they want you to do. \'\' 08. Deny (10/10) Reminds me of my ex-boyfriend denying he was really gay. This is one of my favorites. `` You are not fooling anyone but yourself. \'\' If true.09. Viva Forever (10/10) Superb! Beautiful words and melody. Say goodbye to true love ... I can relate to this deeper than many other songs here. This song gives me chills, it\'s a haunting song. One of their best. The Lady Is A Vamp (7/10) Not one of my favorites, but it\'s different. And it\'s a great way to finish the album like a concert ... ""Ladies and gentlemen, we hope you enjoyed the show! `` Overall, this album is as good as the original with as much spice as the previous one. Geri, Emma, \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bMel C, Mel B and Victoria all have equal voices on this one and they all have incredible sound.

Domingo is a strong Calaf with a dramatic voice that hovers over Puccini's masterpiece. His game is huge as usual. Mitchell is the bonus of this big distribution. She sings perfectly and one of the best Liu I've heard. Turandot ... Eva Marton may not be the best Turandot, but it does not matter. When she and Domingo sang in Act III, it was magic. When she shed tears singing my heart pulsated to a renewed passion of why I loved the Opera to begin with. My eyes and ears were glued to my home theater. For all I want, Marton and Domingo could have broken their voices and it would not have mattered to me, because the stars were awarded just above the Met that night. I have not seen the Metha version of Turandot, but it's the best Turandot I've seen so far.""",1

"b'I have a stubborn little girl who resists potty since she was 2 years old too. I felt like she ""knew"" how to do it, but it was deliberately difficult - a kind of power struggle or something.

"b'The five-star review must be done for the Warner Brothers Archive Collection DVD of ""The Prisoner of Zenda"". ""If it was for the release of Grapevine Video, I\'m sure it would have mentioned the abysmal quality of the DVD. The transfer of Grapevine on DVD was made from a very bad copy of the film, without any attempt at restoration. Many title cards are so dark that they are unreadable. It might have been easy to create new title cards for this version - unless the Grapevine people could not read them either. The contrast in a section of the movie is so high that characters and objects are reduced to featureless spots on the screen. I completely agree with the comments of the other reviewer about the game and the cinematographic qualities of the 1922 film. I\'m going to return the Grapvine DVD, and I\'m ready to try the Warner Brothers release, but in the meantime, I will stick to the 1937 version of Ronald Coleman.'",0

However, let\'s be clear about other things as well. First of all, many of the points presented here are true. Which ? Well, I will avoid spoilers but suffice it to say that people often ask me if I am an atheist. No, I say, I do not deny the possibility of a superior being. But I deny the church. This story clearly shows how organized religion systematically destroyed the best messages, but corrupted them with greed, thirst for power, and cruelty. Groups of men made human choices and wrote human words to describe a system that would keep them in power, and this story looks at that. It looks at the little-known facts surrounding the so-called ""Holy Bible"" ... the idea that what we know as the Bible differs greatly from what it once was. Etc. I do not seek to destroy faith, nor does this story. We hope this will encourage the viewer / reader to think about THEIRSELF.

"b'I have never written a review before, but after trying this video, I felt compelled to warn others about the misleading nature of the title of this video. I have a lot of neck and shoulder pain and this video just makes things worse. Anyone with severe muscle tension needs yoga with a lot of stretching for these narrow areas - this video is NOT it! The video begins with pumps and several charging positions that require a lot of the neck and shoulders (like the board and the dog down). This is a fast-paced video - it\'s more like a powerful yoga flow, definitely not something that will ""save your neck and shoulders""! ! ! ! ! It alternates very quickly porting positions and there is almost no stretch in this video! She does not explain poses at all and moves too fast. This video is for advanced power yogies and certainly not for beginners or anyone with any type of pain. I am not a beginner, but I have a lot of neck / shoulder pain and this video is completely inappropriate. There are other reasons also why this video is annoying (but they are much less important): sounds like a kind of voodoo music), background sets are nauseating and it is very false. is excellent!

"b'""Battlefield Earth"" is rightly considered one of the worst movies ever made. He makes ""Manos, Hands of Fate"" a profound, human and poignant drama about the suffering of a cult and ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" sounds like a profound meditation on world peace and the dangers of science. . ""Battlefield"" drew holes bigger than Swiss cheese - and think it was a work of love (!!!) John Travolta saw this film in homage to L. Ron Hubbard. But this resulted in a catastrophic flop. And no wonder. ""Battlefield"" has humans living in primitive conditions, at the mercy of Dreadlocks Psychlos led by John Travolta and Forest Whitaker. Human civilization is in ruins. The special effects sometimes, especially with the ruins, are convincing. Too bad for the rest of the movie. Barry Pepper (who seems to have retired, or something like that) plays the role of the hero, ""Jonny Goodboy.

"b'Every year, when Christmas arrives, I like to have friends to sip a cup of sip (a powerful Nog Egg recipe available on request), put some good Christmas music, light candles, prepare delicious sausages and pick in my humble but sufficient cinema and watching a wonderful holiday favorite. This year, I\'m going to watch Die Hard and for me, Christmas would not be complete without that. John McTiernan (Predator and The Hunt for Red October), a classic action movie that spawned three explosive sequels, never seems to age, no matter how much hair, clothing and portraits of cocaine addicts California fashion can boast. Die Hard follows John McClane (Bruce Willis) at his wife\'s (Bonnie Bedelia) Christmas party in a West Coast skyscraper. He is a New York policeman whose wife and children have moved to the west as he takes a great opportunity and fits. Obviously, they have marriage problems, but they are minimized. The building is empty except for the group that organizes the Christmas party on one of the upper floors. ""Terrorists"" led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) take over the building and chaos ensues. Gruber\'s plan would have worked well if John did not leave and slowly began to release each of his servants, while warning the local authorities. The film makes its appearance and the film explodes into a classic of action ... and also a Christmas classic. He may be as likeable and convincing as John McClane and Bruce Willis surpass all other heroes of the action by making John not only intelligent and funny, but easy to understand with very little drama. It\'s an effortless performance that I can not compare to Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. Intrepid little remarks coupled with a cynical look on his face make John go from good guy to what every boy dreams to become in these circumstances. It \'s fantastic and it\' s kitsch, but it \'s forgivable because it\' s a holiday movie and, more importantly, action is always the priority in Die Hard. On the other hand, Die Hard \'s grandeur is completed by his formidable and accessible antagonist, Hans Gruber. Even after discovering that Hans is not here as a political terrorist, but simply as a thief, he loses absolutely no credibility when he responds to Holly McClane\'s criticism by saying, ""I am an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane and as I\'m moving for the kidnapping, you should be more polite. ""Although we know that Hans is capable of committing ignoble acts, he sees them in reality as mere means of achieving a more or less justifiable end. His disposition is almost humanitarian and you imagine him as a gentleman outside the context of the crimes he commits in the bow of Die Hard. In the end, Hans is a pure sociopath that even the public is brought to sympathize with. I would have liked him to go if his opposition was Van Damme, Segal, or Stallone ... maybe even Arnold. The support cast is another huge force and helps to highlight the humorous innuendo of the film. The cops and feds are all fun and rich characters, especially Reggie VelJohnson, Sergeant LAPD Al Powell. The bad guys are purely chaotic thugs with just enough variety to do a little more than John\'s body count. The performance of William Atherton as a journalist is also noteworthy, as is John\'s limo driver Argyle. Even editions for television versions deserve to be appreciated where the expletive is replaced by wonderfully light little curses such as: * melon farmer * and * bad mother cruncher *. Of course, these make it both fun and accessible to all and Die Hard is one of the best examples of hilariously edited TV movies. But this is of course not what makes it an excellent movie. I would say that Die Hard is the greatest pure action movie ever made. Yippie-ki-yay * muddy funster * ... and happy holidays.'",1
"b'Put my two cents: The girl who went through the time was on my watch list for a while, but I never took the time to check until yesterday. I (like most other critics) did not expect much, but after watching their new movie `` Summer Wars``, I decided to give it a try. I must say that although it is a little older, it far exceeds the summer wars (except perhaps the computer animation). This movie literally has no weakness. The quality of the animation remains high everywhere. The characters are beautifully drawn by hand and the backgrounds carefully rendered (mainly hand-drawn). The use of computer animation is minimized and occurs primarily when we see a ""jump"". The characters are strong and friendly. Makoto is your typical clumsy teenager. A chance meeting followed by a (almost) horrible accident allows him to cross the time. Rather than using this ability for what is called ""evil"" (I would skip and invest heavily in some titles ...), Makoto uses the ability to make his life and that of his friends better. However, it begins to cause unforeseen and disastrous circumstances. And that\'s about the moment the film goes from light and rather comical to completely dramatic and sad. I will not divulge any event or spoil any plot for you, but let\'s say that I was moved at the end of the movie (but not really with tears in my eyes!). 2/3 of the main characters are expressed by a first vocal actor. This will show you how in Japan they take the voice seriously and do well (rather than the majority of American dubbing companies that have a core of 5 or 6 full-time actors that they MUST match a main character of each series) or movie - often not the best match for the character). So the story is strong with a little sci-fi, the characters are nice and well portrayed, the voice play is beautiful, the animation is beautiful ... why did not you see him yet? If you\'re not a fan of anime, this could be a good movie to help you change your mind.'",1
"b""It's unfathomable that anyone would think it's a good idea - take a beloved classic movie and: 1. Cut 15 minutes of footage.2. Add 15 minutes of new badly shot sequences with extremely difficult play, writing and direction. Empty the original score and replace it with a painfully amateurish electronic drivel4. Add insult to injury by marketing it in a misleading way like the final edition of the 30th anniversary. Words can not express how terrible this edition is. Really, it's THAT. I've seen student movies and better-made amateur fan issues. The new footage is so badly written and played that it would be almost funny if it was not part of this classic movie.

Unfortunately, the management and editing is deplorable, especially in the fight scenes of the Civi War, and after the long rise of Demon Mountain, there is a real anti-climax feeling. The trip is not helped by this DVD version of Synergy, which is technically laughable, a dubious video recording transferred to digital media with the usual high level of degradation of sound and image. Worse, these are the holes where the ""bad"" language has been excised and, more importantly, the blood and blood have been removed surgically, which may explain why this version lasts 90 minutes while the original print was 114.'",0

There was no speech in felt for the victims of AIDS, no anxiety about the pain of going out, just great characters engaged in a funny offbeat script (with a dialouge like that of Neal Simon) who works. There are many complicated elements that combine well and it's not easy to do. The way the writer binds the main characters struggles to finish his song with the rest of the plot. I also differ with critics of a previous author who claimed that the two characters had no chemistry and would never be together in & quot; reality & quot; . One could see J.P. Pitoks' admirable performance that the character was more than a beef cake. In fact, I thought they were making a really cute realistic couple, not in spite of their differences. The final scene walking down the street said it all ... Gabriel could not shut up and Mark could not speak. But laughed in the right places.

Also, let Karen Voight produce a video filled with interesting combinations compiled so that the training comes at full speed. Karen Voight is the best in her field for a reason. His incredible signal, his instructions and the exercises themselves work surprisingly well. This video is no exception. By working the body, Karen focuses on specific areas, but keeps the whole body moving throughout the video. Although the background is a bit dated, as well as floral leotards, the workout is not. My only complaint is that she is talking about music in the background ... the music would be good if it was more than confused background noise. But the training is so complete and new that this flaw can be neglected. Really another killer by Karen Voight!""",1

My experience has been that high-definition DVDs are the same as the Blu-ray version (either on a Blu-Ray player or an up-convert DVD player). Ultraviolet is no exception. In addition, the appearance of the film seems to soften the details, which goes against the goal of Blu-ray. Apart from any improvement in the look, the Blu-ray version has no more features than the DVD, and the extended DVD has an extra seven minutes. Go with the DVD version on this one.'",0

This episode was really a special show 3 weeks before the start of season 4. It's a shame, it should have been included in this box set for a complete set. They could have made a separate menu.

"b""The classic tale of demonic possession, based on William Peter Blatty's bestselling novel. Linda Blair is Regan MacNeil, a twelve-year-old girl with a truly malevolent spirit. His mother, Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), agnostic, seeks the help of a young Jesuit psychiatrist, Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller, may God leave his Irish soul!) Who has his own demons and who is tormented by the recent death of his mother and his loss in the faith in which he sought refuge. After confronting the demon within the girl (and himself), Karras, though skeptical of demonic possession, is allowed by the church to help during the exorcism. The priest chosen to perform the ritual is a mysterious and old Jesuit Father Lankaster Merrin (Max Von Sydow) who has already seen such a diabolical work. While the two clergymen face the devil, a police detective, Lieutenant William F. Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb), finds links between death and desecration in the local Catholic church. William Friedkin brilliantly directed Blatty adapted the script (receiving an Oscar for his efforts) and produced. The distribution gives extraordinary and delicate performances (Burstyn, Miller and Blair have all been nominated for the Oscars) and the special effects are breathtaking and continue to fury, with veteran actress Mercedes McCambridge providing the voice of the entity Maleficent. (The film also won the award for Best Achievement in Sound). The theme behind much of Blatty 's work is obvious, his philosophy being, if there' s all that evil there, why is there so much good? Metaphorically, everyone fights his own demons, and even in his last moment of selflessness, Karras regains his faith and gives his life heroically to save this innocent child. How can this be more meaningful? A truly terrifying, captivating and ultimately touching film about faith and human fragility.""",1

"b""This story caught my attention immediately and held it for the entire movie. The film is based on the life of John Nash. He was a brilliant mathematician who became famous as a young man for his work in economics. The film spans decades and begins when John Nash arrives at Princeton University. Russell Crowe does an excellent job as Nash. The game required the transformation of Nash, a healthy young man, into an aging schizophrenic. Alicia, Nash's wife is played by Jennifer Connelly. She is very convincing as a smart and strong woman who realizes that her bright husband is very disturbed and lives in another world. A special and charming scene comes to mind where Nash and his future wife look at the stars. He tells her to think of different shapes or different animals and is able to look at the night sky, with its millions of stars, and connect them in some form. I wish there were more scenes of this kind and perhaps a little glimpse of Nash's family and childhood. John Nash was finally awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for mathematics, which is a consolation, but the illusions were something I will not forget. I came out of this film with a lot of compassion for John Nash. Schizophrenia is really a horrible mental illness. This film deserves to be seen and I believe it will stand the test of time.""",1

"b'I felt compelled to write a review of this film for several reasons. First of all because it\'s one of my favorite movies. I never tire of watching this movie again and again and sharing with others who have not had the pleasure of watching it yet. I also wanted to write this review because many young moviegoers immediately reject older films and especially black and white films. And finally, I wanted to put my two cents after reading the criticism of the professional critic. ? ? How could there be a casting film more perfectly, better? ? ? Gregory Peck, whom I had just venerated as Atticus Finch in ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" (which is why I wanted to become a lawyer when I was a child), and Audrey Hepburn has the perfect blend of innocence and fearlessness for her role as rebel princess. Even Eddie Albert as the comic side was ideal. This film follows a princess who, at first sight, lives an enviable life of wealth, glory and glory. I\'ve always struggled to find compassion for the complaints of like-minded people, either in real life or in the movies, but Audrey Hepburn manages to comfort her by discovering things as simple as her hair needs to be cut and to eat an ice cream. Although Gregory Peck is undeniably smooth as a rogue American journalist, he is also able to carry out his task to make his role credible. You must be able to understand that his initial motivation does not come from a ""good place"", but simply from greed and selfishness. but we must also believe in his change of heart and his subtlety. And it works. He does not wake up abruptly and changes his mind. You can see its transformation, or its relevance, throughout the film. As a romantic closet, I must say that I still hope there will be a better ending (and by ""better"" than I do not speak about movie quality, I mean by a ""happy ending"" classic). The final scene is heartbreaking, but the only possible way plausible for her to end. I always wonder what happened later, although I know the answer very well ... and that\'s not necessarily what we would all like to imagine. But I respect the fact that the film does not spell it and does not pack it in a pretty bow. Another tear, but exactly as it should. Please see this movie. You will want to own it after, I promise. And do not be fooled, it\'s not just an old film of chicks ""outdated"". ""It\'s just good. Oh yes, and that * sigh factor * ... huge! Enjoy and share with a younger audience so that this classic is never lost for modern blockbusters.'",1

"b'I agree with critics who say that the production of this concert sequence is very poor. If you want to watch Evanescence in concert, chances are you will not find it here. It\'s more like a video clip than a concert. It has been changed to the nth degree and rarely focuses on a single shot for more than two seconds. Fortunately, the DVD has redeeming factors, including the painfully emotional music videos for ""Bring Me to Life,"" ""Going Under,"" ""My Immortal,"" and ""Everybody\'s Fool."" The elements behind the scenes are slightly amusing, if not more. It is good to show that this group has a lot of fun on the road, giving the impression that they will not leave the world anytime soon. Although the video aspect of the DVD is poorly done, the audio is much better, so if possible, I recommend buying the concert CD instead of the DVD. In any case, Amy\'s voice is well known in concert, which I was not sure; you know how some singers have a sound completely different from that of a recording? Well, she does not do it. Her voice falters during some fast-paced songs, but you can expect it when she runs and jumps on stage. I was particularly impressed by the ballads; Her powerful vocals combined with her beautiful piano playing were scary, especially during Breathe No More and the My Immortal band hit. I surprised myself by discovering that I really liked ""Thoughtless"", the recovery of the group KoRn. I\'ve never been a KoRn person, nor an alternative-rock-heavy-metal-of-all-genre, but I was impressed by how Evanescence interpreted this song. Faded away \'\' . Just like the other ballads of the group, this song is soft, sweet and endowed with good voices and beautiful words. In conclusion, Evanescence sounds very, very well on this CD. It\'s a real pleasure to listen; it\'s just the DVD that, well, it sucks a little.'",1

Did not Mr. Spielberg know if he would make enough money at the box office to advertise Aquafina, Pepsi, Gap, Lexus and Nokia throughout the movie? Overall, I spent two and a half hours in the movie, wondering more than once if everyone walking around the room during the movie was as bored as I was?

Indeed, he never manages to raise the tension, even in the scenes that by the rights should be the most interesting in the film, as the revelation of what happened between Furlong and his girlfriend. All performances are intact and correct; this is exactly the kind of role that Streep best fits (although it was much nicer in ""The Wild River""), Neeson is also fine in a sadly stereotyped role and even though Furlong is often labeled as the teenager in difficulty it plays better than any other.However, the main defect is that something that promises emotion does not really reach boiling point and despite the names of the stars you can not help but think that it all looks a lot like a movie of television.

And most importantly, an 80s hard rock soundtrack. This is one of my favorite party movies because it makes everyone scream (even non-horror fans). It's sometimes bloody, but the comedy hides the elements of horror. The DVD in question is a little light on the extras, except for a fun documentary, but lukewarm. But the big advantage is the best picture and sound quality I have ever seen this movie. The DVD really makes the difference. Get a copy and see what I mean, you will not regret it.""",1

"b""As this movie is out of print, it took me a few weeks to find a copy. However, once I did, I felt like I found the Holy Grail horror movie. The story revolves around a scandalous affair led by a bored housewife (Julia Cotton) and her brother-in-law (Frank Cotton). Julia and her husband move into Frank's old house after Frank's sudden death. Of course, Frank did not really disappear. Instead, the evil brother-in-law found a cube-shaped puzzle. Once opened, the puzzle opens a portal on the world of the Cenobites. Cenobites offer the ultimate pleasure, but at a high cost. Able to escape the world of the Cenobites once a drop of his brother's blood has spread to the floor of the house, Frank returns like a corpse, needing parts of the body of living beings to complement each other. new. Frank uses his past relationship with Julia to convince her to bring him new victims. With each victim, Frank becomes more complete, but also more impatient. There are several scenes of prefiguration, praying mantis and nasty spider with Julia as she goes to the bars and picks up random men for the massacre. Of course, finally, her actions bring out the suspicions of her adult stepdaughter and her husband ... The film presents the introduction of the Cenobites, who are among the most frightening cats since the Xenomorphs of Alien. As the film progresses, we learn more about these beings, their origin and their purpose. Of course, the end leaves everything in suspense, which leads to several sequels. I highly recommend this film to those who like to watch the first horror movies made by those who are now considered masters of the genre.""",1
"b'For the big fans of Manhunter, I advise you not to use this DVD if you plan to own ... What was billed as ""& quot;"" Theater & quot; the version is actually a poorly edited version that clumsily edits two scenes that were in the theatrical release, including one of the most essential scenes, and yet contains some of the most mundane images restored from the floor of the hall cutting. These cuts are poorly made and do not make any sense to them, considering how they do not represent the release in theaters and destroy the momentum of what had been a finely edited film. I do not know if it was ignorance or arrogance, but it\'s the worst hacking job I\'ve ever seen trying to pretend to be a product. Whoever was responsible for that in Anchor Bay was an idiot and if I were Michael Mann, I would call my lawyers. The & quot; Director\'s Cup & quot; is even worse in that it includes the & quot; Non-theatrical & quot; release AND the so-called & quot; Director\'s Cup & quot; - a compilation of some interesting and uninteresting catches. In addition to a real theatrical release, it would have been a fascinating addition. But here again, Anchor Bay finds a way to ruin what should be a good product. The entire movie that has not been submitted to video post-production is stained and blurred, as if it had been transferred from a VHS cassette - and worn out. - just amazing that anyone can have the audacity to offer this kind of low price for hard earned money. I saw this movie when it first appeared in the theater and considered it one of the best of this year; and I rushed to buy the LaserDisc version when it came out. When Anchor Bay released the director\'s DVD this year, I was on the waiting list, ready to welcome the big-screen THX version. Being intimately aware of the film, imagine my disappointment. Do not waste your time. Wait for a better version to go out. As for those who want to compare Silence of the Lambs to Manhunter, they generally prefer each other and their ideas are pretty well established at this point. I\'m right in Manhunter\'s camp. For me, I enjoyed Silence, but I could never take it seriously, because I found Lector\'s portayal both superhuman and surreal and therefore unrealistic. However, Lector by Manhunter is a terrifying but more realistic portrait that intrigues me every time I see it in the way that an evil genius manages to manipulate events outside his cell by simply using a phone. This Lector is safe behind the steralized bars - and yet still manages to be a powerful presence with which to count. and edgey, and yet that flowed gracefully. Siskel and Ebert ranked it among the best films, years after its release. But for now, I\'m going to keep my LaserDisc.'",0
"b'I saw and liked these three movies, so I did not scroll down to read the reviews. I should have . The first movie was great, the second movie was awesome, the third movie was D3, the record was titled D3, but the movie was ... ..Monkeys Go Home. I sent him back for a replacement and the 3rd movie was again ""Monkeys Go Home"". So, the monkeys are returning.'",0
"b'All 3 movies are nice, sitting on the edge of your seat, but most people already know the stories. The first of 3 films, The Bourne Identity presents both excellent video and very discreet channel tracking in audio. The sound mixers have done a great job using all the surround channels and do not allow the soundtrack to mask the different foley effects in the front or rear channels. Of course, in all this excitement, your subwoofer will have a good workout. The video transfer is pretty good without video noise, aliasing or artifacts. This movie started all the franchise and it was a great start. My only question was how Bourne was shot in the back in the first place. This question has never really been answered because amnesia is usually caused by severe head trauma and not by two bullets in the back. The second film in the trilogy, Bourne Supremacy, was much more appealing to me, I remember a friend, and a professional photographer, mentioning that it made him seasick. Blu ray video was excellent in all respects, but I also noticed a much less significant use of directional audio. Rather than putting money into more discreet sound montages, the producers reinforced the soundtrack that enveloped almost the entire sound stage, front and back. It\'s not that the soundtrack does not match the movie, it certainly does, and creates an exciting atmosphere for the Bourne movie, but more attention to the 5.1 soundscape for the crazy effects would have been nice. , the Bourne Ultimatum, completes the package with the same strength in video transfer. I did not notice any weakness in the video transfers for the 3 films, but again, in the Bourne Ultimatum, you would think that with all the excitement, the use of the front and back faces would be more important. I was disappointed that, just like the Bourne Supremacy, they simply increased the audio levels of the soundtrack, which would obscure any foley effect. I\'m not saying that there is no use of discreets in the last two movies, but not as much as what could have been or how it was used in the first Bourne Identity. To save $, they only increase the level of the soundtrack and it\'s a shame. During the fight scene, things are thrown, broken glass and all sorts of troubles that could easily have been directed to the left or right, front or back. So, on this score, I was disappointed.However, it is an excellent collection to have and the enthusiasm and pace of the 3 films are just excellent. There are a lot of deleted scenes and other short films as well as comments without loss of space for previews and announcements for other movies. It\'s really worth it. Fortunately, this review has been helpful and, if so, please check the ""Useful"" button, so I know I\'m on the right track with my comments for you. Thank you .'",1
"b'From time to time there is a film that has hardly ever been advertised or even a decent release for the general public, alas the purgatory of limited series and art films. However, in the case of Equilibrium, I am more surprised to see why this version has never been released more widely. Seeing the movie, honestly, I had no other expectation than to see artillery games and martial arts as the star of the film. While this factor has been entertaining, the real star belongs to the finely crafted storyline that pays homage to novels such as ""Brave New World,"" ""1984,"" and ""Fahrenheit 451."" History places the viewer in the post-apocalyptic world of the future. Having suffered the after-effects of the Third World War, the survivors were forbidden to form a new society that would rid them of the greatest faults of humanities, emotions. Controlled by a drug, which cancels such senses, the future is a utopia without war, but enslaved to those who hold the power and establishment created. Art, music, literature, all this is forbidden and the penalty for committing such crimes is death. The most feared protector of the establishment is the Cleric. A group of men trained in the mind and body to be the perfect killing machines and children posters of their ideals. One of these clerics, who even executed his own partner for reading a book of poems, begins to see the world in a new light when he misses his usual dose and feels a flood of emotions that he had never felt before. While trying to maintain his duty, he finds the cruel sadism of his appointed task almost more than he can bear it. In a desperate search, he tries to find resistance and put an end to the madness he has preserved. Christian Bale, playing the Cleric, gives incredible depth and emotion to a role that did not require any. In this, he makes the film even deeper. The cinematic style and editing, borrowed from filmmakers such as John Woo and Tsui Hark, bring enough freshness while adapting these styles. The art direction is creating a claustrophobic world of sinister lies. Although the scenery of the city is not so impressive and are obviously effects of CG. The music is sometimes dark and mingled with the pressing conflict that follows, and then it\'s a fast-paced techno score that sets the pace for the shooting without fail. In all, Equilibrium is a science fiction fan dream come true, but it\'s also a movie that can also be enjoyed by fans of classical literature. Although the end may seem too simplified, I found it actually deeper and more interesting about humanity in general. But most will be delighted at the end of the ten-minute shootout, with an impressive duel at the sword. The balance contains strong language and violence and is recommended for ages 17 and over. For once, style and substance clash with celluloid.'",1
"b'I can not say more about this DVD! ! ! ! I think they did their best by integrating music with phonetics. I swear that my 6-year-old son in grade 1 improved his reading and spelling a lot after watching this video. At the beginning of the school year, her spelling averaged 3 out of 8 and on her first newsletter, the teacher said she needed more help reading. I shot this video a few times a week for a few weeks for her to look at it and every time I launched it in another chapter. His reading and spelling have improved considerably. Now she got an 8/8 on her spelling. Every day at school, she started coming home with stickers that she said she did a good job of reading. She said that this phonics video taught her to read! ! ! Just a few weeks ago we were going through the series of Dora phonemes and now she is reading me books she got from the library and are at a higher level. Great video! ! ! ! I think all Kindergarten and Grade 1 teachers should use this video to supplement their teaching. Students have a lot more to do with a teacher trying to teach it.'",1
"b""I thought it was a really effective learning product. You are able to go back if you miss something and the more you play, the better you get. They teach a wide variety of words as a sign and I found that excellent. Do not buy the other DVD `` Say it with Sign ''. It's not as well assembled and it's very repetitive. I found it confusing and useless. This one is great.""",1
"b'I really enjoyed this movie and would give it 20 stars if I could. I highly recommend it. The musical numbers are great and the story too. Jane Powell and Fred Astaire dance beautifully together. They do not do it anymore. The colors, the sets and the costumes are also great!'",1
"b'Clint Walker, the incredibly handsome and honest cowpoke, who tries to avoid problems, but who will fight for common decency, honesty and values, is the quintessence of the Western hero. Great episodes of an EVERYMAN we need for this day and age. Themes of Good vs. Evil, through each episode. It is a simple formula, but recalls simpler times in 1950s America. This DVD of three shows brings back adult westerns. Not just shoot-em-ups, but with drama as a major element. (There is a lot of action to be sure.) THE BEST of GENDER! Looking for all seasons to come out!'",1
"b""It was fun to read these articles by people who were so moved and amused by this film. I saw it when it first appeared and I always had Cat Stevens songs in my head. It's one of those movies that personally affects fans, and my favorite moment after all these years is (as is the case with some of these writers) Maude throwing Harold's charm into the river, because she now has' ll & quot; always know where it is. & quot; It was my first glimpse of the depth of the film, and I never lost it. If you have not seen the movie yet, you can probably read some of these articles and not lose them for you. There is so much to laugh about and admire, and of course, these songs. . . .""",1
"b""It is about one of the films most loved by the affections of the foreign cinematographic scene. Tati has provided a brilliant link between the best of what the era of silent film and modern film had to offer. This is a relatively simple story about a clumsy man on vacation on the French coast. But repeated screenings, especially over the years, open more and more treasures that were not yet recognized, like a classic novel. I would be surprised if someone comes to this movie the first time he looks at it. I certainly do not have. But the repetition of visits over the years will give you an appreciation of this film that borders on the cult. Every member of my extended family loves this movie, and everyone has their own reason. Some like it for its ability to perfectly capture a foreign time and place, making it feel as if they had escaped to the French coast for the afternoon. Some like Hulot's clumsy but endearing romance attempts. Many like funky funky gags, no matter how many times you've seen them. But no matter what a viewer likes most, everyone will feel a connection to the character of Hulot (and, in turn, Mr. Tati) who will last a lifetime. With this DVD, I can finally feel safe to lend my beloved granular VHS copy. A classic film by every sense of the word.""",1
"b""When I was ten, my mother's uncle gave me his copy of Cornelius Ryan's A Bridge Too Far. It was a very special gift from him, since he was deported to Germany to work for the Reich during the Second World War and never recovered mentally from what had happened to him. At the time I got the book, he was living in a small village, a few miles west of Arnhem, on the south bank of the Rijn River. Over the years, my interest in World War II and Operation Market Garden began to grow, and every time A Bridge Too Far was broadcast, I watched it. The scenes depicting the drops of paratroopers and the assault on the Waal River were the ones we remembered most. That, and the great score of John Addison. I finally bought the DVD and have watched it a few times since. I must say that every time I watch it, the film improves. Especially with the subtitles: first those that specify where we are. Without these, one might wonder where the viewer has been brought from one scene to another. Secondly, because English is not my first language, I was able to understand some of the dialogues better. (Finally, I understood what Liv was trying to say in Dutch =) The widescreen option is fantastic. You really get into the battle scenes and to see all the extra footage ... For example, when John Frost's battalion enters Arnhem, you see people riding a bicycle in the background, which you can not see in the pan and scan version.But with such support as DVD, and also with the 25th anniversary movies last year, MGM and United Artists missed a great chance. It's a shame that the only extra is the original trailer. I really would have liked to see additional images included on a second disc. The Dutch Broadcasting Company (NOS) must have a lot of file sequences, I remember that the information broadcast often spent time on the shooting of the film, like reconstituted excrement. In addition to these images, the studio must also have additional images. They could even produce a new documentary on the filming of this film, including interviews with lead actors and Sir Richard Attenborough. And what about images and original notes about the battle? Despite this, it's still a must buy if you're in war and / or classic movies. After 25 years, this is always the case and it is always a pleasure to watch. Buy it and in the meantime, keep hoping for a special DVD edition. I give 4 stars to this DVD, but if they had included additional material, it would easily get 5 stars!""",1
"b'This film has always been one of my favorites. I have three copies on VHS (two backups replace the one I usually watch). I ask all my friends to watch it, and most like it as much as me. It\'s stupid, completely inept and totally hilarious. I put it with Richard Elfman \'s ""Forbidden Zone"" and John Paiz\' s ""Crimewave"" (aka ""The Big Crimewave"") as one of the three greatest cult movies of all time. The problem is that no one has ever heard of this movie. I could not believe my luck when I came across the DVD! ! ! I thought I was dreaming. I was tempted to buy three copies ... just in case. First, I watched the scenes and extras removed, which was pretty good. It seemed strange, because I had already seen a lot of deleted scenes (they are part of my VHS versions). Then, when I sat down to watch the movie, my heart was broken. Someone, in his infinite wisdom, has decided to censor almost all nakedness, and many others have been shortened or are completely absent. I guess this version of the movie may seem a bit morose, because the missing scenes may have slowed down the film a little bit, but the scenes that were happening were all irrelevant. The ineptitude of this film is what made it special, and editing it to a more ""professional"" version is a limit blasphemy. After seeing this edited and censored version, I wish I had never bought it at all. I wish that did not even exist. Thank you my god for my copies of the VHS. Anyone who has decided to censor and edit this film should be disconcerted. Thank you very much for destroying one of my favorite movies. I only give him two stars because the extras are cool.'",0

"b'I only write this review so that this film does not contain the three stars of the only criticism. There are a handful of Vietnam War movies, and each covers its own terrain. Full Metal Jacket is somehow the exception in that it covers the ground as the other three all do separately. Platoon covers the real fight, the feeling of hell it has produced in an individual fighting, the jungle, the trauma The Deer Hunter covers the trauma of the post-war, the long-term effect on the psyche of a veteran.Apocalypse today covers the psychological (and poetic) heart of war, that is to say the heart of It is hatred, fear and the pitiless nature of the universe. After all, it\'s based on ""Heart of Darkness"". ""Overall, it could be the most terrifying and convincing. In turn, Heart of Darkness and this film are based on a long literary background called ""katabasis"" in Greek, that is, the descent into the underworld. It\'s epic, punctuated by a scene after scene that becomes dark and twisted, and the protagonist is forced to go to hell without knowing why - because the evil exists, he feels attracted, trying to understand it, or he he can not be part of it. Transiently, he asks you to try to understand the evil. If I had not already done so, I would certainly buy it instantly for $ 6, as do all who see this page and have not seen the movie.'",1
"b""I never had the chance to see this movie when it arrived in theaters. I rented it without knowing what to expect. After watching it on DVD, I can say that I would not have to pay the price of the movie ticket to see this movie. It's not all that is more glamorous, but what it is, it's a good film well-being and respectable. Gabrielle Union does a good job playing a rude, hateful and hateful sister, Eva. Sometimes she gets the upper hand, but that's how she is paid. Eva is ready to take care of her little sister who gives him advice instead of his men. The sister loves Eva and listens as if her word was the gospel. Men hate her bowels and want nothing more than to see her leave the city. She often interferes with the relationships of her sisters and makes a point of making the men of her sisters crazy. Thus, in order to bring order to their respected relationships, men plot to get Eva out of their lives. So, the need of Ray (LL Cool J). Ray is a smooth playa with serious play. The men are telling Ray to go out with Eva to get her out of their lives. Ray agrees and the story begins with two people falling in love with each other and not supposed to fall in love. It's when things get complicated for Ray and Eva. Some parts of the film were a little outrageous and the end was not the best, but overall it was a very good movie. I read some of the reviews on this movie and other movies too. My thing is that if you want real situations, go watch a drama or a real story. It's comedy ... the comedy is not supposed to be real. It's really an escape from reality. Do not we all need that now? Anyway, in addition to the end, this movie was done well with the actors who are doing a great job to play their respected roles. In addition, the women of this film are doing well. In addition, LL did a good job playing Ray. I have a lot of respect for him as an actor. He did not play his role too much, but he made it credible. Overall, I give this movie a B +. The end was a little cliche.""",1

"b'As many have said, this version of the film is inferior to its previous incarnations. I watched this movie on TV and VHS since my childhood. I have loved it since then and never got tired of it. I was so disappointed by the release of the Warner DVD. Half of the music is discreet. And worse, half of the sound effects are missing. The sound of swords. The cry of the eagles. The sound of Sting slicing spiders. The sound of Glamdring cutting Goblins. Much more . All parties. They even cut off bits of dialogue. At one point, Bilbo just seems to be talking to himself because the off-camera dialogue is gone. The film was made dead and lacks emotion. I hope they correct that with a future version.

They were the best parts of the movie.'",0
"b'This inept film does not have much to do. A sort of JURASSIC PARK with the billionaire playing with genetics and inventing three nasty sabretooth tigers. The script calls them huge but they do not seem very big and CGI effects are well below par. The cast is also inefficient, Robert Carradine making an impression of Jack Nicholson, Nicholas Bell being British and boring and Stacy Haiduk trying to express her sexuality but not doing it. The sub-plot involves, what else, a group of unscrupulous students who choose this resort as a treasure hunt for new pledges. There is no suspense but there is a strange ending for Mr. Bell, who is quite innovative. No real bite in this one, though.'",0
"b""It is a little-known but absolutely wonderful film that, small as it may seem, deserves to be shared by many. A short film about a family and the small trials and tribulations they experience every day. what makes this film so amazing is how it is able to present this window in the life of this group of people with so much wit and insight, sadness and honesty; ultimately resulting in a film that is tender and uplifting and full of hope. His game is just great. All the words from Brenda Blethyn to Timothy Spall to Marianna Jean Baptiste, to Claire Rushbrook, all take turns taking scenes in such natural performances and at times that it does not even make them feel like acting. acting game that goes straight to the heart. The script is wonderful because it provides so many small details that we do not think to include in a movie. Just the smallest things that, one way or another, bring the characters to life. A wonderful film that will never be acclaimed because it's actors. No special effects or half sex scenes.

"b'As other commentators have said, I was anxious to watch an authentic adaptation of H.G. Wells\' classic novel. At the same time, I knew that this film was made with a modest budget, with the expected results. This movie was worse than expected. The special effects seemed rather caricatural, especially compared to the state of the art (Spielberg). Worse still, the use of color filters in many scenes had to be extremely annoying after a while. Even the overall quality of the print was mediocre at best, with oversaturated color and sharpness. And the comedian will not have Oscar nominations. I also wonder if the original 3-hour version would be better for watching stories. In this 125-minute version, there is a lot of leap from one sub-plot to another without proper scene development in my opinion. The Martian ""red weed"" appears briefly in a few scenes without any explanation. On the positive side, I thought the tripods and handling machines looked pretty cool, the sound effects are pretty good and the musical score is beautiful. Unfortunately, this is not enough to overcome the otherwise poorly executed production. If only the CGI was at the forefront of technology and the color filters were eliminated, it would be a good movie, but not great. If only ... ..'",0

Each time, I am fascinated by the fact that Bill Murray, totally egocentric, is caught in this wonderful paradox of time, reliving the same day. It goes through different stages: fear and confusion; euphoria, when he realizes he can do anything without consequence; despair, when he realizes that life does not make sense if one pursues egoistic pleasures without goals; and finally a peaceful self-realization when he devotes himself to the self-improvement and humanitarian goals that his situation gives him the opportunity to pursue. He pauses to think about what each of the United States would do under similar circumstances. Oh, it's really funny, too.""",1

She keeps looking pretty and tries to look tough pushing buttons and giving updates to Stephen Dorff when he can see for himself what's going on.

Lohan has that grumpy and grumpy voice that annoys you, just like his close cousin, Miley Cyrus, and it hurts you very quickly, like a squeaky door handle. You have no idea what\'s going on at first, and then it\'s even worse than the most horrible offer Lifetime has given us over the years. ring true. Too bad it does not lead directly to a cliff. Add to that the fact that Julia Ormond ""plays"" with a mother who has just let her daughter ride with a boyfriend and make her brain flinch. Oh yes ? I do not care who you think you are; amnesia - or whatever - would not be enough for me to let my kids do carnal pleasures under my roof. You do not like any of these characters and you do not feel sorry for them. This is the key to a good movie in any genre - feel compassion, or at least empathy - for at least two people in one feature. There is none of this, and we are entitled to tons of bloody scenes that do not even manifest themselves with the desired effect. When you get there, the best actors of IKWKM are the blue rose petals. In short, two hours have been dismembered from my life that I will never come back.'",0
"b'This film is in English with its main American star. However, it is a Japanese collaborative effort. Essentially a Japanese horror film, he has similarities with The Grudge. ""Again, we have an obsession that delivers chills by having the face veiled by the hanging hair. I do not know why hiding an apparition behind strands of hair is so strange - but it is. In addition, driving on a lonely road at night is strange in itself. And when you have a corpse in the trunk of your car - the journey becomes doubly dangerous. The acting game is usually made of wood. The actress who plays one of the main centers of interest is Japanese with a very limited command of the English language. With so many actors eagerly available to appear in the movies, I do not know why they can not find a better talent. So this movie is not very memorable. But it\'s not a complete waste of time. It will make you think twice the next time you load a corpse into your car and go to the nearest lake to get rid of it. You will realize that you may only have a few night terrors.'",0

"b'I agree with the first guy. This movie pack was not great. I bought it in the hope of seeing real combat footage (or any other video) taken during the Vietnam War. instead, every VHS that is supposed to specifically target a US combat aspect to Vietnam (ie, marines, bombers, navy, helicopters, etc.) only shows the same images over and over again . For example, each video shows a diving helicopter firing rockets and B-52s dropping bombs, which is cool the first time you see it, but after 10,000 times you lost your money.'",0

(He's 8 months old now) He particularly loves Baby Mozart, not just because he likes to listen to music (he's a real fan of Mozart since he's in my belly), another visual stimulation of DVD. Compared to Baby Beethovan, Baby Mozart keeps his attention constantly. There are some parts of the Beethovan DVD that have pictures of animals and my son did not like that. He prefers to see the animals move than to see a picture of them. Hey, what are the books for, right? He also likes the language Baby Eistein for the same reasons. Very colorful and keeps his attention.""",1
"b'I try to get in shape. I can walk Leslie Sansone 2-mile no problem, but after about 20 minutes of this DVD, my heart rate was too high and I was actually starting to whistle. It\'s a good exercise and something to build, but very discouraging for a real beginner. In addition, everyone on the DVD is VERY fit - not much encouragement here for someone who has just started. In addition, ""jump"" is included, which is just a recipe for a beginner\'s injury. I think beginners should avoid this workout.'",0
"b""I can not believe that this movie was released in such a bad state. it's fully screen only. The sound looks like a cassette. The picture is dark and fuzzy.

"b'I imagine this odd little exercise of Bill Zebub, a low-budget schlockmeister, owes a lot to his inspiration for the South Park team\'s ""Team America"" \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bpuppet epic. After a long comic ""warning"" at the beginning of the film, ""the plot"" essentially tries to parody many Hollywood movies, politics and religions, and inject as many disturbing images as possible of sexually mutilated Barbi dolls. ""Actiing"" is provided by a variety of ""action"" toys that are handled (disordered) by hand and via green screen overlays. A bit of that is fun, but ultimately, the concept is out of breath and Zebub\'s macabre foreboding with vilely S & M images perpetuated on female dolls becomes quite frightening. However, the basic concept has some ingenuity that makes this satirical film more appealing than most ostensibly more serious Zebub efforts. I would recommend not to buy it (or not at all) at a minimal (used) price, because the content would probably not result from multiple views.'",0

"b'Ah, Gargoyles, finally, have a well deserved DVD release. This series is really excellent and has the honor of being one of Disney \'s most mature animated series to date. The series revolves around a group of living gargoyles, which are stone in day and night. Due to a curse inflicted upon them, a small group of these creatures are stuck in stone for a thousand years before being woken up in Manhattan in 1994. Like all the supernatural beings of Manhattan, they naturally decide to fight The crime. It may sound corny, but in the hands of a formidable team of writers, the series becomes much more than a story of ""fighting the crime of non-human superheroes"". Instead, Gargoyles becomes an interesting story with an attractive storyline and good characters. This series is helped by its ability to take risks - the first episode ends even with what is essentially a mass murder. The show also addresses issues such as gun control in a fairly mature and realistic way, while managing not to be too moral or preachy. For example, the gun control episode ""Deadly Force"" (disgracefully omitted by Toon Disney because of the presence of firearms and firearms, despite its strong message against the inexperienced game with such weapons and the release of the DVD) sends its message without the characters say: ""The weapons are bad, mm\'kay? The series also has a narrow continuity rarely seen in American cartoons; the effects of the previous episodes and the episodes have a well-defined order - unlike some other Disney characters at the time, episodes Gargoyles were generally to be broadcast in the right order. The series is also full of references to Shakespeare (and other things, the first episode of season 2 contains, of all things, a Kafka joke that I did not have * years *) .Gargoyles is really the one of the most interesting and unique cartoon series in Disney\'s safe. This DVD is a great buy for long-time fans and highly recommended for new people curious to know what it is. The first season beautifully showcases the rest of the series and gives the viewer an idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bwhat the show is all about. I\'m already looking forward to future versions of the rest of the series.'",1

Thank you for taking the time to read my review and feel free to leave useful / not helpful comments.'",1
"b'This film was not meant to be taken seriously ... I think what they tried to do here is to relive the experience of the 80s. If you watch this film, you are falsely brought to believe that you can blow yourself up and survive, take a fire extinguisher in your face and get up, and you can pull it 100 times and not hurt you. The dialouge is silly, however, the acting is pretty good. Sit down and have fun / laugh.'",0
"b'If anyone doubts the temporal quality of celebrity, just think of Douglas Fairbanks for his point of view. In his day, the fame of Douglas Fairbanks was unprecedented. He and his wife, Mary Pickford, were considered the royal family of the United States. Today, his wonderful action movies are not only watched by moviegoers, and his face and name are lost to the youngest generation (if Jay Leno\'s interviews are just clues, our youngest Americans seem proud). for the name of the vice president, let alone a silent actor like Fairbanks). What Douglas Fairbanks should disappear from memory is extremely sad. ""The Mark of Zorro"" is a good example of the kind of film that Fairbanks specialized towards the end of the era of silence and was extremely popular because of the dynamic presence of its star. There is really nothing to compare with Fairbanks since his departure from the cinema. No star of action, because it can get closer to his grace and power in an action movie. If you doubt me, buy this DVD and see for yourself. Watch Fairbanks jump over tables, jump over high walls to ride a horse, jump from a table to a cornice near a ceiling, and so on. And it was not just that he was able to do these feats, he was doing them without effort. The pure grace of man was really exciting. He never seemed to empty anything. I realized this as I watched Zorro\'s mark during a scene where Fairbanks lifted one leg and took a galloping horse to rest as easily as if he were descending the ladder. It seemed so easy, I went back and watched the scene again to make sure I had seen what I thought I saw. Yeah, he did it - smooth as silk. Then there is his acting. In this film, Fairbanks plays a duel role: Don Diego, a bland young noble, and his masked counterpart, Zorro. His interpretation of Don Diego is subtle and effective. His body seems shapeless and soft. His manners are distracted and indecisive and vaguely lost. He hates the sword and constantly wipes his face because of his great fatigue. ""When his love is declared"" It\'s not a man - it\'s a fish! ""She hits the nail on the head. Yet when he dons the mask, his body and manners are reborn. His body is supple and full of movement, and his smile, that radiant, radiant smile that radiates pure happiness, is almost as devastating as his blade. Finally, there is the artistic design and scenery of this film. Fairbanks loved these period pieces and spared no expense in research and detail. His care, his financial investment and his dedication to craftsmanship are really revealing. All this has a beautiful ""deep"" feeling. By the way, this review is based on the release of the Kino DVD of this movie, and like all versions of Kino, this edition is just great. May God bless Kino for being one of the best companies that conserves and markets silent films. If you have taken the trouble to read this review, please purchase this movie. If you do, Douglas Fairbanks will again be popular and famous, at least in your heart.-Mykal Banta'",1
"b'This DVD is really great for people who want to tone up. Unlike the 30-day destruction, NMTZ has significantly less cardio (just a little in the warm-up section), which I really like about this DVD. The DVD is divided into sections and you can choose the muscle groups you want to work on. What I like is that she says you can not reduce spots, but you can work on each muscle to get it in shape. You can also play the entire game, which lasts 40 minutes. This is for intermediate to advanced users. [...] I really like that.'",1
"b'A terrorist organization has hijacked some nuclear weapons and is now terrorizing the known world. Sound familiar? Well, there are a few things that make this movie happen. These terrorists all act like shit. In fact, did the ""hero"" (A marine seal rejected with the charisma of a road skunk) wish you to have the terrorists kill him already? Why buy this movie? Simple Leslie Nielsen was photographed on the cover (the Dutch version at least). As a fan of him and hoping to meet an older film in which his acting skills were still appreciated, I took it back. Yes, he\'s doing well. No, he\'s not in the movie for more than 5 minutes. I\'m a big movie fan, but I feel like I\'ve lost an hour and a half of my life.'",0
"b'The MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT multi-film packs are reasonably priced and of good quality. These twenty transfers of unrealized public domain films range from very good to sometimes equitable - none is improbable. The ""legendary detectives"" of this DVD pack are all derived from the 1930s and 1940s. ""The Shadow"" was a half-hour radio series broadcast on 31/07/30. Originally only the narrator of mystery stories, in 1937 ""Shadow"" Lamont Cranston (now portrayed by a young Orson Welles) had become an integral character in every broadcast episode. The 24-year program ended on Boxing Day 1954. The three Shadow films shown here were first seen in 1937, at the peak of the popularity of the radio show. Bulldog Drummond was created in 1920 by the British author Herman McNeile, who published under the pseudonym `` Sapper. The stories of Drummond were directly influenced by the ""black"" detectives then popular in American fiction and are considered the precursors of James Bond. The half-dozen films in this set that feature this character all date back to the late 1930s. ""Dick Tracy"" was a cartoon crimefighter animated by the imagination of Detroit newspaper artist Chester Gould, in October 1931. Gould worked on the bands until his retirement in 1977. 76 years after the creation of the series, other artists still produce these stories. In comics, police inspector Tracy seduced his future wife, Tess Trueheart, for 18 years, before marrying her on Christmas Day 1949. During this period, Tracy in the square jaw ran into legendary crooks. such as BB Eyes, Flattop Jones, Pruneface, Haf and Haf, 88 Keys, Mr, Crime, Sphinx, Pearless and Faceless Redrum. from 1935 to \'48. In the movies, Tracy was mainly portrayed by Ralph Byrd (from 37). Byrd stayed with the series until it ended after a short series on early television. ""Sherlock Holmes"", the most famous fictional detective of all, was created by Scottish author and physician Arthur Conan Doyle. The stories of Holmes were published in various British magazines from 1887. Over the years, Conan Doyle tried more than once to kill the character, but the public clamor made him reconsider. Doyle wrote four novels and fifty-six novels with Holmes and Dr. John Watson, his friend and cohort in the adventure, until the death of the knightly author in 1930.

"b'The special effects were ok, but the story was weak, stupid and predictable. As a child, I loved Alien movies. Aliens (the 2nd) is considered a classic in our house because we continue to laugh at the way my mom rained M & M on the stage after a stranger scared her. So, with that, I was excited to see this movie and relive some memories. What a desappointment. It was not scary at all. The people at the theater were actually *** SLEEPING ***. I was jealous of them. I was especially happy that it was a short film. Unfortunately, the most frightening thing in this movie was a penguin. Do not see it.

"b'This is an interesting movie to discover when you are surfing on channels, but not a DVD to rent or own. What can you say about a movie where the hero massacres hundreds of people but can not save his wife or be burned to death and yet manages to save a cute puppy. It\'s not so much a science fiction movement on a futuristic \'Orfordian dystopia\' as it is a recipe for how to make a sci-fi movie about a futuristic `` Orwellian Dystopia. ""Watching this movie was a lot like playing Trivial Pursuit. It was more pleasant to try to choose the different ingredients of the recipe than to watch the movie. Take Fahrenheit 451; add considerable aid from 1984; just a pinch of Brave New World (the ""injections""); add lots of Matrix special effects; add enough shoot \'em up action with a variety of weapons (for more flavor, stir in a samurai sword fight); and just a slice of beef cake with a Christian Bale scene without his shirt. Mix well and cook in a crematorium (this future company incinerates not only books but works of art and social misfits) to 451 degrees until everything is done, then apply a delicious deep-glaze of existential depth (many characters are looking at each other). The corners of their eyes and two of the characters quote Yeats ""He wishes the fabrics of the sky."" Top with a maraschino cherry of a happy ending (like the one from Fight Club) and you have Equilibrium. the premise of the film is that after an apocalyptic war, all mankind is run by a single government in which a figure of Big Brother maintains total control and total compliance. In order to prevent conflict, all feelings and sensations are removed by constant monitoring and medication injections. People who violate the dictated norm are tracked down by ""clerics"" and eliminated by incineration. The character of Christian Bales is one of the ""clerics"". ""He is a single father of two and his wife was cremated. He is a great cleric, but as the film progresses, he begins to doubt what he is doing. In the end, he searches for underground resistance leaders who are literally forced to live in a secret room. filled with a clutter of paintings, books, old toys and bric-a-brac (not unlike a modern teenager\'s room). Inspired by a young woman he has in custody and a cute puppy, he joins the resistance. In short, after a career of killing and cremating people, they will remain drones without emotion and will not kill each other. The character kills people and blows things up so society can be free to express their emotions and everyone starts to kill themselves and blow things up.'",0

Yes, every image, the terrorist gag, the firearms where they should be, the musical score of the farewell scene found in its original splendor, and no digital scramble. What a delight ! Many thanks to Mr. Spielberg for finally recognizing the deliciously imperfect perfection of his original creation. I have seen this film approaching 70 times and I know where the beats are, from top to bottom. I was looking for changes and I could not detect one. Even the slight jump when AND indicates that the closet is restored. The original ILM animation of bikes in flight is back. The passage of the strings during the last hug is just where it should have always been. All terrible sabotage has been suppressed. The transfer, from 35mm original elements, is as perfect as possible. The appearance and atmosphere of the theater fill the eye and the ear and, as always, the heart.

"b'This will be considered a classic horror in the years to come ... a horrible and classic example of how Hollywood money can destroy a very good story. The plot, what is there, does not resemble the story of Shirley Jackson\'s psychological horror. It\'s pieces of land that make no sense and dead ends. There are a lot of special effects and CGIs, which were probably supposed to compensate for this missing story. They do not do it. Nothing here is scary unless you think of dusting the hilarious wooden cherubs. The sets for the house were the best, they were completely weird and unreal and were well worth seeing. Liam Neeson appears to be blackmailed and Owen Wilson, with a fixed smile rather than the wooden cherubs mentioned above, acts as if he were in a comedy from the start. The women, Lili Taylor and Catherine Zeta-Jones, do a little better given the material they have been given. Zeta-Jones certainly looks good, colorful and all that, but we do not give her anything to do except to walk in search of bright colors. Bruce Dern and Marian Seldes seem to be having fun as gatekeepers, but they were probably just happy to have such small pieces. It does not look like a ""good"" movie, and it was not really worth hating, except that it destroyed a book that was both scary and intelligent.'",0

"b'Robert Harmon\'s ""The Highwaymen"" is a quick and striking ride that takes you into the first mounts and will not let you go until it makes you vibrate 81 minutes later. As a Rennie, Jim Caviezel gives another moving performance as a haunted husband who watches his wife get run over by a jigsaw puzzle driver and spends years chasing the guy. Caviezel\'s role is not as demanding or as satisfying as his performance as Catch in Angel Eyes, but it\'s done well. Colm Feore of ""Riddick Chronicles"", ""Paycheck"" and ""Chicago"" threaten the disabled driver whose only pleasure in life is to terrorize and kill women with his car. I watched the film with an occupational therapist who had a lot of comments on the representation of the disabled. Rhona Mitra, the TV star who shone in ""Party of 5"", ""Gideon\'s Crossing"", ""The Practice"" and now ""Boston Legal"", is doing a great job. pursued, frightened and retaliated. She shows several levels, actually more demanding than her appearances in ""The Life of David Gale"", ""Sweet Home Alabama"" or ""Get Carter. Frankie Faison, who plays the traffic inspector, has released 4 films this year and is a very busy actor (White Chicks, Cookout). His police detective is a little slow to grasp the gravity of what is happening and becomes the complication of Rennie\'s research, but he eventually becomes an ally with the final blow. Andrea Roth, the blonde Alex, does a good job, but in short, before embarking on the windshield of the Cadillac Eldorado. Yes, there are intriguing holes and some jumps in the editing, but overall, it\'s a great little movie tour. Enjoy !'",1

"b'Unlike most other films reviewed, the reviews for this movie are actually quite accurate. The film details the rise of three Ziegfeld girls; The character of Judy becomes famous, the character of Hedy withdraws into a comfortable married life, while the character of Lana ""comes into a nightmare"". The plot is too long and the plot of Lamarr in particular is trivial and uninteresting. These are the numbers on the one hand and the sub - plot of Turner on the other that make this film. The story of Lana\'s rise and fall of fame is the only one that deserves to be seen. This fleshy role was the role that attracted Lana\'s celebrity. Moreover, the numbers are stellar. Some might say it\'s overproduced, but I say spectacular - in particular, the issue ""Out of a Dream"" has the most glamorous costumes ever seen on celluloid. I have never seen so much feminine beauty in my life; the beauty of the ethereal stairs, the ethereal music sung by Tony Martin. You will want to watch again and again.Here are some rogue to watch: 1. In the issue of ""Minnie from Trinidad"", shortly after the mule, we can see a dancer coming out of the camera, in the background - very out of phase compared to the music. The first time I saw this, I could not believe the editor had missed it.2. Watch Judy VERY carefully as she goes down the stairs in the ""Out of Dreams"" issue; You can see glimpses of nudity as she approaches the bottom of the stairs! 3. In the ""Out of a Dream"" issue, all the girls smile except Hedy Lamarr. This contrast is discordant. Hedy Lamarr\'s teeth were misaligned in reality. It\'s an actress who was much more beautiful when she did not smile.'",1

Although I understand that the images are old, I did not know that it would be so bad that most amateur videos look like examples of award-winning movies!

"b""In the 1960s, when filming was still an art form, puppeteer George Pal created what was considered a true classic, The Time Machine. Selected as his hero, the famous Austrian actor Rod Taylor, playing the role of Herbert George Wells, the director accurately portrays an adventurer, but in a bad mood, a gentleman, who works with inventions and aspires to a more peaceful century. . Using what has been hailed as the best special effects of this date, Pal launches Taylor in the future. Stopping only to observe the changing eras where the war is waged with better and more sophisticated weapons, Wells finally arrives in the land of the Eloi. Here, he meets the beautiful and sensual Weena (Yvette Mimieux) and his people. During their brief time together, Weena lets Wells learn that despite their idyllic paradise, it's not without dangers. In this future, it was the Morlocks who became the masters of the world and stole Wells' time machine. Deeply committed to eternity in the future, Taylor engages in a battle against the Morlocks, which will result in a story that he will later tell David Filby (Alan Young) and his Victorian friends. The film is superb and despite being redone several times, has never been equaled. H.G. Wells would have approved. *****""",1
"b""I loved Minority Report. The film attracted me early and took me on a fantastic tour. The story is complex but in a short paragraph, I'll talk a little bit about it. John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the head of Pre-Crime in Washington DC and is charged with future murder. The film then continues in a crazy goose hunt where he tries to prove that he did not do it. Tom Cruise is remarkable in the movie. This is one of his greatest performances of all time. He plays the character well. You feel for John Anderton when you see the movie relaxing. You feel for him because of the good action Cruise does. Farrel is also good in the film. He plays Danny Whitmore, a federal agent trying to see if the crime works. He ends up chasing Anderton in the movie. He plays the character so well. Farrel is doing such good work to hate you. I love that stuff. The special effects of the film are among the best of all time. They bring out some frightening ideas in the film that might be possible in the future. Roger Ebert said: Minority Report reminds us why we go to the movies and I could not agree anymore. It is a cinematic masterpiece and a must for any DVD collection.""",1

Michelle Rodriguez, who has openly declared that she wants to be a gypsy actress, a free spirit, is the most unscathed, simply because you will limit yourself to this kind of career decision. That does not take his hands off this parody. I can not imagine anyone being as rebellious as if she was standing quietly as this pile of raw earth poured around her like rubbish in a dump. And then there is Kristana Loken ... well, you see her nakedness. This is the culmination of his role. And what is Meatloaf doing in this movie ... and credited with its full name? ! He chose this atrocity to decide that he wanted to be credited with two names instead of ONE? HUH? ! Everyone is unknown, which, surprisingly, does not leave many roles for strangers. It was amazing how they have amassed this group of actors named for something so horribly bad. It\'s not just the actors, it\'s the dialogue, the F / X and even the plot ... that escapes me for the moment. I guess I\'m trying to remove this movie from my memory. So do yourself a favor and stay away, stay away, far away. Believe me, it\'s for your good.'",0

For starters, the 15 minutes of footage added are FILMED and awful. In addition, it suffers from lip sync problems that make it virtually improbable. In addition, some original scenes have been deleted. The other disc contains the original not stripped, but unfortunately has a new musical score.

"b'The Italian work of the 60\'s is well known to the British public, for whom the film is also regularly broadcast on television as the James Bond films, The Great Escape and the Queen\'s speech. Negative criticism of American viewers is as much the result of the lack of cultural context and the lack of knowledge of many actors. The film has aged well and offers a fun, if instead of stained rose, snapshot of the British culture.The cast of 60 ""includes Noel Coward as Mr. Bridger, the crime genius, and Michael Caine as fop Charlie Croker. The British public will recognize a host of well-known actors in cameo roles, including Benny Hill and John Le Mesurier. The stars of the film are without a doubt the cars. Pleasantly, the array of 60\'s supercars including a Lamborghini Muira, E-Type Jaguars and Charlie Aston Martin eclipse by the three Mini Cooper\'s who lead the Italian police on an incredible chase through Turin. Remy Julienne and her stunt driving team produced one of the most amazing and well-known films, at least for the British public. It can be said that this rate even more as one of the best car chase sequences and especially since the stunts were actually filmed on site in Turin (and Coventry in the case of the sewer scenes) and cars with minimal changes.There are many memorable moments in the movie beyond the Mini Cooper sequence. Benny Hill\'s big wife was obsessed with Professor Peach in the Turin tram and the end of the hanging was trotting in my head. The extra features of the DVD are good but not really remarkable. The documentary ""Making Of"" provides a number of interesting points of view on the film. The commentary track is a bit surpasses but deserves a listen. There is really only one scene removed, the car balloon ""Blue Danube"" rather amazing on ice. In summary, this is a true British classic with an excellent cast, score and script. A glimpse of the 60s in London, a fantastic distribution (at least for the British public) and the superb car chase scene make it a good buy. The Hollywood remake, while not a bad film in its own right, shares only the title, a scenario based on a gold holdup and the BMW Mini updated with the original.And for all those who Ask about the original Mini, they are really small and so much fun to drive.'",1

"b'28 Days Later is such a well-managed movie in terms of suspense, role-play and meaning that every time I watch it, I am more and more convinced that it will become a classic of science fiction. This is not the case of the ""sequel"", which could be well staged by Fresnadillo, but it is not well structured as a narrative and does not lend a valuable ""message"" to the public. 28 weeks later, they frequently make the mistake of insulting our intelligence. How can you explain that the husband of the woman who survived and who is being held in a health facility can have access to the room where there is no guard, no doctor, no soldier or vigilant staff ? There are no cameras, in a situation where the re-emergence of the virus is feared and possible, after the diagnosis made by the medical staff of the victim. In fact, this is the key event causing the virus violation. In addition, the film is so focused in the bloodbath, the vampire biting and running, that no meaningful dialogue is possible, preventing anyone from understanding the chaos. And what can you say about the helicopter used as deadly power to decapitate dozens of vampire zombies? The least I can say is that the scene is the pinnacle of sensationalism. And by insisting on the meaning of the film, why is something as valuable in the story as the possibility that the survivor or her children have the key to the treatment of the virus is simply lost in favor of a terrible, pessimistic and fatal end? Is it the bait for another sequel, parallel to the ""Alien"" series? Meanwhile, we end up with a ""suite"" that does not properly honor 28 Days Later, regardless of whether Boyle is among the producers.'",0
"b""It's a pity that Bruce Willis can not produce this movie more often. John McClain is probably the greatest hero in the history of film history and this edition features a lot of action and humor. Mc Clain is asked to interview a computer hacker suspected by the FBI. The actor who plays this hacker is the guy who makes Apple McIntosh commercials. It is interesting to note that it seems to prefer a Mac in this one. Anyway, McClain shows up when the hacker is about to be hit by the bad guys. If it was another film, it would be a guy with a magnum or piano wire, but being a Die Hard movie, the villains come with ultra-modern machine guns. Of course, McClain is able to remove some of them and get away with the hacker temporarily. So we have all the assets to create a great partnership with Lethal Weapons movies. The movie encourages you all the time, especially when McClain mocks the villain by talking about one of his main protagonists and telling him I'm coming to get you. Kevin Smith has a cameo bigger than Warlock, a live at home with his mother hacker. It's a role that seems to have been done for him. It's the best Die Hard since the first movie!""",1

Director Oliver Hirschbieger skillfully puts it all together and will keep you at the end of your seat, even though we all know how the tale ended. The film goes under your skin and gnaws your psyche long after seeing it's something. How did the creators of this film accomplish this? By avoiding the usual approach of making Hitler and his murderous thugs two-dimensional cartoon characters, they show instead that they are what they were: humans. Mixed, misguided, fanatical, barbaric and bloody mass murderers - and all in the quest for power (which they have never attained), but nonetheless human. What is sad here, as far as I'm concerned, instead of encouraging his nation to concentrate all its energy to make the world a better place, because the Germans, the Germans, have given us so much more than just beautiful cars and excellent beer and camera lenses ... wasting all this potential to cause destruction and chaos, misery and pain ... for nothing. I realize that quite a few Germans did not care about Hitler and his wacky ideas ... he (once he came to power and they saw where he was actually taking them ... directly to hell) . Any German who opposed the dreaded SS and the Gestapo was dead or in a camp somewhere to suffer the consequences.

"b""Anyone who reads these reviews will have seen the TV production and will know it thoroughly. I will therefore limit my criticism to the quality of the DVD image - or rather to its absence. Too bad that what was once a beautiful and memorable TV movie has become a dilapidated shadow of his former identity. It is painful to see if something that has a special place in your heart is treated so badly. For years, the only version that millions of people had seen on TV had such a pale color and low contrast that it almost seemed to have been shot in black and white! If that's what you're used to, the & quot; restored & quot; the version on this DVD (and the one shown on TV the last 3 or 4 years) seems slightly better, but it is barely restored. Just watch a deleted song in the extras section to see how beautiful and bright the original production was: clean, crisp, immaculate, with very saturated colors. The time and money had to be spent to bring the rest of the film to the norm. It is morally wrong to put a defective product on the market and then have the nerve to charge it. As many of our parents probably told us when we were young, & quot; Everything worth doing is worth it! & quot;""",0

Scott Wiper, who plays his jealous comrade, has happily disappeared after his departure, but the film never says what happens to him. The movie starts with Cain and Wiper (it looks like a law firm, does not it?) In front of some really bad guys who are obviously attacking women in this underwater mining plant. Nothing is ever explained as to why they do it, but Cain kills them all but one, a villain who plans revenge. Meanwhile, many crew members commit suicide and Cain investigates. (Excited again?). Of course, everything ends up as a kind of HIGH NOON submarine when the villain who promised to come back, does it with two other henchmen, and chases Cain around the factory for a while.

"b'I saw this film about a month ago at the local film library. About eighty minutes later, I discreetly looked at my watch and was dismayed by the realization that the film was not even half finished. Celine and Julie go boating? There was no water, let alone a boat, so far. Where was this weird story with repeated scenes over and over again, and when was it going to end? I am a patient movie viewer but it was too much. A number of film critics, whose opinions I usually respect, have practically built religions around their appreciation of this film. I wondered if this could only be the case of the ""new clothes of the emperor""? Almost two hours later, it was over and I emerged from the theater and told myself that I could have seen two real cinematic masterpieces at the time I lost my time on Rivette\'s film ... But in a way, it was not over. The effect of the film persisted. It was not just an intellectual riddle that I had to face, the film was under my skin. The scenes are constantly repeated in my head like a strange dream. Their pace was different from anything I had encountered before. Celine and Julie never complied with any of my expectations - neither did Jacques Rivette. In two separate scenes of the film, C\xc3\xa9line and Julie present themselves to men who, without knowing it, believe they meet the other woman. In each case, the two women completely subvert the worlds of men, digging holes in their rigid convention. Throughout the movie, Rivette was doing the same thing with me. Everything about the film, from its ""intrigue"" to its subtle handling of reality through its rhythm, forces you to abandon your expectations (or to be unhappy trying to retain them). You must relate to the film at your own level, as with a child. Only then can you enjoy it? I do not know exactly why the movie had such an effect on me but he says something of his power that, more than a month later, I still think about it. In recent days, I have had this growing desire to see `` C\xc3\xa9line and Julie go boating \'\' The ideal circumstance for a first meeting is definitely in a theater where you risk turning it off.

He finally meets his parents for the first time. The film also suggests the idea that you can go back in time and help your parents when they need it the most, as Marty certainly tries.

"b'This 1914 film is considered the first feature film comedy ever made and, as such, deserves to be watched for it. The film on its merits is however less interesting. Of course, it\'s slapstick, but I personally found the character of Tillie pretty ridiculous; Ridiular besides without being particularly amusing. She is made to look like - and seems to act like - a guy who drags a fraternity. Marie Dressler, then 45, who played a character as young as Tillie, is less comical than entertaining. In other words, if you take the time to see this movie, you should do it just to see a historically significant movie.

If you have not seen anything of Chaplin, do not start here! And if you are an enlightened fan of Chaplin, you would be better served (if you want to be entertained) by enjoying some of his greatest efforts. For the curious, I propose a brief synopsis of Tillie\'s Punctured Romance: ""What does it have - one of Ringling\'s elephants? \'\' Then notice the character of Mabel Normand (so to speak, in this silent movie) as she watches Chaplin\'s \'City Guy\' with the arm of the hand with `` Like a weapon of war \'\'.

The original was about adventure first, with the accessory ""romance"", and it is an important point, rather lost in this film. This is a ""growing"" teen movie that uses the Thunderbirds as a cover. He really did not need the Thunderbirds part except for the sets. The plot is otherwise perfectly ordinary and can be seen anywhere. The degree of improbability is much higher than the originals and a bit difficult to bear. The game leaves a lot to be desired, and yes, the puppets of the 1960s were often much more realistic than the actors of this film, and Ben Kingsley is not really bad, or even mean. you want a teen movie like so many others, it\'s for you.

I am also aware that writing a review of something here, there are too many ad hominem attacks, not refutations of the review, which makes me reluctant to comment on anything. That said, I must admit that I am very disappointed with this issue of Criterion des Quatre Plumes. I've always thought of DVD Criterion as the best, and I thought the Blu-ray edition would be absolutely perfect, but that's not the case with this one. I own a MGM edition of the film and I find it overall superior to that of Criterion.

Questions to mention: The Criterion edition, although sharper, has a very irregular color transfer, too bright in some places and some discoloration in others. There are no subtitles in the Criterion DVD, but the MGM version has them in multiple languages. I noticed that in many parts of the film, the color fades and the backgrounds seem faded, as if the film had been colored. As I mentioned, please do not personally attack me for this review. If your copy of this movie is better than the one I wrote on, then good for you. I will always return the DVD to Amazon and leave it there. This is only the opinion of a man.""",0

"b'This is one of my favorite movies. This is the typical quality of what I expected from a Criterion reconstruction. Something that looks like HDTV in black and white. It is so good. The story itself is at the beginning of the Great Patriotic War of Russia. The story covers every inch of human behavior, including happiness, love, sorrow, deception, manipulation and heroism against all odds. The last quarter of the film is a staggering surprise, as it is a final scene that is nothing less than a grandiose tribute to the best of what makes us human. Even war movie buffs (like me) can expect a blurred vision at the end of this movie. Not at all, this movie will reach viewers from all countries and most generations. This is not a single-view disc. I do not even know if it has a soundtrack in English, because the tone of the Russian soundtrack combined with very well produced English subtitles offers an excellent connection to the film, even for non-Russian speakers. Buy this record, you will enjoy it again and again.'",1
"b'This film has been among my favorites since I first saw it. Dialogue, stimulation, humor and music have made it a complete package for me.

I would have liked to know the new soundtrack before buying this edition. Although it may work for those who are discovering this movie, it falls flat for this fan.'",0
"b""This DVD is an interesting collection of interviews and reports. That's what you expect. You will see a young Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill.

"b'Spoilers in front, but again, who is not familiar with Casablanca, even if we have not seen it? I\'ve watched \'Casablanca\' again and again since I bought the Special Edition DVD, and is there a movie that you can watch over and over without ever having enough? And does a film attract a wider audience? Everything seems to be as close to perfection as possible. But what is the particularity? Is it his great mix of genres, never equaled by another film? When we think of ""Casablanca"" first, we remember it as a romantic film (well, most of us). But again, it\'s also a drama involving terror, murder and flight. We can call it a character study, centered on Rick. And there are some moments of comical delight, just think of the pickpocket (""This place is full of vultures, vultures everywhere!"") Or the elderly couple the last night before their emigration to the United States (`` What watch? `\'). But \'Casablanca\' is not only great as a whole, it is always up if we divide it and look at lines of dialogue, scenes or performances alone. Is there another film that has more dialogues than ""Casablanca""? I\'m thinking of Pulp Fiction, All About Eve, and Sunset Blvd. ""Come on too, but I still think that Casablanca surpasses everything. And not only is the dialogue great, it\'s unforgettable, especially by Humphrey Bogart (""I was misinformed"") and Claude Rains (""I\'m shocked, shocked to see the game going on here""). Many scenes have become part of the film\'s story; The duel of \'Die Wacht am Rhein\' and \'La Marseillaise\' is probably one of the biggest scenes ever shot (the only one I can think of that would be Hynkel and Chaplin\'s Globe \'s The Great Dictator\'), and the last scene is probably familiar to the few who have never seen Casablanca. Am I the only one to be absolutely convinced that the film would not have become what it is today if Rick and Ilsa would have been in a relationship? About the performances: So much has been said about the singularity of the chemical composition of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman as Rick and Ilsa, the tremendous turning of Claude Rains as Renault, performances of Peter Lorre (one of the 10 most great actors of all time) like Ugarte and Sydney Greenstreet as Ferrari and about Dooley Wilson stopping the show as Sam. I\'d love to point out here two other performances, one that is not mentioned as often and that is ignored : Conrad Veidt as Major Strasser had a really difficult task here, because his character is the only evil one, but still Strasser is not a one-dimensional character, and it took more than 50 years before another actor gives an impressive performance (maybe even more) as a Nazi, Ralph Fiennes in \'Schindler\'s List\'. But why no one ever mentions S. K. Sakall, who embodies Carl, the merry server of Rick\'s Caf & oacute; Follow & oacute; Rican, is beyond me. He has much more time on the screen than Lorre, Greenstreet and Wilson, and probably about as much as Veidt, and it \'s a joy every time he is on screen. I just like his reaction when the pickpocket (`` The vultures everywhere! \'\') The accidentally hits, or the reaction to the newspaper `` What watch \'\'. Or how he says he gave Strasser the best table, ""being German, he would have taken it anyway."" His performance is simply neglected. Is there a weak link in ""Casablanca""? Each film, so close to perfection, has one or two minor defects, so we can find them in ""Casablanca"" too, if we really make efforts. So, yes, one might wonder how much gibberish makes sense for transit letters. It can be emphasized that Paul Henreid, although his performance is certainly good, does not come close to the size of his co-stars. However, the film is so close to perfection that I am almost ashamed to try desperately to find less than perfect elements. Whatever the upcoming movie, how many suites will spill over the screen and how much scrap it will have to sit, something is certain if we want to see a great movie desperately: we will always have Casablanca!'",1
"b""First, let me tell you that I loved the movie. I liked it so much that I bought a digital copy to download and keep on my Kindle Fire. The problem arose when, according to Amazon's technical assistance, DreamWorks decided not to make enough sales in the DVD domain and blocked this content from streaming content on what it called a blackout period. .

"b'This is the first Star Trek movie where people of the next generation are featured. Some original characters are also involved. This is where the descent begins. We are initiated to the tri-lithium substance, which can kill suns. The data finally receives human emotions and the two captains get to work side by side. However, they turn the 1701-D into a weakening of a ship, pulling it out by a single strike (not even a salvo) of an obsolete and dilapidated Klingon scout / prey class (as Mr. Chekov l would have called) which was faulty while he was on duty. I realize they wanted a known set, but she should have died harder. And the death of Admiral Kirk was not enough to do him justice. It was supposed to be a transition movie, but the first generation, even if it did not really come out with a groan, certainly did not go out loud. It was more like a groan.'",0
"b'Dumbo is a classic Disney film, emblematic in its imagery of pink elephants and the poor little elephant with ears too big to integrate into the elephant society. This is a very sad and bittersweet film, Dumbo being removed from his mother, who walks away for his lost son. Dumbo has to find his own identity and find a way to not get blamed all the time. Originally released in 1941, Dumbo has a short duration of 63 minutes. The special features of the Big Top Edition far outweigh the functionality. There is a game that teaches children circus animals, a storybook, two long songs, a video clip, several Disney short films. Apart from the commentary track and short films, few things are interesting or interesting for the adult. The real problem with this new edition ""Big Top"" is that it is not very different from the ""60th edition"". There is a different music video, adding a feature and losing others. The quality of the film itself is not radically different from that of the previous version. Honestly, Dumbo is a Disney movie to own. But that makes no difference what edition we buy.-Joe Sherry'",1

"b'Mike Leigh\'s films are all improvised; almost all are interesting. They are generally cherished Oscar, and ""Vera Drake"" is no exception. I will not mention the plot, because if you read this, you already know it. Imelda Staunton is indeed beautiful. I only recently saw the film and, last year, at the Oscars, I thought it would win because of the slug-fest that seems to involve Swank & Bening, the only times they were involved. I thought the votes would be shared, as often happens. Imelda was gracious, glorious, gentle and down-to-earth in this performance, a veritable amalgam of acting prowess. Mike Leigh also used Brenda Blethyn wisely in ""Secrets & Lies"". A great story and an interesting part of the story, this movie is wonderful, especially with respect to the other characters involved, all excellent. Mr. Leigh is brilliant and he uses the female characters well; I hope he will soon move away from this improvisational tool that forces women to cry and cry. Imelda\'s moans were annoying, but in ""Secrets & Lies,"" Blethyn was distracting. Still a nice demonstration of acting, and a good person with good intentions, unfortunately against the law. I am pro-life, up to a point; I have almost understood Vera\'s motives, especially with regard to rape. In the early 1950s, frivolous behavior was not as accepted as now and Vera was there to be a friend. The film deserves to be watched. Its historical importance is invaluable.

"b'Web sites that analyze the positive and negative reviews of major critics have a positive score of at least 95% for Ratatouille, which puts it clearly at the top of the 2007 films. Is this the best movie of the year? No, but it is the one that attracts the most, because almost everyone will consider it a positive experience. The ratatouille follows R\xc3\xa9my, a curious rat who aspires to be more than a garbage thief. Remy\'s keen sense of taste and his taste for food draw him into the culinary arts. By stealing what he can from an elderly owner who enjoys cooking shows and books, R\xc3\xa9my becomes a loyal member of one of France\'s most famous chefs, Auguste Gusteau. After Remy has learned that Gusteau has been dead for years and has watched rebroadcasts of his television program, the little rat begins to be guided by Ben Kenobi by the spirit of the deceased chief. which was taken over by a naive capitalist who uses Gusteau\'s image to sell frozen burritos and corndogs. Using a young cook as a support, R\xc3\xa9my tries to rebuild Gusteau\'s reputation and make his restaurant to his glory. The resulting action is an often charming story of a rat so dedicated to achieving his goal. Many laughs are found when his family comes in search of documents, and the chief antagonists (the owner and a food critic) create real moments of danger. Remy is really a movie ""hero"", someone dedicated to a cause that, according to him, will make the world better. Although lacking the heart of Toy Story movies or the comedic genius of the first Shrek, Ratatouille continues the trend of the revival of animation that has provided some of the best films of the last decade.'",1

"b'Originally released for Christmas in 1935, this beautifully produced, atmospheric and beautifully presented film showed the flair of M-G-M for the filming of literary classics - DAVID COPPERFIELD was released earlier this year - with no expense spared; The sequence of the Bastille employed several thousand extras and was filmed on one of the largest Hollywood sets. Ronald Colman was reluctant to play Sidney Carlton, that charming but dissolute lawyer who sacrifices himself the most. It took a lot of persuasion for Colman to get rid of his mustache for the role of Carlton, but he more than likely delivered his best performance (later in his life, Colman admitted it was his personal favorite of all its roles). Charles Dicken\'s 17th century classic Paris and London and the events surrounding the French Revolution were shot in silence on four different occasions, twice in Britain and America. Under the meticulous direction of Jack Conway, A TALE OF TWO CITIES delivers memorable performances through a fine cast, including the wonderful martyr Blanche Yurka, the frightening Lucille LaVerne, the Edna May Oliver vinaigrette, the despicable Basil Rathbone, the eloquent Henry B.

When I looked at the performances of the time, I felt guilty for abandoning Buckley in his later phases, but it takes maturity to appreciate this material that I did not have at the time.

I had high expectations for the movie (the book was great ... how the movie could not be), but was completely disappointed. I gave him two stara because the fact that it was partially true to the book (except for all that was left out) is a rarity in book-based movies these days. As everyone likes to discuss, I think it's worth throwing my two cents. My opinion is: WHY ARE ALL PEOPLE SERIOUS? ? ? ? That's all it is ... a story. Do not people understand that this is a fiction novel? Brown never claims that this story is completely true. It presents facts throughout the book, but mixes them with fiction for one purpose ... to make an interesting book that will sell. This film / book was a good fictional story ... I will stop preaching now and leave you with my advice ... read the book if you want to get wrapped up in a very interesting FICTIONAL story. If you have a few hours to kill (and do not like to read) and you have absolutely nothing better to do, take a nap (do not waste your time with the movie ... read the book).

"b'What can I say about this ""story"" not inspired by Bret\'s first novel? The adaptation of the film does not contain the scenes and tone that I felt had made the book so captivating and memorable. (The dead boy in the alley scene, the snuff movie with the minor girl ...) We can not say that this movie is based on the book - it\'s rather inspired by the novel. Despite this fall, the film deserves to be watched by any fan of Bret Easton Ellis - if only to satisfy his curiosity. The movie contains neither the depressing one-liners nor the confusing minor characters that make the book so interesting The Sisters of Clay, Spin) The film gave the impression that Julian was the protagonist, while I still felt that the novel was to see the events unfold before Clay\'s eyes. One of the most endearing parts of the novel is Clay\'s ""flashbacks"" before he leaves for school. The movie only talks about that at the beginning, and the flashback is about Blair, not his parents, who were the subjects of the flashbacks I found most interesting. The lunch scene between Clay and his father is pure genius. The detachment between father and son made me cringe. This scene is not included in the film at all. Unfortunately, film adaptation to books is almost always lost in ""translation"". ""American Psycho"" is really the only one of the films adapted from his books that, in my opinion, captures the tone of the book while compacting it in an inaudible story without losing Bret\'s style, thanks to the fact that Bateman himself is the narrator.Everything, ""Less Than Zero"" is not really a bad movie. Just a bad adaptation. It captures what was both awesome and forgettable of the popular film of the 80s, and matches any entertaining teen drama from that era (including the extravagant consumption of cocaine by the miners, New Wave, where Are They Now\'s future star) , James Spader). There are moving moments, but it seems that the film has tried to find a conclusion to which the book did not succeed (and had a reason not to do so). After all, Julian does not die in the novel, and Blair certainly does not return to Camden with Clay (Morrissey would not be proud). allusion also: how much Clay is upset, apathetic and lost now that he has changed and acquired a new perspective, while his friends, unfortunately, have not done so. And a serious complaint: Where is the Disappear Here panel? It is an integral part of the novel \'s imagery and is absent from the film (unless I miss it). All: If you\'re a fan of Bret\'s books, give a shot to this movie. It\'s worth a look at once, but do not be upset if he\'s just trying to capture the mood or purpose of the novel.'",0
"b""The excellent GHOST movie works mainly because of f / x and the refreshing staging of horror legend Tobe Hooper.

You must really respect how much of the Beatles\' musical legacy has been incorporated into this effort. Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr have made some of the greatest music of the 20th century and besides being a good film, Across the Universe really highlights that. The power of songs comes to life at every turn. Imagined in an original way with a beautiful artistic direction and a cinematography, Across the Universe skilfully weaves the Beatles in the socio-political context of the time when the songs were written. Hats off to the director Julie Taymor and the team who thought very well and the excellent cast that sings all better than you would expect. This is quite an achievement, since it could have been disastrous or badly done.

I loved ""Dances with Wolves"" and ""Jeremiah Johnson"" and really enjoyed ""The Last of the Mohicans"" and ""Last of the Dogmen"", but none of these great movies compare to the absolute. realism portrayed in ""black dress"" .This is a simple story set in the early seventeenth century ... a story of a French Jesuit priest who was commissioned by his canoe superiors to a Huron post 1500 miles away (with help the Indian Scouts and an interpreter) and help convert the Huron to Christianity, thus saving their souls. In this movie, the protagonist is not a superhero who makes no mistake, shows no weaknesses, can shoot and pull out any living man. On the contrary, he is only a young priest full of self-satisfaction, ignorance, fear and doubt. But despite that (or because of it), his bravery is really unmatched. This is a story of people fighting for their lives every day against the breathtaking hardness of nature and other Indian tribes. It is also a story of conflict between two very different cultures. This is shown with a strange subtlety, but the effects are devastating. `` Black Dress \'\' goes where few movies have been before or since.

Is it possible that when they say that the film is by Takeshi, they mean he produced it? I am so naive and annoyed by their misleading information that I could almost scream. If they had not lied about the distribution, I would not have bought it at all. It is obviously a television drama badly shot with a lot of action, actors of quality and a somewhat confused plot. If it's a sequel, I guess that explains some of the problems because people come in and the main characters know them, but we do not know who they are or whether they are good or good. both according to their actions. At one point, they are all gathered in a giant row forming a giant sword and I had no idea who they were or how Wind had come to help the villain. I also did not realize that Wave was Cloud's brother (I think) until much later in the story. If I had known since the beginning, it would have been much more emotional, but maybe because I was so bored that it exceeded me! ? When Wind becomes a demon, there is no explanation as to how long or when it becomes normal again or even how. He is with Mung, his wife for a minute and not the next, she adopts a boy and then he is never seen again until it is his word to warn him inadvertently that the master has a cold. It's just a mix of scenes thrown together that leaves you wondering how he did / had and so on. I would not recommend this movie at all. It is filmed more like a soap opera, has this video and it is simply edited horribly. I was bored waiting for Takeshi to appear, thinking maybe he was nameless, but I could not even figure out who was nameless. Maybe if they had followed that, whoever they wanted without name, it could have given more punch. A perfect way to waste time.""",0
"b'Lewis Gilbert \'s masterpiece in 1983, a sensitive and emotionally satisfying adaptation of Willy Russel\' s intelligent and insightful two - character game. Gilbert and Russel team up for the wonderful ""Shirley Valentine,"" but their work in this film remains unmatched.Michael Caine gives one of the most memorable performances of an illustrious career, disappearing in his Frank character, and Julie Walters is as beautiful as Rita / Susan, David Hentschel\'s music is perfectly appropriate, Frank Watts\' cinematography is inspired, the screenplay is both touching and honest, but the magic of this film lies in the interaction between the two characters. This film shows the journey towards self-awareness embodied by education, as the character of Rita / Susan evolves from hairdresser to student, intellectual, diligent and finally very different from the beginning of the film, but undeniably and only Rita . & quot; The best gift we can give to another is the love of learning, and I think it\'s one of the greatest stories s love never devoted to celluloid. The end could be & quot; as inevitable as tragedy, & quot; according to Willy Russel, the relationship between Frank and Rita made their emotional journey interesting and we are all richer for their trip.'",1
"b""If Daniel Barenboim is not the greatest living classical musician in the world, he is certainly the most versatile. During his career of more than 50 years, his name is associated with many famous recordings of opera, symphony, small ensemble and solo piano. With the last half of his career marked by the distinction on the podium, we can forget that he is still an accomplished concert pianist. Here, we are treated with both talents when Barenboim conducts the Staatskapelle Berlin and plays the five piano concertos of Beethoven. In the accompanying booklet, we find that Barenboim recorded these works for the first time in 1967 at the age of 24 under Otto Klemperer. Now he revisits them 40 years later on the occasion of his 65th birthday. The challenges of serving as conductor and soloist are undoubtedly considerable, but Barenboim, fully played from memory and without score, makes it easy and natural. Although he is fully engaged in his role as a soloist, Barenboim never loses the command of the orchestra. Sometimes his direction is in the momentary freedom of a gesture of the left hand. At other times, it is the subtlety of his nod or the speed of his eye. The Staatskapelle is perfectly in tune with these nuances and their game is always at the rendezvous and without hesitation. Among the many highlights: the wonderful piano-clarinet exchange in the Largo of the first concerto, the Rondo Vivace's narrative of the fourth and all the beauty and majesty of the Emperor. The performance was recorded in front of a live audience during a three-day piano festival in Bochum, Germany, in 2007. The concerts took place in the Jahrhunderthalle, which presents an architectural design from an old steelworks. The minimalist interior with high ceilings and exposed steel beams gives up the traditional elegance that adorns many concert halls (and the stifling pretext that accompanies it). Aesthetically, the Jahrhunderthalle is a place of comfort and clean lines of sight above all else. The sold-out audience appreciates and respects the music. They are often in sight, but rarely heard (even between movements) until their applause at the end of each job. They are intelligently (if not formally) dedicated people who know classical music when they hear it. Some of the performances took place during the daylight hours, allowing the large back windows to cast a beautiful natural light on the audience and the performers. more enlightened by soft stage lighting that showcases musicians and their instruments where it's needed and without difficult shadows. The 1080i Blu-ray image is almost perfect. Skin tones are natural and attractive. The color of the instruments and the dress of the public is exact, without bleeding. The ivory keyboard is correctly exposed and balanced with a lot of resolution to distinguish the keys. The black levels are strong without losing any detail in the folds of the musicians' jacket. The close-ups reveal the polished brass of the French horns as well as the fine grain of the basses and the violins. Barenboim is rightly the center of attention and one can see the delicate frizziness of her hair and the sweat beads that start to glitter on her forehead by the third movement of each concert. The PCM 2.0 audio track is clean, but the piano is not rough above the top C. On the contrary, the DTS HD-MA 5.1 track, by opening up the surround of the rear channels and a wider sound stage, delivers a magnificent sound warm and spacious, devoid of any discordance in the upper register. The piano is correctly centered while the sound integrity of each orchestral instrument is presented with distinction according to its location on stage. The full program runs around 3:20. There are no supplements except for a handful of trailers from other versions of Medici Arts. An interview with Barenboim, rehearsal footage and a brief history of the venue would have been good, but unfortunately, opportunities were missed. In the end, this is the only thing missing, because it is, in any case, a most appreciated release and another great achievement for one of the most distinguished artists of music classic.""",1

"b""This is an unusual film Merchant / Ivory dedicated to the Indian community of Trinidad from 1943 to about 1954. It focuses in particular on a young teacher, who marries a woman, steals his clever father, and lives in the countryside , just wanting to write books. However, he has to make a living, so he becomes a masseur, who is not a masseuse, but a healer. He also writes a book on Hinduism, which he publishes himself. He becomes known as Mystic Masseur and develops a country as a result. His book and the following books are quickly bought by a now adorable public who reveres him as a pundit. A brief career in politics soon follows, only for him to discover that an adoring public can become inconstant. The film meanders, just like the life of this expert. With world-class cinematography and exceptional performances from all the actors, it's a very good film, although unusual. Those interested in other cultures will find this film interesting. If you are not so inclined, deduce a star from my criticism.""",1
"b'I admit that I have never seen Mario Bava\'s films. I only recently entered Italian cinema with the films of Dario Argento and other Giallo. Until now, I had never tried a bava. So, hearing about this movie and being intrigued by the premise, I took the DVD. The premise of the movie is that four criminals rob a payroll of pharmaceutical companies during which the leaky driver is killed. The three other murderers flee to a parking lot where they take hostages, one of whom is killed to flee. Subsequently, to avoid being spotted by the police in a familiar car, they retreat and take more hostages this middle-aged man and a sick child. At this point, the movies were a violent crime movie. When he gets into the car, the film is mainly focused on driving criminals and their hostages. What is good about the film despite minor flaws is that even in its form (neither Rabid Dogs nor the re-edited Kidnapped have been completed with the support of Bava because of the circumstances that earned its ""lost"" status until \'to recently) suspended suspense thriller building his tension slowly. As tensions mount in the car and victims plead for their lives, even criminals start to turn against each other. One wants to rape the woman as a hostage, while another goes along with what happens when the leader is more concerned with getting to their destination. There are moments in the film that seemed great to me in a transgressive way, namely that the new movies could not even get close to the head. And in the end, I do not want to spoil it, but if you get so much into the plot, it will certainly surprise you. I was totally blown away by the movie. One thing is also the feeling of anger that infiltrates each image. This is a brutal film to look at sometimes with his portrait of a world that is vain and arrogant in the face of the critical situation of the hostages (especially the child). For me, it\'s a movie that can almost be compared to one of my favorites, Ran de Kurosawa. Unfortunately, I only saw the Rabid Dogs carved on the new record of Anchor Bay. It also contains the edition of Lamberto Bava Kidnapped more in line with the intentions of his father that I will look into the future but which has been disabled for the score of the synthesizer (I love the harpsichord and the organs in Rabid Dogs.) And did not want to watch the movie so soon after seeing it. Another recommendation from me, which is worth the detour.'",1
"b'Being a big fan of vampire / horror and a fan of Bloodrayne video games, I decided to give this movie a whirlwind. All I can say is ouch. The action scenes are laughable. The actors move in slow motion, without coordination. I guess this is due to a low-budget combat choreographer. And the blood! This movie must have the blandest blood we\'ve ever seen ... Tough im giving this movie two stars for its extreme violence. Decapitations and others are so exaggerated and ""funny"" that their appearance is comical.

"b""As many commentators have said, it's a light-hearted yet irresistibly funny film that's just wonderful to watch. No sex, no violence, just a funny story about an employee who finds dance as a key to freeing himself from his bored existence. The music soundtrack was just beautiful - every song matched every scene perfectly. I was fortunate to have been able to get a copy of the soundtrack while traveling abroad. In any case, I found that the plot was much more appealing and intelligent than your classic Hollywood movies. Rather than dropping Sugiyama in love with the original girl who had drawn him into the dance hall, he discovers the joy of dancing and his liberating power that has brought him closer to his family by encouraging him to show his affection and his love more openly. directly.

"b'If it is true that the once brilliant ""soap"" suffers from major creative problems in its fourth and final season (why is Burt suddenly the healthiest member of the family?), Virtually all comedies airing today his bold mix of comedy, drama, romance, suspense and pathos. Season 4 offers many memorable television moments, less than the previous three seasons, including Burt\'s faith crisis, the hilarious presentation of El Puerco and his Juans, Chester\'s touching and belated realization. Jessica, the steamy wedding of Eunice and Dutch, and Mary \'s struggle to keep her sanity in the midst of real madness. No Show today is even close to ""Soap"" even in its weakest season. What Sony did in the fourth season is dreadful and mysterious. While his presentations of Seasons One to Three were technically banal, much of it, due to such modest sources, at least the episodes remained intact and were featured on ABC and VHS from Columbia House in the years 1990. For some reason, Sony opted here to edit the fourth season of ""Soap"" by summarizing most of the pre-episode recaps (""In the last episode of"" Soap ""... were pretty smart and none was consuming anymore 40 seconds later Worse, Sony has released the last five episodes of an hour of the season in half-past ten, omitting whole scenes and essentially consisting of highly edited syndicated versions of the series (I do not know if they are indeed the syndicated versions of these episodes, but they differ significantly from the episodes as they appeared on the Columbia House bands, which offered episodes s uncut as they appeared on ABC in 1981). Complete and in-depth versions of `` Soap \'\' Seasons 1-3, this incomplete and poor quality packaging of season 4 is a real headache, a disappointment and a value for fans who simply need to have the whole series on DVD.

It's more like a film about a woman who does not get along with her mother, who is popular on her radio show and her marriage is in danger. Then there are things about a woman in Poland who left her diary to her daughter. It's not a good movie, no matter what tags you put on it, because the game is bad and the scenario is worse.

Non-Israeli hostages returning home - A Catholic nun insisting on staying with the rest of the hostages. All these memorable scenes, which I was eager to see again, are GONE!

The whole cast shines; no doubt, it\'s the best work you\'ve seen from Melanie Griffith and Bruce Willis.

"b""This workout was great. I finished it about 15 minutes ago and I can really feel it now. The workout is divided into 5 segments of 10 minutes, which is a format I love because it means you can break it down for a shorter workout and even if you do, you do not feel like an eternity because of the change. segments. The general idea is to do strengthening exercises followed by stretching to lengthen the muscles. Segment Overview: Arms: This was probably my least favorite segment. I prefer the arm segment over 10 minute solutions to a perfect body. There was about 6 to 7 minutes of work on the arms and 3 to 4 of the stretching of the arms. He felt rushed and the tracking seemed a little off the mark. Moreover, I did not find it very difficult. For this segment, you need light weights. Weight: This segment was excellent. They claim that you need a chair to do these exercises, but if you have strong enough thighs and a good balance, it is not necessary. These exercises make you feel your thighs, mine began to shake like crazy at one point and are really effective.Glutes: I think it was the most difficult segment of the DVD. I really like the fact that they have dedicated a segment specifically to glutes, a lot of video through them with thighs and I do not think they work very hard. In this segment, you will work hard, and a chair is an absolute necessity. I had to take several breaks during this time, but I can not wait to work on the full segment.Abs: I'm glad this segment was short because, even if it was a good job for the abs, Was a bit boring You put your feet on the wall and you stand in a sitting position (do not think it seems difficult, nor did I do it for about 8 minutes), then make variations from there. Not my favorite workout, but effective, I really felt my abdominals get tired. Stretching: I like it a lot when DVDs have a long segment dedicated to stretching. That said, it was not my favorite stretch segment. I wish the stretching was a little shorter and there was more stretching. It ended and I still felt the need to do other sections to feel really extended. But the stretches they have done have been good and there is something to say to hold them so long and your body will really relax. Overall, I definitely recommend buying this video. It's a really effective workout and I certainly liked all the segments to keep doing them even though they were not my favorite. I also really liked the fact that they had two instructors, a man and a woman, and that they showed simpler variants of many movements, including when it was better to rest if necessary. One of the things I have not mentioned (and this is a personal preference) is that the instruction is a voice-over that is not my favorite and that I sometimes felt that the tracking was not ok Final Thought: For $ 15 Worth It!""",1

Of course, I had recorded it on a VHS with other Christmas classics, but the quality was not great and we had to endure the commercials.

The jokes are better and even more brutal. The embarrassment that runs through Jim are hilarious (well god the scene super glue). The girls are hotter. And Stifle maybe just a little too much, but is still much better in part 2. When he grabs that dildo and shakes it running in this house, I could not help but laugh.

"b""Alice Walker is a great pioneer. She is one of those African American women who deserve all our love and worship. She explores in this film and in the book, the slow and progressive liberation of black women from their auxiliary slavery. Everything must start in their heads. They must find the courage to develop their own personality and their freedom in the closed prison of their skulls, then, little by little, they find the strength and the power to resist men, then to society, then to excel. Liberalization is a mental process that finds its full power when it becomes public and considers society as the natural field of its realization. The film is moving, moving, sensitive, intelligent, sentimental and extremely powerful, even the most universal language we can imagine, the language of the liberation of women as the first step in the liberation of humanity. Alice Walker is universal in this story and she deals with the world and with every human being. Moreover, no one is lost, no one is left on the roadside, no one is lost forever for the cause of liberation. Even the worst tyrant will find in his moral depth the idea and initiative that will make him free with others, as well as those he has embodied for decades. The husband pays the immigration of the African husband and family of his wife 's sister. And he does it for nothing at all, because he stays away and does not claim his due.

"b'First, I have to be clean. I first saw Full Metal Jacket in its original theatrical release. About everything that stayed with me, there was the scene in the head that ends the second third of the film. I bought it on the recommendation of my son, a newly appointed second lieutenant in the Marines. He calls FMJ the ""marine film"". ""He also calls the time period"" a shameful chapter in the history of the Marine Corps. "" ""The routine abuse of recruits described in the film no longer occurs. Nevertheless, the film is right on both counts. Marine training, even thirty years later, is as demanding as Kubrick describes it. The goal is the same: to create ""indestructible (and now female) men"" who can kill as many enemies as possible. The experience of the Marines in combat, especially in Vietnam, is as shown in the film. While following a training that would qualify him to lead a platoon, I interviewed my son about the incident that led to the second cold-blooded murder. Would it have happened that the Marines are so lost that they would be at the mercy of a sniper?

Her parents are too busy to do anything with her, and her neighbors are either crazy or boring. The only exception is Wybie, a boy who does not annoy him. It\'s the kind of relentless world that any little girl would want to escape - until Coraline does it. She meets a plastered door and a colorful wormhole, leading to a new caretaker. In fact, he is so similar that she has ""other mother"" in the eyes of pimples (Teri Hatcher) and ""another father"" (John Hodgman), as well as good food, games, a shimmering magical garden. , a choir of circus rodents and magic toys. First of all, Coraline is fascinated by the other world, especially since her other parents are as attentive as her real parents are not. Then she finds her real parents sealed in a mirror. With the help of a sarcastic cat, Coraline returns to the other world. But with her parents and a trio of dead children taken hostage, Coraline\'s only hope is to play with her own freedom - and she will be trapped forever if she fails.

The horror is subtle, the delicious flippancy is not.Coraline - Alice in this country of the Low Countries - is a wonderful little heroine: strong, sensitive, self-sufficient but still quite frightened by what is going on around she. Normally, I\'m not crazy about Dakota Fanning, but the voice alone is very good in this role. The sarcastic cat is a wonderful counterpoint, and the original character of the film, Wybie, is a good companion. And the other mother is the stuff of nightmares - she is totally inhuman and ruthless, and by the climax of the movie, she is having nightmares. Oh, and the French and Saunders make a pair of funny cameos like the kooky neighbors. ""Coraline"" is a brilliantly dark little movie, filled with dark magic and strange creatures - definitely for Gaiman fans, dark fantasy and really scary stuff.'",1
"b""In my review of the album Fallen, I quoted Lemmy from Motorhead, saying that the album was above expectations. The rest of the quote was that he thought they could not make it live. Well, I do not agree with Mr. Kilminster for seeing the World Domination tour on his Australian course. I must say that the group played on the spot. And this CD shows that they can actually fill the sound mix, just like on their revolutionary album. The sound is good, the band is tight, which is interesting given the personal dramas of the time. The noise of the crowd seems to have been introduced gradually, although the situation is fairly regular. The main difference between these pieces of Fallen and their live versions here is that the sound is a little resounding. Putting a live album when you have next to no back catalog is a bit cheeky. It also serves to bridge the gap between their albums - the aforementioned staff changes have undoubtedly played their part. It's not that filling the time between albums with live releases and curiosities is a new idea (G'n'R Lies someone?). For fans of this group, this is probably an essential listening. The songs sound good, the public loves and the projects are nice. Three stars for the strength of the songs and because there is no huge overdub. The fourth star of the extra DVD group highlights. They also sold the DVD separately for a while though. Make sure you already have this version with the DVD because it's really worth it.""",1
"b""4.6 starsI love this movie, and think the script and Ford do justice to the original TV series, rightly adored. I do not think this blu-ray transfer does justice to the original copy, though; Although it's a good sharp picture, it's not really an improvement over my DVD. The film itself is an excellent adaptation of the series, and the Big Pharma conspiracy angle is an excellent update that works well. There is a lot of thrills, with a minimum of violence, that I enjoy every year more, because filmmakers and foolish writers rely on firearms and blood to fill holes in their ill-conceived plots. There is more intelligence than that at work here, and director Andrew Davis makes everything resonate with suspense. The end is a bit weak: I do not buy the stage at the conference, but it works to the extent that it has to, and that's enough. Add Ford and Jones to the top of their games and it's a movie. It's worth looking at several times, every time you have to remember what a real thriller might look like. Too bad, they have not perfected enough to be a blu-ray worthy of the description high definition.""",1
"b'The problem with New Moon is that it takes itself too seriously while giving the public many reasons to consider it as a joke. I try not to read too much in films and I believe that people are responsible for their acts agree that this film also has an influence on girls and older women. I was in high school once, and a lot of dialogue was like what I remembered hearing from friends. You know, the day you had a big crush and they were the love of your life? Then 3 weeks later, you move on to another love of your life. ""That\'s how the dialogue sounds. It\'s silly, exaggerated, and I\'m sorry for teenagers who think that\'s what it should be. Edward and Bella have an obsessive and addictive relationship. Spilled by a vampire then you feel suicidal? Really ? If you take out the vampire stuff, everything else is always wrong. Bella is a mopey, without emotion, without humor, without base, completely empty of personality shell. It\'s really hard to understand why these guys find her attractive. What is she doing ? For her or for someone? She is a major drag and she treats her father like shit. It\'s just not believable that two guys are ready to die (one more) for her. She offers nothing in return. She is thrown by Ed and just eats the attention that Jacob gives her without intending to return her feelings. We call this leader. Everything is on it to the maximum. What I found particularly amusing was that she asked Jacob if he could just stop being a wolf ... But that same girl would never ask Edward that. It does not mean anything . Lautner did the best game of the three and made me feel Jake. I read the Wiki page of the book Breaking Dawn and the result of his character looks like a movie recipe for a disaster. At this point, producers must stop directing little girls. He honestly saved the film. As an adult, I can only manage so much teenage anguish and the fact that he has cracked a few smiles prevented me from extinguishing it. But even so, the werewolf scenes were the best. The makeup of the vampires was terrible and the contacts entertaining. Pattinson was better in the first film. Stewart was the same non-entity. She was so unreliable. Even if it\'s not in dialogue, manners, facial expressions, and actions can convey a lot of things about a character. It\'s hard to believe that Bella is not a robot. Even on the cover of the DVD, she just does not try. Compared to the two male sons. Actors should be able to sell the motivations of their characters. Stanley in ""Streetcar"" was totally wrong, but Brando sold it. Stewart does not, so Bella is one of the least deserving ""heroines"" to hit the screen.'",0
"b""Good movies on the & quot; Great War & quot; (as was known before the Second World War) are rare. After & quot; Everything is calm on the western front and & quot; Paths of Glory & quot; the list is quite short. This film does not quite fit these standards, but it's still an excellent film. In general terms, the film is quite precise in terms of the representation of the battles of the First World War. Battle scenes are also close to & quot; Save Private Ryan & quot; level of realism that you can get on commercial television. Be warned that some scenes, especially the & quot; friendly fire & quot; Artillery attack, is not for the squeam.The support is a colorful and original collection of characters, devoid of most of the usual war movie clich\xc3\xa9s. You could not watch a character and say if he would be dead before the end of the movie. It was easy to imagine that these characters had been ripped off a street in New York around 1918. Rick Schroeder gives a first-rate performance as a deeply confrontational Major Whittlesey, torn between doing his duty and the well-being of his men . where the film hits a wrong note. Whittlesey's car at first was probably not built for 15 years after the end of the Great War. The scene where the major receives his orders seems to ignore the military protocol. And in a major issue of continuity, Whittlesey's executive office talks about the wandering artillery barrage that occurred that day, when it had happened the day before.""",1

The cast includes many big names on both sides of the Atlantic, such as Denzel Washington, Emma Thompson and Michael Keaton, and the heroine is Kate Beckinsale's first big release. The dialogue in the film remains faithful to the original piece and the frame is probably as close as possible to what Shakespeare had imagined. Best of all is the music; classic style but original composition. I enjoyed watching this movie again and again and you too.""",1
"b'This DVD has my favorite soundtrack for this movie, however, it is out of sync with the video! (which destroys it) The selection of chapters is also wrong: there are only 4 chapter selections to choose from; chapter 2 is titled chapter 1, and so on ... so there is no selection for chapter 1. The title menu is also extremely cheap, showing a small picture of the DVD case cover on a background closely resembling the old background image of ""blue sky with clouds"" of Windows 95. Finally, the quality of the video is bad. This is probably not worth taking unless you plan to remaster the DVD with the soundtrack in sync with the video for personal use and with a decent chapter selection menu. .

"b""Uwe Boll has become a kind of joke among genre fans. With titles such as Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead on his resume, the German director is synonymous with hack-work crapfests. These are the weakest brands of the horror genre. I guess we, the fans, have a hard time tasting so much of Boll's pursuit. In interviews, I would be much more willing to reduce it. It's one thing to make a terrible film and defend it through a delusional assumption that it's good, but another to try to cover up when you know you're doing dreck. I'm waiting patiently for Uwe's fierce defenses on Bloodrayne. As in all those quickies based on half-cooked video games, the plot is irrelevant. This is not to say that a downhill story could not have been produced about Rayne's character, but she certainly fell flat on her face here. The script is the first culprit. It's about something I wrote in Grade 10 English class. Every shot imaginable is exposed. It's as if the writer Guinevere Turner had an encyclopedia of banalities. I guess the excuse might be that she's new to this kind of room, but come on. The world is not descriptive and full of incongruous things with its old world. But despite these anachronisms, the dialogue is only stiff, the old world speaks with humorous dislike to the contractions of sentences. The different machinations that give impetus to the actions of the characters are always vague and unimportant. There are very few actors with whom actors can work. No one here seemed to give a shit, which is understandable. There is humor to be had in the clumsy and stitched deliveries of many actors. It almost seemed like some of them (Michael Madsen and Michele Rodriquez, obviously) were reading for the first time the dialog box of a landmark map. Udo Kier and Billy Zane have useless rolls (though Zane manages to take advantage of some of his exceptional qualities). Ben Kingsley sits in the same chair for three quarters of the movie, barely reacting to someone telling him. And Meatloaf, well .. I find myself a little un-splashed by his short sequence in the movie. All I would say is that it was a wig. Come on, is there anything good? I would say that Kristanna Loken is really hot. It is hard to say if she can act because there is no dialogue worth reciting and no director can push her in the direction of a performance, but she really looks like imagine Rayne. The gore, especially on the Unrated version, is rather lively, though a bit awkward and unconvincing. There is a big troll..which is never really explained..and..uh..ah, I would just like someone to give Uwe Boll career advice. Maybe he could be a choreographer of the fight scene, he likes them, or he could try to be a production assistant, go back to the top, relearn how to make a movie. Heck, he could be a scavenger for all I do not care, someone just tells him to stop making movies. In this way, all humanity could benefit.""",0

"b""The Forbidden Planet is perhaps the preeminent work of science fiction in the 1950s. It is not science fiction at all, but it is a thoughtful and intelligent offer in its own way. Fortunately (but very vaguely) based on Shakespeare's The Tempest, it's a movie where there are so many potential layers of meaning you want to find. With Morbius as Prospero, and Prospero, in turn, most likely based on the Elizabethan mage, Dr. John Dee, co-creator of the magical Enochian language, is it really a coincidence that Morbius himself is a linguist? There is much more that I would like to say here, but I hold back for those who do not already know the film. I do not want to give spoilers. For those who have seen the film and are prone to such exercises, I will simply ask them: who - or what - would you assign the respective roles of Ariel and Caliban? How would you adapt your answers to the larger themes of the film? And what do your answers suggest about how the mind and the material were conceived in the minds of Elizabethans and Americans of the 1950s? Just to think. For those who have not seen Forbidden Planet yet, I would first and foremost say that this is a great movie that works perfectly on a simple adventure that a 10 year old could enjoy. . As a sci-fi piece, I would only point out that such depths are more than science; although the classic science fiction themes of the 1950s are interpreted in a metaphorical form. Fortunately, the reds under the bed / saucers in the sky metaphor that has become such a clich\xc3\xa9; One thing I want to add before moving on to something else is that this film deserves to be seen only for the scenography. Whether you consider it classic or dated, it's up to you. but for me, I will simply say that I have never seen the visual lexicon of the science fiction of the 50s express themselves more completely. So, too bad for the movie. How about the DVD? Well, I'm happy to say it's great! The quality of the image is beautiful, and there are lots of extras and very good too. We receive tons of promotional material, including detailed behind-the-scenes information and even an extra children's movie that also uses Robbie the Robot as an accessory. Incidentally, because I have seen written reviews for editions or versions other than the one for which I originally wrote them, let me emphasize that I write all this on Forbidden Planet (Special Edition Two Discs ). you check my profile of criticism, you will see that I am not one of those reviewers who distributes raves five stars like sweets. But if you're interested in classic science fiction, it's a movie you MUST watch. And if you're looking for the best possible DVD version, to my knowledge, that's it. Theo.""",1

Dennis Hopper was a wonderful villain and the characters are very friendly. I want to give a boost to the audio part of the Blu Ray - turn up the sound when you watch this because the quality is really staggering. Very realistic, nothing exaggerated.

In the days that follow, the two men form a sort of difficult camaraderie, and the conversations between them seem to help alleviate some of the racial tensions they show towards each other, to a point of respect for everyone.

The illustrations are clean animations of the first order and easy to follow during action scenes. Good story also very deep considering the audience for which it was intended. In short, a very good purchase in my opinion.""",1

"b""I am very disappointed with this movie. Mainly because it seems that we are talking about two different subjects at the same time. On the one hand, the film interviews experts in philosophy and theology, who retrace the history and progression of postmodern thought quite effectively. On the other hand, there are two filmmakers who simply discuss their pointless and sometimes irrelevant discussion ideas. The Williamson brothers pose questions that have little to do with postmodernism and more with their own discontent with the church. It's as if they're doing this film to cast their own ideas and advertise them as a film about postmodernism. Although some interviews with experts are useful for clarifying the trends of postmodern thought, this video as a whole is useless as a whole.""",0
"b'The Bride With White Hair 2 quickly followed the success of the original film, taking up the tragic story of Cho Yi-Hang (Leslie Cheung) and her forbidden love Lien Ni-Chang (Brigitte Lin). By betraying his sacred commitment never to doubt his beloved, Cho has unleashed a monster. Ni-Chang\'s fury over Cho\'s betrayal makes her completely mad, turning her into a white-haired witch who only lives to destroy all the living members of the eight clans, especially the Wu Tang clan to which Cho belongs. As for Cho, he retired to Mount Shin Fung, keeping a mystical flower whose blooming (and flowering only once every twenty years) can cleanse and restore the woman he still loves. Ten years have passed since the night of death Chang went crazy and almost destroyed the Wu Tang clan alone. Only two members of the clan survive: Cho, who stands guard at Mount Shin Fung in snowstorm conditions for all these years, and the nephew Kit of Cho (Sunny Chan). With Kit\'s impending marriage with Lyre (Joey Maan), the possibility of continuing the lineage exists - and this is how Ni-Chang blocks the group, kidnaps the bride and brings her back to her own private castle full of men -the deadly women. There, Lyre is indoctrinated in the witch\'s philosophy ""See a man, kill a man"" and programmed to kill Kit with his own hands. The eight clans send their best warriors to try to kill the witch and save Lyre, but they are almost all helpless against Ni-Chang, who uses his deadly hair as a very effective weapon (it sounds odd, I know, but it works really good). It soon becomes clear that the only person able to defeat the white witch is Cho Yi-Hang, which opens the way to an unforgettable meeting between the two former lovers. This sequel is a more direct, action-oriented film than the The original Bride With White Hair, and for this reason, I found it more pleasant on the surface. Yet, it lacks the depth and beauty of the original, largely because the two lovers do not meet face to face until the final scene - even if this meeting is well worth the wait. Most certainly, if you have seen and enjoyed the original, you will want to experience this suite.'",1

"b""I was really looking forward to the Dinosaur episode of Disney's animated epic. After all, it would be eight and a half years. I do not know exactly what I expected. Do I think that the recent explosion of graphic technology will lead to a corresponding breakthrough in film narration? If so, I had to be naive, because what the Disney powers decided to do was take this dazzling technology and graft a story that would be a recovery from those used in some of their past success. The dinosaur proves that playing safely is not always the best solution. The opening is spectacular. A flock of dinosaurs graze peacefully. We see a mother watching a nest of eggs. Suddenly, a huge carnasour emerges from the woods in search of a dinner. In the chaos that ensues, only one egg survives. What follows is a spectacular series of events in which this egg is transported to a distant island and is populated with mammals rather than dinosaurs. A family of lemurs finds the egg, and it is here that the film begins to disintegrate. Lemurs begin to speak, and this is the first time words are used in the film. I did not expect Disney to make such a different film that none of the characters spoke, but I was surprised to find that they had been taken directly from King Lion and Tarzan. It's as if the African jungles were primitive to Disney World, as if things were happening millions of years ago, it's beyond the imagination of anyone. I can not emphasize enough the beauty of this film. This shows us that CGI technology continues to grow at a breathtaking speed. The camera flies through wonderful landscapes, the dinosaurs are fantastic to watch and the colors are wonderful. One scene in particular, in which the world of dinosaurs is almost destroyed by a spectacular meteor shower, is one of the best animated sequences ever produced. When it comes to history, I wonder how many Disney chefs have children. . One wonders if they make decisions based on the children they see around them or the focus groups. Has he ever thought that anything that fascinates children is not necessarily cute and cuddly or even safe? When I was young, for example, I fell in love with the ocean, not because I thought it was hot and safe, but for deeper reasons, I could not express. I'm not sure what children today think of dinosaurs, but I doubt they consider them as big old puppies or creatures of Judeo-Christian ethics. In this film, the dinosaur that lemurs save is a dinosaur that teaches his fellow creatures that the survival of the fittest is wrong and that's all it's all about. In one way or another, I do not think the average child will buy his arguments, not with respect to wild creatures. I think they will find his preaching a little tedious. Assuming kids take everything and translate it into a fantasy world, Disney underestimated the intelligence of its younger audience and demonstrated that it may have become a bit disconnected from its target market, at least in which concerns particular subject.""",0

"b""First of all, you can not watch this DVD if you are some kind of weird politically correct. Each stereotype, of the metal head, the religious father and the teacher of gender studies, is strengthened and pitilessly beaten with a brutal sarcasm. So, if you could be offended by that, do not look at it! ! ! There, now, if you can take things with a grain of salt, and you like extremely ruthless comedy, then Dirtbags is the movie for you! You get a group of burnout college students, each trying to reach a specific goal in life (usually involving sexual favors with women), and get involved in wacky situations that there are usually no loopholes . in absolute degeneracy. I'm sure there is some type of thesis in this area for all college students there ... maybe we can never achieve their goals by dishonest means? Oh, I do not think so. It probably does not make sense, but it does not matter! And you have to love the characters, all so colorful and so strange that no fiction could ever create them completely. These are real images out of life ... In fact, I have seen male gender studies teachers and Ogre-gym type men, so it's stranger than fiction. As I said, this movie is politically incorrect. No, I'm doing it again; it's the ANTI-politics policy. It's great to see that someone went to the extreme and completely ridiculed the politically correct, exposing him to the absurdity to which he was brought. If there are no other redemptive qualities of this film in the eyes of the general public, it is at least social criticism that makes South Park as docile as Sesame Street. Random and artificial graphics (the skeleton of the pizza) The men romp on the campus, the bee sinks into the soda can, the girl gets tied again and again in the river) adds a touch of weirdness to the film B and demonstrates the ingenuity of homemade movies. Personally, I find that very well. Scenes of random nudity are, in my humble opinion, more haphazard than burrs on the part of the viewer. Why is there a nude woman scene for several minutes? Because it's random and so stupid that it's kind of fun. However, I have to subcontract a star for two reasons: first, the fact that this DVD has no chapters selections (you can only watch the movie until), and two, the sound. With sound, there is always music, and sometimes it overflows the dialogue (extremely boring!), And because of the low budget, part of the dialogue is not recorded expertly. When I looked at it, I did not really understand it, but when I looked at it a second time, I cracked hysterically. Throw a monochrome Peter Steele of Type O Negative, a fantastic soundtrack including Immolation, Candlemass, and some wacky songs, and you'll have a real treat! ... if you're not afraid of not taking this seriously.""",1
"b'This film is excellent and deserves five stars but this release on DVD has the same problem as the first version, and as I bought both in this studio, I have the right to complain.

Reversing a disc is something I have not had to do since the LP disappeared.'",0
"b'When I was little, I could not get this movie, but when I heard a lot of positive reviews about this movie, some saying it was the best Disney movie, I decided to give it another shot . So, I bought the DVD, and now it\'s starting to grow on me! I now fully agree that this is the best Disney movie I\'ve seen! No wonder this movie has won 5 Oscars! Songs like ""Chim Chim Cher-ee"", ""Spoonful of Sugar"" and ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" will always be in your head! It will always be the best character of Julie Andrews, regardless of the number of his films. She does a perfect job with Mary Poppins and yet she can really sing! No wonder it\'s so good on Broadway! I believe that Walt Disney has made a perfect choice to hire Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins! Dick Van Dyke ROCKS! He\'s really funnier than ever, playing like Bert, and yet he\'s also a great dancer! I really laughed when he laughed at different stages of the scene with Uncle Albert. Another perfect selection made by Walt Disney! The special effects were perfect! I learned that Cherry Tree Lane was actually on stage, but at first I thought it was in London! This is without a doubt the best set I have ever seen. Plus, I was really surprised when they wanted it to look like a Broadway scene! I really thought they did it when they did the song ""Step in Time"", which had a really perfect energy, and there were no accidents, which really surprised me! I was also impressed that when the Nannies were blown by a strong wind and that Mary Poppins flew to and from the Banks\' house, or all of Uncle Albert\'s sequences, or all the scenes in which they fly, you CAN NOT see a single thread! The sounds of fireworks were perfect on the mixed 5.1 edition! I can go on and on, but I\'m out of ideas! The backstage and trailers have been a perfect aid for the Disc 2 edition. He also has a new short film called: ""The cat who watched the king. ""While having a correct title, this short was very good.It would be a shame not to win an Oscar.I give this film a solid + 10 / 10I gave this DVD a solid +10 / 10 to have a Perfect video and audio presentation!

"b""this DVD collection is great despite what the amazon guy said (who saw him again). I thought the characters were perfectly developed. it is not necessary to prolong the evidence. they tell you what he does and why he does it. Is not that enough? or do you like exhausting plots like akira? Although there are funny phrases in the story, they are not at all dark. The crazy turnings that are given to vampires (like implanted vampires and vampires with crosses) give this set a unique feel along the way. The only thing I thought a little strange was the theme song of the opening and closing credits. it does not correspond (in my opinion) to history. It does not really matter since it's only for about 30 seconds. Another thing I liked about this anime is that the English dubbing is excellent. I'm not one of those animators who likes to watch subtitles rather than the movie and it will not disappoint those of you who feel the same way. I give this series a 5 to extreme violence, gore, adult situations and great animation / dubbing. enjoy !""",1

"b'I was really disappointed with Sneiders Perfect Rebounding Workout. I bought it because I wanted an alternative to Urban Rebounding compilation DVDs. The first sign of trouble was at the beginning of the tape interview, which showed the host, probably Dr. Sneider, a huge potato. This is not the model I was looking for. To be honest, if you do the workout on this video, you\'ll have a good workout. But the video is so repetitive, completely devoid of enthusiasm, downright boring and unprofessionally produced. For the bouncing part, there is very little movement, not very imaginative, again and again. When you move from one movement to another, the camera almost never focuses on the teacher\'s feet to see what she\'s doing, so you can only guess. The ""class"" consists of a group of people totally helpless and struggling with rhythmic difficulties on the lawn of the Royal Hawaiian Hotel. They do not exercise in unison at all, and the camera is usually on them, not on the teacher. You must have hand weights to do the program. For the abs part of the program, the cameraman forgot to focus the camera. The two people are only fuzzy. In addition, there is no need to do abdominal, yoga or pilates on a rebounder. It\'s totally uncomfortable to do it and you can get a much better workout by doing them on a mat, without hurting yourself on the rebounder\'s frame. Although the exercises in the abs and yoga sessions have been good, I strongly recommend getting a different DVD from those who do not bounce, like Yoga Candlelight (very excellent) with Sara Ivanhoe. It has many of the same gestures as the yoga part of this training, but safe, well taught, photographed in a professional manner and, above all, ENTHUSIASM. It was just a very, very boring and repetitive exercise video. Urban Rebounding compilations are not perfect, but they are MUCH better.'",0

"b'An amazing film made in almost impossible circumstances. In Paris, in the 1840s, along a district of theaters (the ""Boulevard of Crime""), the story is about a mime (played by Jean-Louis Barrault) who falls in love with a ""woman of experience"". \'\' - played brilliantly by Arletty. In an incredibly poignant and delicate scene, Arletty asks Barrault to make love to her, but he does not seize the moment and he leaves her. She finds lust in the arms of others. Other main characters include a degenerate philosopher / writer; a Shakespearean actor; a rich account that ""keeps"" Arletty; and the woman who loves Barrault and finally the wife. But the love between Barrault and Arletty remains true over the years, but in the end, after spending a glorious night together, she leaves him permanently. The acting is superb, but what makes the film a masterpiece is the writing of Jacques Prevert: the dialogue is just great. The film was shot during the Nazi occupation and many actors left the plateau to fight in the resistance. The sets were constantly moved to avoid Nazi bombing and interference, as far as possible. The film lasts about 190 minutes; the Nazis had a law that no film could exceed 90 minutes, so this was done as TWO independent films. The film is not only a testimony of love in all its intensity (it\'s a French film after all), it is also about the survival of a country and a big city, Paris - a whole civilization, in reality of a fierce oppressor: it is the light of love and culture and the memory that always shines from the darkness of hell. An amazing feat in all phases of the production process, from the message of history to the scenery, staging and photography: it is a film of all time.'",1

"b'I have been practicing yoga regularly for about a year. I am familiar with Vinyasa flow and Hatha yoga, and enjoy both. Unfortunately, Sybel\'s yoga was a disappointment. I kept thinking that she did not know what kind of yoga she was doing: it was a concentrated pose like Hatha, but the pace was extremely fast (faster than most Vinyasa I did) and there was really no flow to the movements. She jumped directly into the poses without focusing on her breathing, and instead of moving to warm the body, she began with stretching poses. This confusing pattern continued throughout the DVD as she moved from strength, stretching and relaxation to seemingly random. Each pose was held for only 2-3 seconds before continuing, and the reminders for ""inhaling, exhaling"" were far too fast for a good calming yoga breath. Although Sybel mentions in his opening speech that his yoga is for people of all levels, many of the poses included in this DVD are too advanced for beginners and would require a lot of modifications for someone who is not in fine fettle.'",0
"b""Well, I saw that in Costco yesterday and I took it because it's one of my favorite movies of my childhood. My little brother and I used to rent this VHS to our local rental agency every year towards the start of the summer vacation. The film itself is ideal for a TV movie, it is just as good if not better than the animation of the series. The show itself has five stars, so why did I give it two stars? . . The quality is zero. If you put it in a computer and you check its size, it is only 3.7 GB, not even an 8 GB DVD. So they used the cheap method and used a single layer DVD. You can tell it when you play it because it is an interlaced DVD, interlaced Google DVD for more information. Basically, it's for playing on old TVs, not on today's HDTVs. It also seems that they used an old VHS for the rip instead of using original sources or even a LaserDisc, these record-size DVD discs, they were of much better quality than the VHS and did not degrade with the time as VHS. If they pulled off one of those, it would look a lot better. They also do not have much time to create menus, when you go watch trailers and change languages, it's a light blue menu without any sound. I could have done a better job with free software on the menus. In addition, the records were made in Mexico, they could not even splurge to make them in the United States. I'm glad it's on DVD now, but for something I've been waiting for a long time, I'm upset is so low quality. I can improve the quality a bit by tearing it up and using a Decomb filter to eliminate the intertwining, but why on earth could not they just bring out a better product? I also know some people with LaserDisc players, I could just buy the LaserDisc of this product and have it rip for me, burn it to DVD and put it in this case. The case is nice and looks good with my other DVDs and Blurays.""",0

The video offers a series of on-screen explanations of basic yoga postures with a small graphic. It is very difficult to read on the screen, the colot is too light and helps very little. The video is very good for those who have been practicing yoga for some time and have a good understanding of it. I tried all the programs contained in the video, without being able to follow the movements, and very little knowledge on how to do it.

Despite the horrible reviews, I decided to give in to the temptation to rent Alone In The Dark (I had a free rental, so I thought there could be no loss). It was even worse than I expected ... First, creatures that are liberated from the depths of darkness - or any other clich\xc3\xa9 object in history - are pathetic CGI dino-beasts. Something interesting, scary or just ""cool"" about them? Nope . Just useless computer-generated monsters that fail to entertain the public in any way. For two, the acting is horrible. Seeing Tara Reid on the main credits of the DVD made me roll my eyes, but seeing her try to play the role of archaeologist in a sci-fi action movie just made me laugh. Christian Slater is the only decent mid-actor, but that is not enough to cover the rest. And for three, the film is terribly boring, with few action scenes. Oh, of course, some unknown bumps here and there, creatures flashing across the screen, and a little gore is included. But the real action? Very little . The small amounts of action he has included are the reason why I gave two stars to this worst. I hate to see a movie suffer, but this one deserves it. In conclusion, do not make the same mistakes as most of these critics by praising the movie, knowing how terrible it must be. Just trust the ratings on this one. This will save you money and time.'",0
"b'In 1879, a British column was almost annihilated by a great ""impi"" of Zulu warriors near Isandhlwana. Subsequently, a small British force camped near Rorke \'s Drift (a trading station and a mission) consisting of 104 soldiers and a number of disabled in a makeshift hospital became the next target. For two days, the station was attacked by waves of Zulu warriors. The total number of attackers was about 4500. In the end, nearly 400 Zulus were killed compared to only about twenty defenders, the hospital was burned down and 11 victims of the Victoria Cross were handed over. to the survivors. The film itself is a fairly faithful reconstruction of events. at Rorke \'s Drift, with a good rendition of Michael Caine, Stanley Baker, and a wide cast of Zulus. The ferocity of the assault, the stubborn and obstinate defense of the small garrison and the chaos of hand-to-hand combat in the barricades are felt through cinematography. A wonderful aspect of this film is that the battle scenes were shot using a large number of actors in the role of Zulu warriors, who were obviously able to recreate the tactics and movement of the real army of 1879. Their screams of war, their synchronized spear-to-shield movements and advancing formation create the feeling of a real army that attacks the seemingly doomed garrison. This is one of the few films that gives the viewer an idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bwhat the fight must have been at a time when mechanized armies appeared.'",1

"b""That's what you expect from Monty Python guys. It's silly, irreverent and completely strange. Erik the Viking is a black comedy with a light heart, and even if it seems doubtful, those of you who have seen Monty Python and the Holy Grail or Brian's Life will understand. It will never be called a masterpiece of cinematography, action or special effects. Again, this is not done for. The film accomplishes what it proposes to do. The charm of the film is to realize quite stupid situations. Vikings flying from the ends of the Earth to Erik fighting a crowd of enemies, thinking he's invisible. The special effect does not compare much with that of other Python films made in the 1970s and it was made in 1989. The performances of the Monty Python distribution are not the best, but they are fun and satisfying. The thing is not really important. Erik the Viking is a good entertaining story with some thoughtful but subtle observations about the human condition and religion. Even if the darkest things end up not being so serious. This DVD is really hard to find and, to make matters worse, Sony has developed a Cut's Director, but has never bothered to release it in the United States. If you have a DVD without a region, there is a director sound available in the UK, so there is hope. If you find the rare American version for a reasonable price, I advise you to get it without asking questions, because Sony has made no announcement to make reissues. Those of you who do not get Python-esque humor will not appreciate that either. If you like the humor side mixed with mythic Nordic stories (and do not criticize low production budgets), then this movie should be a good diversion of reality.""",1
"b'We all got to know Clint Eastwood through his work. The countless first television shows and Western films in which he played introduced us to him. His role went from Star to Superstar in his epic portrayals of ""Dirty Harry,"" the homicide inspector. Since then, we have seen his excellence as a director in many excellent dramas and westerns. Although controversial, we examined his morality and sense of compassion beyond the cultural senses of morality in Million Dollar Baby. Clint Eastwood directs and plays in a movie where he is retired drinking beer and smoking cigarettes on the verandah, scolding everyone, his neighbors, his wartime experiences and his own family! In Gran Torino, he shows that it is possible to teach an old dog new tricks. Always immersed in hatred, fanaticism and racial stereotypes, he is slowly transformed by his Hmong immigrant neighbors. As he takes a young Hmong teenager under his wing (although at first he was made to protect the only thing he really likes, his vintage, 1972 Gran Torino state), he keeps young Thao away from aimless Gang-Bangers and ""Mans"" Thao.

The only drawback of this DVD is that you are missing these elements. Support independent music that is part of the revolution!""",1
"b""When a nuclear submarine suddenly falls in the Pacific Ocean and a hurricane prevents the army from being able to send a crew after this operation, it subcontracts an underwater drilling team near Bud Brigman (Ed Harris ). To help the drilling team, the army sends a SEAL group of the Navy led by Lieutenant Coffey (Michael Biehn) accompanied by the designer of the underwater oil rig and his wife Lindsey Brigman (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio ). But as they search the nuclear submarine, they realize that the sinking of the submarine may be bigger than expected, and that Lieutenant Coffey believes that the Russians are responsible, the crew believes he could there is something more ... supernatural There are few directors who really know how to outdo each effort as James Cameron does. His first film, The Terminator, set a precedent for action movies in the 80s, and he only stood out with Terminator 2. With Aliens, he made a film at least equal to Ridley's Alien Scott making a suite that changed the mood and style while respecting the original. In 1989, James Cameron directed The Abyss, a film that took place mainly underwater and was shot in the largest underwater ensemble of the time. The set, built in a half-finished nuclear reactor facility, included 7 million gallons of water. So, among the other achievements of Cameron, how is The Abyss? The Abyss is certainly Cameron's most underrated film. By watching movies such as Avatar, Aliens, The Terminator and Terminator 2, it's easy to see how a film like The Abyss can be forgotten, but if you take a closer look, The Abyss works well with others. Like Cameron's other films, he shows great attention to detail, with amazing special effects. On a technical level, the movie looks like real life, something that is always great when it comes to a Cameron movie. But as with Cameron's other films, it's not about the special effects but about the human element. Cameron does a great job of humanizing his characters and developing their relationships. The game is phenomenal, of course, I would not expect anything else from a movie including Michael Biehn (The Terminator, Aliens) and Ed Harris (The Truman Show), The Rock). Biehn is doing very well as a soldier who has lost contact with the outside world and must make calls for his next move, and that drives him crazy. Ed Harris is great as a hard ass leader looking for his ex-wife who keeps running away without him, and Marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio is awesome as the aforementioned wife who gets stuck with Bud and his repulsive crew, but grew up close to the husband she had left and the crew he manages. If you have not seen this movie, but you like Cameron's other movies, I strongly recommend you to give this shot. I would say that this movie is perhaps even better than The Terminator, and since I think the Aliens are better than The Terminator, I think it's exactly like Aliens. Give it a shot, it's definitely a sleeper classic that deserves more exposure than it gets.""",1
"b""(5/3/12, 1 star for this Blu-ray release, 5 stars for the movie) I have the regular DVD with English subtitles, which StudioCanal has inexplicably omitted from its Blu-ray version. Why would they do that? Earn a few more dollars? Apart from hardness, it is surely a wrong financial calculation on their part. There are countless moviegoers with less than perfect audition who are likely to skip this release. My wife is a non-native English speaker who needs English subtitles to catch all the dialogue, especially when the actors have British accents. She will not be watching the Blu-ray version, and since we're always watching movies together, I will not do it either. I suppose there are millions of viewers around the world who feel the same way.""",0
"b""Madacy did it again ... took what could have been decent DVDs and turned them into garbage. The video transfer of the film is very mediocre, but the worst is the sound. Madacy has always been behind low-cost, low-quality DVD production. Just look at other reviews of Madacy titles (check out Charlie Chaplin's DVDs). It's a shame because young people who have never seen these classics can make mistakes.""",0
"b'It is a remarkably bad presentation of the ""great battles"" of the Second World War. At first, in an alleged introduction to the causes of the Second World War - probably written at a time when the Soviets were to rejoice in 1946 - the authors DO NOT MENTION THE GERMAN-SOVIET PACT OF 1939! ! ! ! The rest is a superficial, long and boring collection of news and other images, with sound and rudimentary texts. To avoid .'",0
"b""It was the franchise that slugfest fans thought never happened except in comics. After years and years of unsuccessful attempts and false starts, the powers finally come together. In the hope of capitalizing on the surprising success of merging two horror franchises with Freddy and Jaso, two of the most popular science fiction creatures compete in Alien. Predator with those annoying humans caught in the middle. There is no clich\xc3\xa9; that this movie does not like. Disposable characters are widely drawn. For example, a bottle cap worn around a character's neck is considered a characteristic feature. The film even manages to include this old chestnut where the characters exceed the explosion of a fireball. Fans waiting for the two extraterrestrial races to start beating will have to wait nearly an hour before their first battle, but it's impressive. like something in a comic book. Certainly the fight scenes are pretty cool in all their CGI-assisted glory, but that's hardly an endorsement. Poor Lance Henriksen is here a selfish businessman who provides the only human link with other Alien films (implying is the inspiration for the bishop android in Aliens). It may be only a quarter of the film before being shipped quickly. There is an audio commentary by writer / director Paul W.S. Anderson and actors Lance Henriksen and Sanaa Lathan. They are connected to the game, seemingly unaware of the narrative mess that constitutes this film. An audio commentary by visual effects supervisor John Bruno and creator effects creators Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr is also included. Anyone who likes to listen to such details will find this track informative. at Dark Horse 's Alien vs. Predator.Alien Series vs. Predator was not worth the wait and fans of the comics would feel cheated. The film begins slowly, but once the Aliens and Predators begin to fight, the weak scenario and the clumsy plot disappear in the background. It's a shame because these two extraterrestrial races are ripe for countless story ideas that the following sequels have not been able to exploit effectively. All we have left is a beautiful painting film by numbers.""",0
"b'This dvd did not look like the novel, the characters were combined and the story was told out of sequence. It was bought as a teaching tool to accompany the novel in a special needs class, I could not use it for this purpose.'",0
"b""I do not know where these other criticisms come from (they are identical to those of drunken wu tang). This movie is NOT Drunken Wu Tang. I bought it under the impression that it was. Even IMDB says it's the same thing. This is not to be fooled. There are not even the same actors! ! ! ! ! ! ! The IMDB webpage is incorrect! The information page on amazon is also incorrect!""",0
"b""Very weak . Half of this video is shot in an aquarium. The quality is marginal and even the fish seem to know how bad it will be. It's a completely amateur production. I do not know the inspirational messages, I disabled this feature after the first, which was not an inspiration.""",0
"b'I was terribly excited to discover that one of my favorite classic films, the 1963 Peter Brooks ""Lord of the Flies"" was on DVD, I was even more excited when I saw that He had received a luxury treatment from a studio called Criterion. ""Lord of the Flies"" was the first DVD I bought and he introduced me to the phenomenal Criterion collection. DVD is fantastic and interesting, there is no compliment or praise without meaning.The comment alone is worth the price of this DVD, it gives a magnificent overview of how this film was made: for example, the film was one of the first independent productions ever produced and is one of those rare comments that adds to your appreciation and understanding of the film Seven Samurai & ""Grand Illusion & quot; (also both Criterion dvds) comments among the best I\'ve heard them The movie itself is absolutely fantastic, worlds better than any vhs or laserdisc edition I\'ve ever seen; The criterion has produced an astonishing and crisp image that will strike any video. The lord of the flies is one of my favorite novels; Golding has masterfully touched many themes and concepts of society and has managed to capture the essence of humanity in the boy caricatures he created. For the most part, these themes and ideas are very faithful to the movie. As stated in the DVD commentary; there is no credit for the script because there was no script, the production team worked directly from the novel, using it as the sole source of the story. The result is a remarkably clear and coherent adaptation of the original novel, animated with great faith and surprising feats for a novice filmmaker. Some technical limitations can still be observed in the final product, but they do not reduce the pleasure of your film. In short: a fantastic, dark and captivating story is brilliantly animated in such a way that it sometimes seems to look at the viewer as a documentary in progress. Finally, to top it off, the film received a royal treatment on DVD that perfectly complements and improves the film itself; in all, the price of entry is very high.'",1
"b'the film is bad ... just like that. To say, the photography, the custom, and the decorations are good, but the story is really lame ... also, the action sequences are null (funny almos) ... and the end .. uffff ... please ... I just fast forward the movie so it ends earlier ... I really like the game ... but the movie is zero'",0
"b'OK, I read the book in college and I fell in love with it! I had to read several times. I recommend it to all my friends. When, years later, I heard that they were making a movie, I was so excited! I jumped literally up and down. I could not wait to see a new Werewolf movie and my favorite book no less. I thought it would be great it would be the # 1 box office! So I dragged my friends to see him on the opening date. The first thing I noticed was that for an opening date, the theater was not very busy. I thought, ""Well, maybe people did not understand the title. \'\' Less than half the time threw the film my mouth just open in disbelief! It was an ABOMINATION! They slaughtered the book with their misinterpretation of the book and used horrible effects! They did not pass directly from the man to the wolves in the flash of bright light! And I almost cried when I saw the end! It was completely the opposite of the book! He used a silver butter knife to stab it! ! ! ! All this film missed the torment, the feelings and the fight that Vivian went through at the end of the book. I strongly suggest to people who have watched this movie to read the BOOK! I wanted to go out of the theater so many times if it was not for my friends. I cursed all the time I watched this horrible movie! He made my favorite book so corny and fake that it was awful! If where a note less than 1 star I would have put! I really hope someone else will come a long time and make this book into the movie that it could have been! Hell could have been as good as Twilight or better if they had followed the BOOK!'",0
"b'Ghost World is a story of transition to adulthood that defines the character of a generation that is one of the most elusive of modern memory. Enid (Thora Birch) is stuck in a small town with peers and adults who are not going anywhere. According to him, only Norman, the long-time passenger, perhaps because he tries at least to leave the city, is not something to say to the public, but rather to think about it. a thoughtful film with attractive characters, a quick wit and a gentle warmth. The composition including the use of color in the set and the costume is lush and crisp; the editing and the camera are very expressive. I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to better understand the life and problems of middle-class youth struggling with identity research at the end of the twentieth century.'",1

"b'As a veteran of Marine and Vietnam, I do not agree with Mr. Brennan\'s portrait of the second half of this film. The war scenes were at best marginal and failed to capture the ""realism"" of the war ... The peloton was much better in this respect. Mainly because Oliver Stone was a veteran himself. However, the training camp scenes in the FMJ were accurate. R.Lee Ermey played to perfection as he should have done with the Drill Instructor, having been the same in real life. I had several D.I. It\'s like that in training camp and I can assure you that it was like that during the Vietnam War. I can laugh at the movie now, but while in training camp there was nothing to laugh about, we were there to learn to fight and to go to war, other skills were learned, but they were secondary. We had to be tough and they made sure we were. Part of the training camp was almost like a documentary for me! That said, the film was like two parts for me. The first half and the second half. One being dead and the other so little and completely based on a Hollywood perception of the war. For those who were not there, believe me ... It was very different from this version. All in all, thanks to the performance of R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D\'Onofrio, I give him 4 stars.'",1
